contribution to society | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the phrase "considered good" refers to a person's reputation or perception among others. The phrase "contribution to society" is commonly associated with positive and impactful actions taken by individuals, which often contribute to a positive reputation. The other options, such as compliments or wearing outrageous clothing, do not necessarily contribute to a person's reputation as being "good."
need money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a retired person may have to return to work if they require additional income. Retirement is usually associated with a period of reduced income when a person is no longer working, and so returning to work may be necessary to supplement their finances. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why a retired person would need to return to work.
victorian style house or older houses | Knowledge: Attics are typically found in older houses, especially those built before the mid-20th century. Victorian style houses are often among this group, as they were built during the 19th century. Basements and own homes are not relevant to the question, and specifically mentioning "victorian house" as a separate option implies that it may not necessarily have an attic.
conquer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the great general had been undefeated until this point but had just suffered his first defeat. This implies that his opponent was able to overcome him in some way, possibly through military conquest or other means of subjugation. Therefore, the correct answer is "conquer." The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence.
madagascar | Knowledge: Madagascar is known for its unique biodiversity, including many species of lemurs and monkeys that are not found anywhere else in the world. Therefore, it is the most likely option for where you could find a monkey in the wild. The other options (friend's house, research laboratory, French government, beach) do not provide a suitable habitat for wild monkeys.
michigan | Knowledge: The Great Lakes are located in the northeastern region of the United States and are bordered by several states, including Michigan, which is known for its shoreline along Lake Michigan. Florida, Kansas City, Maine, and Georgia do not have any direct connection to the Great Lakes and are located in different regions of the country.
tent | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John bought a small butane stove that he can't use inside due to fumes. This suggests that he will need to use it in an outdoor setting. Options such as community kitchen, post office, and apartment do not have any clear connection to outdoor activities, leaving us with two options - friend's house or tent. Since John has bought a small butane stove, it is unlikely that he will need to cook for a large group and a tent may be a more logical option for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or picnics.
closet  | Knowledge: In the context of the sentence, the woman has returned home and needs to store her shirts. The most common place to store clothes in a home is a closet, which makes it the most likely choice for the correct answer. The other options, such as buttons, suitcase, washing machine, and sporting goods store, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
good | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah felt pessimistic about their chances, but Billy disagreed with her. The word "good" implies that he thought their odds were favorable or promising. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive view of their odds, except for "propitious" which also means favorable. However, "propitious" is a less common word and may be less likely to appear in this context.
family reunion | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the family members were gathered together for a special occasion, which is likely to be a family reunion. The fact that they were meeting their niece for the first time also supports this idea, as family reunions often involve members who have not seen each other in a long time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a gathering of family members.
hear things | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the listener has a specific purpose, which is to hear things. Empathy, thirst, knowledge, and learning do not necessarily require listening as their primary means of engagement. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "hear things".
hospital | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dental office handles patients who have experienced traumatic mouth injuries, which implies that these patients have been treated at a hospital before being referred to the dental office. The other options, such as town or office building, do not provide a clear reason for why patients would be experiencing traumatic mouth injuries. Schools may have sports injuries, but it is less likely that they would be referred to a dental office for treatment. Michigan is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
music room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the upright piano was used in a specific setting to improve the quality of the sound that was produced. A music room is a designated space for playing and practicing music, which implies that the piano was used in this context to enhance the sound quality. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
great outdoors | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location in question is not near a body of water where sharks are typically found, but implies that there are other hazards to be aware of. "Great outdoors" is a common phrase that refers to natural environments, which could include things like uneven terrain, wildlife, and extreme weather conditions. The other answer options either specifically reference bodies of saltwater or are not related to the context of the sentence.
mail box | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that pamphlets are being delivered to your home, which commonly happens through the mail. Mailboxes are a common place for mail to be delivered, including flyers or pamphlets. The other options, such as a drawer or the health department, do not make sense in the context of receiving pamphlets at home.
strip mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a clothing store can be found in a location where there are multiple merchants outdoors. This most closely matches the description of a strip mall, which is a collection of shops and stores in one area where customers can park their cars and walk around outside. The other options do not describe a location commonly associated with outdoor shopping and merchants.
office building | Knowledge: The term "cubicle" is commonly used to describe a small, enclosed workspace for employees in an office setting. Corporations are often associated with large office buildings where employees work in cubicles. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "office building." The other options, such as "work" or "restroom," are not typically associated with cubicles.
vcr | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people used to watch movies in their homes, which implies that the technology being referred to is older or outdated. The options "television" and "show" do not fit this description as they are still commonly used today. "Video store" is also less likely as it implies going out to rent a physical copy of a movie. This leaves "vcr" as the most likely option as it was a popular technology used in the past to watch movies at home.
arrive late | Knowledge: The word "behind schedule" implies that the train is running late. Therefore, it is most likely to arrive late. While the train could slow down to ensure a safer journey, this would not necessarily make up for lost time. Arriving early or on time is unlikely if the train is already behind schedule.
amount to nothing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is afraid of failure, which implies that they believe failing will result in them not achieving anything or being successful. "Amount to nothing" means that they will not accomplish anything worthwhile. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
paste | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man learned shortcuts to become more efficient at his work, which likely involves the use of a computer. "Paste" is a commonly used shortcut on a computer, often used to copy and paste text or images. "Soft copy" refers to a digital copy of a document, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Unique" and "ocean" are not related to the topic of computer work or efficiency, and "creation" is too vague to clearly determine its connection to the sentence.
work | Knowledge: The context suggests that the word "office" refers to a place where work is done. The other options - school building, workplace, skyscraper, and public building - may also contain offices, but they are not exclusive to the function of working.
fatigue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that thinking hard and long can cause a physical reaction similar to that experienced during exercise. Like exercising on a treadmill, thinking can tire out the brain and lead to fatigue. The other options (depression, revelation, new thought, knowledge) do not logically follow from the information provided in the sentence.
reproduce | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of laying eggs has a specific purpose for birds, and "reproduce" is the most logical choice as it is a well-known fact that birds reproduce by laying eggs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as birds do not typically pick berries or breathe differently when laying eggs.
defend yourself | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is being attacked, therefore they need to protect themselves from harm. "Defend yourself" is the only option that addresses this need. "Stay alive" is a general advice that may not be useful in the specific situation of being attacked. "Get rid of" and "fall down" are not applicable options in the context of an attack. "Attacked" is simply a repetition of the verb and does not offer any useful information or action.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the ground floor of a certain location is available for overnight accommodation. This is typically associated with hotels, which offer guest rooms and amenities for travelers. Brownstones and highrise buildings may have apartments or offices on the ground floor, but these are not typically used as overnight accommodations for non-residents. Subways and office buildings are also not appropriate options for spending the night.
true | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although the person in question is bad or disliked, their statements or words are still truthful. This implies that the person may have a reputation for being untrustworthy or deceitful, but their statements can still be relied upon for accuracy. The other choices do not have any connection to this context and can be eliminated.
beach | Knowledge: Beach towels are specifically designed for use at the beach, so it is likely to find them there. The other options do not necessarily have any connection to the context of a beach towel. Backpacks are used for carrying personal items, while swimming pools and locker rooms typically have their own towels available for use. Hotel towels may be used at the beach if the hotel is located near a beach, but it is not the most likely place to find a beach towel.
lubricate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of copulation (sexual intercourse) was happening, and someone used spit for a specific purpose. Spit is a natural lubricant and can be used to facilitate sexual intercourse. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Marking territory and releasing tension have no obvious connection to the act of copulation, while kissing and procreation are already implied by the sentence.
embarassment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that answering questions incorrectly will lead to negative consequences, such as embarrassment. This is a common experience for many people, especially in educational settings where the expectation is to answer questions correctly. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question, as they do not necessarily follow from getting a question wrong.
office building | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a professional setting where work is being done. An office building is a common location for a group of work spaces that may contain many computers since they are often essential tools for completing tasks. The other options do not provide a setting that would typically have a group of work spaces or computers.
lay eggs | Knowledge: Birds are known for laying eggs to reproduce, as they are oviparous animals. While some birds may sing songs or sleep together as part of their mating behavior, these actions are not directly related to the process of reproduction. Spreading wings is also not related to reproduction, as all birds have the ability to do so for various reasons such as regulation of body temperature or for flight.
desk or office | Knowledge: A rubber stamp is typically used in a professional or personal setting for stamping documents or letters. Therefore, the most likely options for where to put a rubber stamp after using it are a desk or an office. Table and art class are less likely because they do not have a direct association with stamping documents or letters. Indiana is not a relevant option as it does not relate to the context of using a rubber stamp.
underground | Knowledge: Potatoes are a root vegetable and need to be placed in soil in order to grow. Planting them underground provides the necessary nutrients and environment for the potato to sprout and develop. The other options are not suitable for growing potatoes as they do not provide the necessary conditions for growth.
get back to work | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the union members were on strike and had demands or complaints that they wanted to address. The use of the term "settled" implies that an agreement was reached between the union and their employer, which likely satisfied their demands or addressed their complaints. As a result, the members would "go off strike" and "get back to work". The option "more money" may be a tempting choice, but it is not mentioned in the sentence and does not necessarily follow from the context.
concentrate | Knowledge: The question asks for a mental requirement for beginning detailed work, which suggests that one needs to be able to focus their attention and concentrate. The other options do not relate to mental preparation, but rather physical actions or unrelated tasks.
amusement park | Knowledge: The question specifies that the answer cannot involve water or buying something. Amusement parks fit this criteria as they offer rides and attractions that do not require water and admission usually covers all activities, so buying individual items is not necessary. The other options either involve water (swimming pool) or require purchasing items (airport, toy store) or both (Disneyland).
taxi cab | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John couldn't take the ferret on the bus, so he had to find another mode of transportation. The only option that makes sense in this context is a taxi cab, which is a common mode of transportation for people who cannot take their pets on public transit. The other options are not related to transportation and do not make sense in this context.
meet | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a prerequisite action that needs to be done before going to play with a friend. The correct answer is "meet" because before playing, you need to physically meet with your friend so that you can both go together to the place where you will be playing. The other options do not relate to this context.
relaxation or solitude | Knowledge: Going on vacation on a deserted island suggests getting away from the hustle and bustle of daily life and finding some peace and quiet. This could mean seeking out relaxation through activities like sunbathing, swimming, or lounging on the beach. Alternatively, it could mean pursuing solitude and spending time alone with one's thoughts. The other options do not fit with the idea of a peaceful vacation on a deserted island.
post office | Knowledge: The post office is a common place to send mail. It is a designated location for sending letters and packages, with specialized equipment and personnel to handle mail delivery. The other options, such as table, neighbor's house, railway station, and fridge, do not have any connection to sending mail.
kiss each other | Knowledge: Kissing is a common way for romantic partners to greet each other. This action is associated with intimacy and affection, which are elements that are typically present in romantic relationships. The other answer choices are not related to the context of dating and do not fit with the social norms and expectations of romantic interaction.
Alabama | Knowledge: The question is asking for a country that is not part of the continent south of North America where you would not find a marmoset. The options "another place," "rainforest," and "foreign country" are too vague and do not provide enough information to determine if marmosets are found there. Venezuela is a country located in the continent south of North America and is known to have marmosets. Alabama is a state in the United States and is not part of the continent south of North America, making it the correct answer.
time test | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher has a planned activity that the students will not enjoy, and one possible activity that would fit this description is a time test. Time tests can be stressful and overwhelming for students, and many students do not enjoy taking them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hold water | Knowledge: Communion typically involves the consumption of wine or grape juice, which is usually stored in a glass or chalice. The glass on the wall is likely to be functional and capable of holding liquid, hence the correct answer is "hold water." The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of taking Communion in a church setting, as they do not serve a practical purpose.
skyscraper | Knowledge: The mention of the 8th and top floor suggests that Sally's office is located in a tall building, most likely a skyscraper. Skyscrapers are known for their tall height and multiple floors, which match the description given. The other options do not fit the criteria of having multiple floors as described in the sentence.
kissing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something happens at the end of a sleighing ride that involves a couple. Since sleighing rides are often seen as romantic activities, it is likely that the couple engages in an act of affection, such as kissing, at the end of their ride. The other options are not associated with the context of the sentence, and therefore do not make sense as the answer.
sustaining life | Knowledge: Breathing is a vital process that allows living things to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, which is necessary for the body's cells to carry out various functions. Without oxygen, the body's organs and tissues would not receive the necessary nutrients and energy to survive. Asthma attacks are a respiratory disorder that can impact breathing but do not describe the purpose of breathing itself. Satisfying hunger and warming air are not directly related to the respiratory system or the function of breathing. Giving life is a broad and vague concept that does not specifically relate to the function of breathing.
contrast | Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of likening something to something else, which implies a comparison or similarity. Contrast is the most logical opposite as it suggests a difference or dissimilarity. Discern and distinguish are also related to identifying differences, but don't necessarily imply a comparison. Metaphor and discriminate are not opposites of likening, as metaphor is a literary device used to create comparisons, and discriminate has negative connotations related to prejudice and bias.
cathedral | Knowledge: Organs are commonly associated with religious music, especially in Christian churches such as cathedrals. They are often played during church services and are a prominent feature of cathedral architecture. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
support group | Knowledge: The question talks about being supported by those closest to a person, which suggests that the answer is related to some kind of group or community. The term "support group" specifically refers to a group of people who come together to offer emotional or practical support to one another. The other options do not fit the description of being supported by a group or community.
shelf | Knowledge: The word "pantry" refers to a storage area for food items in a household, typically located in or near the kitchen. The sentence suggests that food is commonly stored on a specific surface within the pantry, and the most likely option is a shelf. A shelf is a flat surface that is able to support items and is commonly used for storage, particularly for food items that can be stacked on top of one another. The other options are less likely to be used for food storage in a pantry setting.
murder | Knowledge: Murder refers to the intentional killing of one person by another, which means that the person who died did not want to die. The other options do not necessarily imply that the person did not want to die. Cyanide and suicide may indicate that the person took their own life, which could be seen as a form of wanting to die. Love and burial are not related to the context of the question.
cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child knows where to find the cereal bowl and is confident that they can reach it. The most likely place for a bowl in a kitchen is a cupboard or cabinet, where dishes and other kitchen items are typically stored. The other options, such as a refrigerator or china shop, do not make sense in the context of looking for a cereal bowl.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James used tools to chop and shape wood, and that he kept adding to what he was building. This is a common process when building a house, where wood is used to construct the frame and walls, and additional layers of wood and other materials are added to create the finished structure. The other options, such as shelterbelt or bus stop, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
phone or computer | Knowledge: Both phones and computers are popular devices used for communication with friends who are not physically present. Smoke and printer do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and having friends is not a device used for communication.
funding | Knowledge: When starting a business, one of the biggest challenges is securing enough money or funding to ensure that the business has enough resources to operate and succeed. While creativity and determination are important qualities for entrepreneurs, they do not guarantee success if the business is underfunded. Capital is also a relevant term, but funding is typically used more frequently when referring to startup businesses. Llamas do not have any connection to opening a business.
death and destruction | Knowledge: The question suggests that something is happening as a result of countries waging war. The options presented are all negative and suggest that something bad is occurring. The phrase "armies having to do" suggests that some action is being taken by the armies. The option "death and destruction" seems to fit the context of the question as it is a common result of war and may be an action taken by armies. The other options are not actions that armies would typically take during a war.
having fun | Knowledge: While football does have its risks, such as head injuries and concussions, the question specifically asks for a "good thing" about playing the sport. It is generally agreed upon that one of the positive aspects of football is the enjoyment and sense of fulfillment that comes from participating in a team sport, honing athletic skills and strategies, and working towards a common goal. The other options listed are all negative outcomes associated with football and therefore do not fit the criteria of a "good thing."
Canada | Knowledge: Apples are typically grown in cooler climates, so it is important to consider which countries in America have a northern location. Brazil is located in South America, so it is not a viable option. The word "fields" does not provide any clues, and "spring" and "outside" are not countries. Therefore, Canada is the logical choice as the northern-most country where an apple tree can grow.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that forgiving someone can lead to a positive emotion, which is commonly associated with happiness. Forgiveness is often seen as a way to let go of negative feelings and move on from a difficult situation, which can lead to a sense of relief and contentment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
answers  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was talking to his friends about important things, which implies that he was seeking some kind of knowledge or information from them. The options "love," "happiness," and "money" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "communication" could be a possibility, but it is not as specific as "answers." Therefore, "answers" seems like the most appropriate choice.
united states | Knowledge: The question is asking for a geographic location of Virginia, which is a state in the United States. Therefore, the correct answer is "united states." The other answer choices are either unrelated or incorrect, as Minnesota and the Virginias are separate states and "south" and "north" are not specific enough to indicate the location of Virginia within the United States.
school | Knowledge: The sentence specifically mentions that the gathering place is in the entrance hall, which is a location typically found in schools. Additionally, the mention of "teachers" suggests an educational setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
criminal prosecution | Knowledge: Perjury is the act of intentionally lying or giving false statements under oath in a legal proceeding. It is considered a crime and can lead to criminal charges, also known as criminal prosecution. Going to jail may be a consequence of being found guilty of perjury, but it is not the name of the crime. Falsehoods and injustices are not specific legal terms, and mistrial refers to a situation where a legal trial has to be stopped and started again due to some error or misconduct.
get money | Knowledge: "Cashing in" usually means exchanging something like a check or coupon for its cash value. In this context, it is most likely referring to receiving money in exchange for something else. The other options are not commonly associated with the phrase "cashing in."
game playing | Knowledge: Poker is a popular card game that involves players making bets based on the perceived value of their hand. The game is played for recreation or fun, but players can also lose money if they make poor decisions. The context of the question indicates that the person is actively engaged in an activity, which is most likely playing a game rather than simply relaxing or having fun. Therefore, the correct answer is game playing. The other options do not accurately reflect what someone would be doing while playing poker.
picture | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people saw a fox in the park and attempted to quickly take out their phones to capture a visual record of the encounter. The word "picture" is the only choice that directly relates to the act of taking a photograph, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
university | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the poet was trying to reach a specific audience of literary majors. It makes sense that he would go to a place where he could find those students, which would likely be a university. A classroom or study may have too limited an audience, while a bookstore or home wouldn't necessarily attract the right kind of reader.
physical exertion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was hiking for miles, which would likely cause physical strain on the body. The other answer options such as sweating or cramps may be symptoms of physical exertion, but they do not accurately capture the main cause of the person's discomfort. Smiling does not relate to the context of the sentence, and deliriousness may be a more severe symptom that is not necessarily implied by the sentence.
dump | Knowledge: Refuse refers to trash or waste, and it is commonly stored in a dump for a long time until it is eventually disposed of or recycled. An incinerator is used to burn waste, a wastebasket or garbage can are small containers designed for temporary storage of waste in a house or business, and the options waste basket and garbage can are essentially the same thing. Therefore, the correct answer is dump.
accomplish goals | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was working hard for herself, which implies that she was striving to achieve something. The phrase "accomplish goals" reflects this idea and is the most appropriate answer. The other options ("headache," "popularity," "take rest," "get laid") do not make sense in the context of the sentence or contradict the idea that the woman was working hard for herself.
lose weight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that gaining a lot of fat is not healthy, and the doctor's recommendation is likely to be related to reducing the amount of fat on the body. The term "lose weight" specifically refers to reducing body weight, which can be accomplished through a variety of methods like changes in diet or exercise. The other options do not convey the idea of actively reducing the amount of body fat. "loosing" and "loosing" are incorrect spellings of "losing." "Loss" is a noun and does not imply an action that the person should take. "Reduce" is a more general term and does not specifically address the issue of body fat.
diary or journal | Knowledge: In this context, writing down a passage suggests a personal activity, rather than a professional or religious one. Therefore, options like labyrinth, bible, and hotel do not fit. A diary and a journal are both personal writing formats that allow one to record their thoughts and experiences. The difference between the two is mostly in the frequency and purpose of writing, with a diary typically being more frequent and focused on daily occurrences, and a journal being more occasional and reflective.
stage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are musicians performing live and people are listening to them, which usually happens on a stage. A stage is a platform where performers can showcase their talents to an audience. The other options do not involve live performances, but rather places where one might find musicians or music-related items, such as a studio for recording music, a music store for purchasing instruments or recordings, a symphony or orchestra for classical music performances.
friendship | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy and Dan have a long history together, which implies a level of trust and understanding. This is further emphasized by the fact that they were able to come to an agreement without needing a contract or compliance, which would suggest a more formal or business-like relationship. Harmony is also a possibility, but it is less specific to the context of the sentence. Death threats are clearly irrelevant and can be eliminated as a choice.
couch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny was in a place where humans relax, and he stayed too long, causing him to potentially miss his flight. The options "bathroom," "airport," and "bed" do not fit the criteria of a place for relaxation. "Homes" is too broad and could refer to any part of a house, while "couch" specifically refers to a piece of furniture designed for sitting or lying down and relaxing.
lower | Knowledge: The question describes a situation where something has been lifted and needs to be returned to its original position. The verb "lower" is the most appropriate choice as it means to move something down or to a lower position. The other options, such as "fall" and "below" may also suggest downward movement, but they do not convey the deliberate and controlled lowering of an object. "Sun set" and "place" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
dying | Knowledge: The phrase "grave injury" suggests that the person is seriously hurt and their condition is deteriorating, leading to the conclusion that they are dying. The option "victory" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it suggests a positive outcome, whereas the sentence clearly indicates a negative outcome. The option "casualties" refers to a group and not an individual and does not reflect the specific situation described in the sentence. The option "protect yourself" does not fit the sentence as it is not a possible outcome for someone with a grave injury. The option "death" is also a possible outcome, but it is not the one indicated in the sentence, as the person is still alive but in critical condition.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher's pet enjoyed answering questions and was rewarded with something positive for each correct answer. The word "more" implies that the reward was increasing over time, which rules out the options of hate and confusion. Teaching and panic do not make sense in this context. Satisfaction is the most appropriate option as it is a positive feeling that can be easily associated with answering questions correctly.
sunny days | Knowledge: The person's negative feelings towards the cold rain suggests that they would prefer a warmer, more pleasant type of weather. The option "sunny days" directly relates to this, as sunny weather is often associated with warmth and brightness. The other options, such as peace or compliments, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
switzerland | Knowledge: The context suggests that the person visited Switzerland, as the sentence mentions a famous mountain (which could be the Matterhorn or the Swiss Alps) and sampling chocolates, which Switzerland is known for. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cave | Knowledge: A long, dark passageway is typically associated with a cave or subterranean environment, where the lack of natural light creates a dark and mysterious atmosphere. Such a passageway would not typically be found in a hotel, bathroom, airport, or house, as these environments are usually designed to be well-lit with artificial or natural light sources.
library | Knowledge: Libraries often keep archives of old magazines, making them a likely place to find old or outdated issues. Markets, doctors' offices, and tables are not typically associated with old magazines. The duplicate option of "library" reinforces the likelihood of this being the correct answer.
remain stable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that George did not like changes to his salary, which indicates that he preferred a stable or consistent supply of money. The other options, such as stagnant, constant, unpleasant, or permanent, do not accurately describe George's desired state for his salary.
post office | Knowledge: Sending mail is typically done at a post office or a postal service center. The term "over the counter" refers to the act of physically handing your mail to a clerk or representative at a service counter. Candy stores, butcher shops, and kitchens are not places where mail is commonly sent or received, and "animals" is not a relevant or appropriate answer.
desktop | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James connected the new monitor to something that would allow him to use it to display images, indicating that it was likely connected to a computer or other device with display capabilities. The options "internet cafe" and "view bluescreen" do not make sense in this context, and "box" is not a viable option for connecting a monitor. Therefore, "desktop" is the most logical answer.
fishing boat | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the context is related to fishing, since it mentions cleaning a catch. The other options like table or kitchen drawer are not related to fishing, while pocket and board do not make sense in the context of cleaning a catch. Therefore, the correct answer must be fishing boat, which is the most logical vessel to use when cleaning a fish caught while fishing.
baking soda | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the pioneer is in need of specific baking supplies, and one common baking ingredient is baking soda. Barrels, pepper, and salt are unlikely to be used in baking, and small town is not a type of baking supply.
novel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person worked extensively with a dictionary, which could indicate that they were writing a piece of literature that required a lot of research and attention to detail in their language use. The option "eat cake" is clearly not related to the context of the sentence, and the others could potentially be used for research in writing, but the use of a dictionary specifically points towards writing a novel as the best answer.
broken bones | Knowledge: When a person falls, there is a high likelihood of getting injured, and broken bones are one of the most common injuries. Falling can cause a person's body to land on a hard surface, which can put a lot of pressure on one or more bones and cause them to break or fracture. While falling can also cause pain and injury without breaking bones, the specific wording of the question suggests that the answer is related to a specific type of injury, which is broken bones. The other options are either too general or do not accurately reflect the potential consequences of falling.
new york city | Knowledge: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, commonly referred to as "the Met," is located in New York City. The sentence specifically mentions that Sean took a subway stop, which is a common mode of transportation in New York City. The other options do not have a well-known museum or attraction called "the Met" and do not have a clear association with subway systems.
play games | Knowledge: The context of a "cookout with friends" suggests a social gathering where adults are likely to engage in leisure activities. While drinking beer and smoking cigarettes are possible activities, they are not necessarily the most common or defining aspects of a cookout. Dressing oneself is a basic everyday activity, and driving a vehicle may or may not be necessary for attending the cookout. Playing games, however, is a common and social activity at cookouts and aligns with the context of the question.
stay here | Knowledge: The sentence implies that George is in need of a place to stay, and the speaker offers to let him do so. The phrase "didn't have any place to go" indicates that George does not have a specific destination in mind, but needs a place to reside for the time being. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
surf net | Knowledge: Boredom often prompts people to seek out entertainment or distractions. Of the given choices, "surf net" seems to be the most likely option for finding a variety of activities to alleviate boredom. Talking to a phone or seeing something new may not be effective ways to combat boredom. Playing cards or chess can be entertaining, but may not be readily available on a mobile phone.
desert | Knowledge: The question suggests that planners are considering the location of Disneyland, and the answer choice "desert" is relevant because California has several desert regions. Disneyland may be located in a desert to take advantage of the sunny weather and generally dry climate, which can make it easier to maintain park facilities and provide visitors with enjoyable experiences. The other answer choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
anxiety | Knowledge: The word "shy" suggests that the person is uncomfortable or nervous in social situations, especially when meeting new people. Anxiety is a common feeling for shy individuals when they are faced with meeting new people. Stress may also be a possibility, but it is less likely to be the correct answer since the sentence specifically mentions being shy. Being bored and smiling are not related to the feeling of a shy person when meeting others, and making new friends is a potential outcome but not necessarily the immediate feeling.
engagement | Knowledge: The question is asking for a potential reaction when the speaker starts communicating with others. Among the choices, engagement seems to be the most appropriate because it suggests an active involvement and interest from the other party, which is the desired outcome of communication. The other options such as "people to think" and "distributed information" do not necessarily imply a reaction from the other party, while "exchanging ideas" and "sharing of knowledge" could be seen as an outcome rather than a reaction.
heat up | Knowledge: Turning up the thermostat typically means increasing the temperature setting, which results in the heating system producing more heat. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the temperature would increase. The options that suggest a decrease in temperature or dropping to zero are incorrect, as they are the opposite of what would happen when the thermostat is turned up.
house | Knowledge: The context suggests that Jane's concern is related to fire or burning something, and that the item she is worried about burning is located in her own home. The only option that fits this description is "house." The other options are unrelated to the sentence's context or do not match the details provided.
locker room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking a shower in a particular location can be intimidating for shy kids in school. The most likely location for this scenario is a locker room, where students often change and shower in a shared space. The other options, such as a bath room, motel room, pool, or hotel, do not typically involve shared shower facilities and are therefore less likely to be intimidating for shy kids.
whatever | Knowledge: The sentence states that John would do anything, which suggests that he doesn't have any particular preference or care about what he does. The phrase "whatever" is often used to indicate a lack of preference or indifference, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not have a clear connection to the sentence's meaning.
toy store | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about where to acquire an action figure. The options "eat cake," "theater," and "bathtub" do not provide a plausible answer to this question, as they are not places where one would typically find or purchase an action figure. However, "little boy's toy box" may seem like a possible answer, but it is not a guaranteed source of an action figure, whereas a toy store explicitly sells toys, including action figures.
own brain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is studying anatomy and is aware of the main artery in the neck. Given that the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body through arteries, it is likely that the person is referring to the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. The other options, such as "busy city," "thruway," "hand," and "neck," do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
basement  | Knowledge: Fungus can grow in damp and humid environments, such as basements. The other choices may not provide the necessary environment for fungus to grow on walls, except for maybe a shower stall or bathroom. However, those options may also include tile or other materials that do not provide the necessary conditions for fungus growth on walls.
sitting down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was unable to stand up from his current position at his desk, which indicates that he was likely sitting down. The other options, such as kneeling or lying down, do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a different posture altogether.
test tube | Knowledge: The word "drop" in the sentence suggests that the answer must be something small and contained, and "flood" suggests that it is something related to liquids. A test tube is a small container often used in lab settings to hold and manipulate small amounts of liquid, so it is the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
England | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a country whose heir to the throne is not the prince of it, which narrows down the options to actual countries. The term "prince" is commonly associated with monarchy and England is a well-known monarchy. The other options do not provide any clear indication of a monarchy or an heir to the throne.
orphanage | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child in question does not have a home. Therefore, it is likely that the child would go to a place that provides shelter, such as an orphanage. Schools and recreational areas are not typically designed to provide long-term housing, and "most homes" does not make sense in the context provided. "Pen" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not provide any clues to a potential solution for a homeless child.
bodies of water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crabs are moving along the bottom of some type of body of water. The options "fish market" and "aquarium" do not fit the context of the sentence, as crabs in those locations would not typically be crawling along the bottom of anything. "Saltwater" is a possibility, but it is too broad and does not provide enough specificity. "Galapagos" is also too specific and does not fit the general context of the sentence, which suggests that the crabs could be in any body of water. Therefore, the correct answer is "bodies of water."
finish food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is eating a lot because they are trying to finish their food. This could be because they don't like wasting food or because they feel obligated to eat everything on their plate. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
wallflower | Knowledge: The term "wallflower" is often used to describe someone who is shy or socially awkward, and who may not feel comfortable dancing or mingling at a social event. This person might feel more comfortable standing against the wall, away from the crowds, hence the term "wallflower." The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence, or do not convey the same meaning as "wallflower."
automobile accidents | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described is a common experience for people who drive cars. The phrase "seen or been in" also suggests that it is an action or event that is witnessed or experienced by the driver. Among the given choices, only automobile accidents match these criteria, as they are a common occurrence and can be experienced by both drivers and passengers. The other choices do not fit the given context.
plentitude | Knowledge: The sentence describes someone who has an insatiable desire for more, suggesting that they are never satisfied. The word "plentitude" means a fullness or abundance of something, which fits with the idea of always wanting more. "Presence," "overabundance," "stockpile," and "Mormon" do not accurately express this idea.
fruit market | Knowledge: The options that are related to household items or appliances such as grocery cart, kitchen, and fridge are not plausible choices as they do not sell fruit directly from growers. Supermarket could be a plausible answer, but it is a generic term that could refer to any type of grocery store. A fruit market, on the other hand, specifically suggests a place where fruits are sold, often directly by the growers themselves.
wallet or purse | Knowledge: A dollar bill is a form of currency that is typically carried in a wallet or purse. These two options are the most likely choices as they are specifically designed to hold personal belongings, including money. A pocket may also be a viable option, but it is less secure and may be more prone to losing the dollar bill. The options "mailbox" and "buy coke" do not make sense in the context of the question.
moving forward | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James walked for a specific purpose, rather than just for enjoyment or exercise. The phrase "moving forward" makes the most sense in this context, as it suggests that James was using walking as a means of transportation to get from one place to another. The other options (losing weight, blisters, meditation) do not fit as well with the context provided.
prisoner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned had a newfound appreciation for living in a free country, implying that they were once deprived of their freedom. The word "abroad" suggests that this experience may have happened in a foreign country, which narrows down the potential options. "Prisoner" is the most fitting option, as it directly relates to loss of freedom and imprisonment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
two hands | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people use something to carry things, which narrows the options down to "two hands" and "carry bags." However, the phrase "most people have" implies that the answer should be a natural part of the body rather than an external object. The other options, such as "two eyes," "ears," and "two arms" do not relate to carrying objects as directly as hands.
peace | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when nations agree with each other, a positive outcome will result. The context implies that this outcome is likely to be a desirable one, which rules out options like "problem." Additionally, the sentence suggests that the outcome will involve cooperation and harmony, which makes "peace" the most logical answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
carpet | Knowledge: The phrase "keep my floor covering down" suggests that the speaker wants to secure a material to the floor. The only option that is a type of floor covering is carpet, so the tack should be put into the carpet to keep it down. The other options are either not related to floor coverings or are not capable of holding anything down. Additionally, the correct spelling of the option is "bulletin board."
human face | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lips are found on a particular part of the body, which is narrowed down to a specific category of body parts in the choices. The term "human face" is the most closely related option and is the correct answer. The other options, such as "body" or "knee," do not accurately reflect the location of lips on the human body.
superfluous or useless (either answer could be correct) | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's efforts were unnecessary and did not accomplish anything, so any choice that indicates this would be correct. "Superfluous" means unnecessary or excessive, while "useless" means having no practical value or purpose. Both of these choices accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Swap cs" and "unneeded" do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not accurately reflect the idea that the efforts were unnecessary and accomplished nothing.
pharmacy | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine, which eliminates options like grocery store and drugstore. A mini mall and shop are too vague and could potentially sell a variety of products, so the most logical answer would be a pharmacy. Pharmacies typically sell personal care items like suntan lotion, but do not typically sell food or other non-medical products.
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person driving the car had a heart attack while traveling at a high speed. This is a dangerous situation that can result in a serious accident and potentially a fatality, which would make death the most appropriate answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
brown hair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trait being referred to is genetically determined and located on top of one's head. Out of the choices given, only brown hair fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
table | Knowledge: Condiments are typically used to enhance the flavor of food and are often placed within easy reach during meals. The kitchen and pantry are storage areas and not typically where condiments are kept while in use. The refrigerator is used to keep condiments fresh and safe to consume over a longer period of time, but they may not be easily accessible if they are chilled. A container could be used to hold condiments but is not specific to the context of the question, whereas the table is the most common location for placing condiments within reach during meals.
None of the choices are correct as they all suggest negative or punitive options. The question is not clear and may need to be rephrased or given more context.
supermarket | Knowledge: The most likely place for Sally to buy bubblegum is a supermarket or grocery store. These types of stores typically carry a wide variety of candy and gum, and it is common for customers to pick up a pack of gum during a shopping trip. The other options are less likely scenarios for buying gum: theater might have concessions, but not typically bubblegum, street and pocket suggest that Sally obtained it somehow surreptitiously, and church is not a place typically associated with selling bubblegum.
anguish | Knowledge: The question implies that the person who is getting divorced does not want it, which suggests that they may experience negative emotions as a result. The word "induce" also suggests that the divorce is causing or bringing about something in the person. "Freedom" and "joy" are unlikely choices because divorce is not typically associated with such positive emotions. "Depression" and "anguish" are more likely possibilities, as divorce involves the end of a relationship and can be a difficult and stressful process. "Tears" could also be a possibility, as crying is a common reaction to emotional pain.
park | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is enjoying the great outdoors, which suggests they are in a location where they would likely find a park. Parks often have trash cans available for visitors to dispose of their waste, making it the most likely choice among the options given. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fall asleep | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question struggles to focus when reading, so instead they pretend to read. The fact that the sentence mentions falling asleep as an option suggests that the person is easily distracted and may struggle to stay awake while reading. The other options do not align with this idea and have no obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
new york city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James' deli is located in a city with a significant history, which is often associated with New York City. Landmarks are typically located in major cities, and New York is well known for its historical landmarks. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bearable | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the task was difficult but manageable, which suggests that it was bearable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: controvertible means open to dispute, interesting means engaging or stimulating, easy means not difficult, and agreeable means pleasant or enjoyable.
planetarium | Knowledge: The options shed, atmosphere, photo, and outdoors are all natural settings where the sky is not considered to be fake. In a planetarium, however, the sky is artificially created using projectors and screens, which means that it is not the real sky seen outdoors. Therefore, the correct answer is planetarium.
were religious | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason the players knelt to pray was related to their religiosity, as the action of praying is typically associated with religious practice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that the players were being watched, scared, or trying to communicate with a god who hears them.
ship's hold | Knowledge: The phrase "cargo" suggests that the answer is related to transportation or storage of goods. The option "at sea" is not specific enough and could refer to any location on the water. "Aeroplane" and "airplane" are modes of transportation that are not typically associated with cargo storage. "Boat" is a general term that does not specify a type of storage location. "Ship's hold" is a specific term used to describe the lower part of a ship where cargo is stored.
cry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the visit to the museum evoked strong emotions in the old veteran, and he tried to hide it. Crying is a common physical manifestation of emotional distress, and therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have the same emotional connotation as crying and do not match the context of the sentence.
square shape | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the rooms in the experimental home had a feature that set them apart from traditional rooms. The use of the word "unique" suggests that this feature was unusual or unexpected. The option "square shape" makes the most sense in this context, as traditional rooms are typically square or rectangular in shape. The other options ("possessions in," "high walls," "doors and windows," and "triangles") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
trial | Knowledge: The word "fair" suggests that a process or system is being assessed for its impartiality and justice. In civil law, a trial is a judicial proceeding in which evidence is presented, witnesses are called, and a decision is made by a judge or jury based on the facts of the case. A trial is considered a fair and impartial way to reach a decision because both sides have an opportunity to present their case, and the decision is based on the evidence presented. The other options do not relate to the idea of assessing fairness in a civil action.
workplace | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who do the same kind of work gather in a particular location. The workplace is the obvious choice since it's where people would go every day to do their job. A convention could also be a possibility, but it's not a daily occurrence and would depend on the specific industry. The other options, such as a train station, wedding, and theater, don't seem to have any clear connection to people gathering based on their profession.
become full | Knowledge: Eating dinner typically results in the feeling of being full, as the body begins to digest the food. Heartburn and indigestion may occur if the food is not properly digested, but these symptoms are not always present after eating dinner. Becoming tired may also happen after eating, but it is not a universal occurrence and thus isn't a reliable answer. Flatulence can happen, but it is not a commonly experienced effect of eating dinner.
run aground | Knowledge: Running aground means that a ship has hit the seabed, reef or any other underwater obstacle, causing it to stop moving forward. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Near shore" or "sail on sea" do not necessarily mean a ship will stop moving. "A Romulian space craft" is a reference to Star Trek and is not a realistic scenario. "Heading east" does not provide any relevant information about why a ship would stop moving.
run out of steam | Knowledge: "Run out of steam" is a common idiomatic expression that means to become exhausted or to lose energy. This expression is often associated with trains because steam locomotives require a constant supply of steam to operate, and if the steam supply runs out, the train will stop moving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of trains or exhaustion.
hospital | Knowledge: Hospitals are commonly associated with beds because they are used to provide a comfortable resting place for patients. Rest areas may have some beds, but not as many as hospitals. Bedford is a place name, not related to beds. The neighbor's house and loft may have beds, but it is unlikely there would be a lot of them.
Chicago | Knowledge: The question specifies that it is referring to the mid-western U.S., which rules out options like Manhattan and New York City, which are located on the East Coast. The reference to skyscrapers suggests that the answer is likely to be a large city with a significant number of high-rise buildings, which narrows the options down to Chicago and other major cities in the region. However, the fact that Chicago is known for its tall buildings, such as the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower), makes it the most likely correct answer.
anxiety | Knowledge: The question implies that there may be negative consequences associated with having a medical checkup. Anxiety is a common emotional response to medical appointments, as people may be worried about their health or the possibility of receiving bad news. Pain is a possibility, but not necessarily a common outcome of a checkup, and good behavior and uncertainty do not make sense in this context. Stress is a possibility, but anxiety is a more specific and commonly associated emotion with medical checkups.
accomplishment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the prize being competed for is prestigious, which implies that it is highly regarded and respected. The fact that the prize has no money suggests that it is not a financial award, but rather a recognition of achievement or excellence. The word "competing" also implies that the individual is seeking to attain something of value, which points towards accomplishment as the correct answer. The other options, such as enemies, rivalry, or bad blood, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with a prestigious prize.
pantry | Knowledge: The word "stored" suggests that the flour was kept in a designated place for safekeeping. The options "grocery store" and "table" are unlikely because they suggest a public space or a communal area, whereas the sentence implies that the flour was being kept in a private household. The options "cupboard" and "kitchen" are possible but not as specific as "pantry," which is a dedicated storage space for food in many homes.
oscilloscope | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is explaining a type of screen that uses a cathode ray tube, which is a type of vacuum tube commonly used in older technology. However, the sentence also specifies that this screen is used to measure things, which suggests that it is an oscilloscope, which is a device used to graphically display and analyze electronic signals. The other options, such as television and computer, do not typically use an oscilloscope for their display.
rejected | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a consequence for not signing a contract. Typically, if a contract is not signed, it is considered incomplete and therefore invalid. That means it can be rejected, as it lacks the necessary signature(s) to make it legally enforceable. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb" is slang and unrelated, "written on paper" is obvious and not a consequence, "signed" is the opposite of what is being discussed, and "revised" implies that the contract has already been changed or edited, which is not mentioned in the question.
hardware store | Knowledge: The combination of cord, nails, and bolts suggests that this is a location where hardware or DIY supplies are sold. The delivery room, sporting goods store, and office do not typically stock these items, so they can be eliminated. The garage could be a possibility, but it is not a specific enough answer - many different types of items could be stored in a garage. Therefore, the best choice is the hardware store, as this is where one would expect to find all three of these items together.
diminishment | Knowledge: Elevation sickness is a condition caused by exposure to high altitudes, which can cause a number of symptoms including headache, fatigue, and confusion. The word "wits" in the sentence refers to the climber's mental faculties, which may be affected by elevation sickness. The word "diminishment" means a reduction or decrease in something, which accurately describes the climber's situation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the meaning of the word "wits."
seizure | Knowledge: The sentence mentions flashing lights causing something bad to happen to James. One possible explanation for this is that James experienced a seizure, which can be triggered by flashing lights for some people who have epilepsy. The other options do not have any clear connection to seizures or flashing lights.
not very much | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that printing too much money can lead to inflation. Therefore, printing "not very much" money would be the appropriate action to take to combat inflation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have money | Knowledge: Shopping involves purchasing goods or services, which requires a form of payment. Money is the most commonly used method of payment, which is why it is necessary for someone to have money in order to shop. The other options, such as sleeping or bringing flowers, are not related to the act of shopping. "Get money" could be a possible answer, but it is less specific than "have money" and doesn't clarify from where the money should come.
show affection | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of greeting with a kiss is a way to do something simple. This likely refers to a simple way to show affection or greeting, which is a common custom in many cultures. The other options (manipulate, companion, separate, electrical circuit) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the dog was barking loudly, but James was not scared because it was confined. The most likely place for a dog to be confined would be a backyard since it allows the dog some room to move around while still being enclosed. The other options - kitchen cupboard, front door, table, and park - do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable place for a dog to be confined.
deck of cards | Knowledge: The context suggests that the magician was able to make a guess about the identity of something or someone based on his skills. The choices "hierarchy" and "court" are less likely to be linked to such a guess. Additionally, the term "game" is used twice in the sentence, suggesting that the answer may be related to a game. The options "chess game" and "chess set" are related to chess, but the magician may not necessarily have been good at chess. Thus, the most appropriate option would be "deck of cards" as this is a game commonly associated with magicians and guessing games.
turn left | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the blinking light is located on the driver's side of the car, which is typically where the turn signal is located. The options "slow down," "go forward," and "get to town" do not make sense as they do not involve the use of a turn signal. The remaining options, "turn left" and "turn right," both involve the use of a turn signal, but the position of the blinking light on the driver's side suggests that the driver intends to turn left.
own property | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the person is interested in houses, which suggests that their end goal is to become a homeowner and own a property. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context and do not align with the goal of purchasing a home.
switzerland | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the dairy cow farm provided milk for a big chocolate company, which suggests that the company is located in Switzerland. Switzerland is known for its chocolate production, so it is likely that the company mentioned in the sentence is based there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the dairy or chocolate industries.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "choreographed moves on the field," which suggests a performance that involves movement. Additionally, the fact that the person is playing the saxophone suggests that they are part of a musical group or ensemble. The options "music store" and "store sells instruments" do not relate to a performance, while "actors" and "orchestra" do not involve movement on a field.
feeling good | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that John enjoyed the sensations of being in the bath, which suggests that he found the experience pleasurable. The other options do not necessarily imply pleasure or enjoyment, and some may even contradict the idea of relaxation, such as invigorating or deep breathing.
wisconsin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that bald eagles can be found along the Mississippi River in a specific state. Wisconsin is a state that touches the Mississippi River, so it is a likely choice. Iowa and Canada also have portions of the river running through them, but the sentence specifically asks for a state. Currency and New Mexico have no connection to the Mississippi River or bald eagles.
friendship | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James wants to socialize more as he feels he lacks a certain aspect. The context of the sentence implies that James is looking for social interaction and connection with other people, which is often associated with building friendships. The other options such as free time, entertainment, and input do not specifically relate to the need for socializing or building connections with others. "Meet people" may be a contender, but it does not suggest the desired outcome of building relationships.
romania | Knowledge: The Carpathian Mountains are located in Romania, which eliminates the other answer choices. The sentence also suggests that the country is located furthest in the direction of the side that won the U.S. Civil War, which can be interpreted as being in Europe, since the war was not fought there. Romania is the only answer choice that is in Europe, and it was a part of the Allies, who were the side that won the war.
plebeian | Knowledge: The Roman Empire had a stratified class system with distinct privileges and rights assigned to certain groups. People who were not born into noble families were referred to as plebeians, while those of noble birth were referred to as patricians. The other options, such as inferior and ignoble, do not carry the same connotation and are not specific to the context of the Roman Empire.
farmyard | Knowledge: A motionless horse is most likely to be found in a stationary setting, such as a farmyard or stable, rather than in a racing or wild environment. The other options, such as Washington (a state or city) or a painting, do not suggest a location where a motionless horse might realistically be found.
idaho | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the farmer was looking for an apple tree cultivar that is hardy in the western United States. Out of the given choices, only Idaho is located in the western region of the United States. The other options are located in the northeastern and southern regions of the country, which suggests they may not be suitable for planting the apple tree cultivar that the farmer is looking for.
delicious food | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person in question is at a restaurant, which is typically a place where one goes to eat. The other options, such as self esteem, compliments, easy life, and fulfillment, are not things that one typically seeks out at a restaurant. Delicious food, on the other hand, is a common reason for going to a restaurant and is therefore the most likely answer.
drinking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teenagers were engaging in reckless behavior, and while some of the other choices may also suggest inappropriate behavior, drinking is specifically mentioned as the activity they were engaging in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feel loved | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mom enjoyed helping her children, which is often associated with feeling loved and appreciated. Parents are typically motivated to help their children because they love and care for them, not because of any legal obligation or financial gain. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the mom liked giving assistance to her children.
nest | Knowledge: The question is asking about something that a bird may have in a tree. A nest is a structure that birds build in trees to lay their eggs and raise their young. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or to anything commonly associated with birds in trees.
strip mall | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the dental office is located in close proximity to a candy store and fast food location, which is a common occurrence in strip malls. Strip malls are typically small shopping centers that are located along busy streets or highways and usually have a mix of retail stores, restaurants, and service providers like dental offices. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Kansas City | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the area in question is known for its steakhouses, which narrows down the options to only a few. Maine, Florida, and Michigan don't have a particularly strong association with steakhouses, while Arizona is a large state with a variety of culinary traditions. Kansas City, however, is known for its barbecue and steak, which makes it the most likely answer.
four seasons | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Earth goes through a cycle of changes over a period of time, which is a characteristic commonly associated with the four seasons. Seasons are a natural occurrence that happen every year and are caused by the Earth's tilt and its orbit around the sun. The other options are not related to the Earth's seasonal changes.
acknowledgment | Knowledge: The question implies that there may be a reason for someone to stay in a relationship with a man. Of the provided choices, acknowledgment is the most likely reason. Acknowledgment could mean that the person wants to feel appreciated or recognized by their partner. The other options do not provide a clear reason why someone would stay in a relationship with a man.
get married | Knowledge: Starting a family traditionally involves getting married, as marriage is often seen as a commitment to building a life together and supporting one another in raising children. While having sex and getting pregnant may be part of starting a family, they do not necessarily require a committed partnership like marriage. Spending money and being stressed are not directly related to the process of starting a family.
barrel | Knowledge: The use of the word "spilled out" implies that the plastic monkeys were contained in something, likely a container with an opening at the top. A barrel is a common type of container with an open top that could hold many toys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
straightforward | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opposite of being ridiculous is being straightforward. Ridiculousness implies a sense of absurdity or foolishness, which is the opposite of being straightforward, which implies being direct and honest. The other options may be associated with different emotions, but they do not have a clear connection to the topic of ridiculousness.
rural area | Knowledge: Bald eagles are known to live in areas with access to bodies of water, as they primarily feed on fish. Rural areas can offer ample access to both water and undisturbed natural habitats, making them a more likely location to spot a wild bald eagle. The other options, such as painting, zoo, and aviary, do not offer live views of a bald eagle in a natural setting. While it is possible to see bald eagles in Colorado, the question does not provide any specific location or context, so it would be safer to choose the general answer of "rural area."
large house | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the drawing room was one of fifty rooms, which suggests that it was located in a large house rather than a smaller residence such as a kid's house or a studio. The options "house in England" and "mansion" could both potentially refer to a large house, but there is no clear context or information in the sentence to suggest that the location was specifically in England or that it was a grand and luxurious mansion.
beach | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the beauty is caused by the reflection of sunshine, which is often associated with bodies of water. When the sun's rays reflect off the water, they create a sparkling effect that can be visually stunning. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not typically involve sunlight reflections or visual beauty.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thirsty and has an empty glass. It is logical to assume that the person wants to fill the glass with water or some kind of beverage. The most common place to put a glass when you want to fill it is on a table. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence: a refrigerator is the appliance that is used to keep food and drinks cold, a dishwasher is used for washing dishes, a water cooler is a device that dispenses cold water, and a dining room is a room where people eat meals.
leave | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there wasn't enough space for Samantha to join the game, which implies that someone else was already playing. Therefore, for Samantha to join, someone else had to leave in order to free up space. The other options do not make sense in this context.
food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is watching his calorie intake, which means he likely wants to reduce his overall consumption of calories. Since the drink was very sweet, it probably contained a lot of sugar or other sweeteners that can contribute significantly to one's daily caloric intake. In order to offset this, John may want to consume less food overall to keep his calorie count in check. The other options, such as throwing up or stumbling, do not logically connect to the context of the sentence.
lead pencil | Knowledge: Graphite is commonly used as the core material in pencils, which are traditionally made with a wooden barrel and an eraser at the end. However, despite its name, "lead" is not actually used in pencils anymore due to its toxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "lead pencil" since it reflects the common usage of graphite in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
go to bed early | Knowledge: The question is asking for an assumption about people who get up early. One common reason for getting up early is to start the day early, which may require going to bed early to ensure enough sleep. Therefore, we can assume that people who get up early often go to bed early. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context and cannot be assumed with certainty.
museum | Knowledge: A sword is a type of weapon or tool that is typically displayed in museums or collections. A container called a scabbard or a sheath is used to hold a sword, but it is not where someone would go to see one on display. A school is also an unlikely location to see a sword. Therefore, the correct answer is museum.
record player | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys listening to music and is particular about the quality of sound. The term "audiophile" refers to someone who is passionate about high-quality sound reproduction. The phrase "replaced the stylus almost as often as he switched albums" suggests that the person is using a device such as a record player, which requires a stylus to play vinyl records. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
tropics | Knowledge: Lizards are cold-blooded animals that require warmth to regulate their body temperature. The tropics are known for being warm and humid, which can provide an ideal environment for lizards that need warmth. The other options do not offer a clear indication of a warm environment that would appeal to a lizard. A garden, for example, could be cool or damp, while a forest may offer shade and shelter but not necessarily the warmth that a lizard needs to thrive.
cleaning | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the picture was easy to see, and this clarity could be attributed to a recent cleaning. When pictures or surfaces are dirty or murky, they tend to be less clear and more difficult to see. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
happy | Knowledge: The question asks what everyone tries their whole life to be. This suggests that the answer is a universal goal or desire. We can eliminate options like "sad" and "cat" because they are not something people actively strive for. "Grow old" is a natural process that happens to everyone, but not necessarily something they try to achieve. "Believed" does not make sense in this context. This leaves us with "happy," which is a common goal for people, suggesting that it is the correct answer.
anxiety | Knowledge: The word "preceded" suggests that the act of meditation comes before meeting people, indicating that it is done to prepare for the social interaction. The context suggests that this preparation is due to a negative feeling or state, and the option "anxiety" is commonly linked to social anxiety, which can lead someone to feel overwhelmed by social interactions. The other options, such as "love" or "making new friends," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ridiculous | Knowledge: The word "silly" suggests that Billy found something about the turtle's movements to be ridiculous, which is a synonym for silly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
congress | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the question is related to governmental proceedings. The word "argue" suggests a debate or discussion, which is typically associated with the legislative process in a country. The other options, such as mail box, post office, restaurant, and trash, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or to the topic of government proceedings.
office building | Knowledge: Freezers are typically found in homes and sometimes in garages. They are also sold in appliance stores for consumers to purchase. However, it is unlikely that an office building would have a freezer as it is not a necessary appliance for typical office work. Similarly, a flat may or may not have a freezer depending on the owner's preference and needs.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady needs to buy a lot of items and has limited time, so she needs to go to a place where she can find many things in one location. Supermarkets are known for offering a wide variety of items, including groceries, household goods, and personal care products, all in one place, making them a convenient option for someone with limited time. The other options do not fit the criteria of offering a wide variety of items in one location.
appliance store | Knowledge: The question is asking where to obtain a freezer, which implies that the person currently does not have one. The options "icy cold," "own home," and "garage" do not make sense as places to obtain a freezer. "Freeze food" is also incorrect because it describes an action (freezing food) rather than a location or source. The correct answer is "appliance store" because they sell refrigerators and freezers.
dust poisoning | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person doing housework is being exposed to a lot of dust. Inhaling dust can lead to a condition called dust poisoning, which can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question pertains to a situation when someone is away from home and sleeping in a different location. Among the choices, hotels are likely to have fire safety measures in place and have fire exits on the first and second floors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that everyone crowded around the toilet during a break in an event, which suggests that the toilet is located in a place where many people gather. The options "restaurant," "stadium," and "mall" all have public restrooms and could potentially fit the context. However, the option "space shuttle" is unlikely since it is not a common place for people to take breaks, and there are typically only a few toilets on board. Therefore, the best answer is "bathroom."
feel close to | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the purpose of chatting with friends that you admire is to achieve a sense of closeness. This may be because feeling close to someone is often a desirable outcome of social interactions, especially with people that you admire and respect. Exchanging information and smiles, while important parts of conversation, may not necessarily be the main goal of chatting with someone you admire. Love and social approval are also not necessary or guaranteed outcomes of social interactions.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny had to seek food from someone else, which implies that there was another household nearby. The most likely place for him to have gone would be to a neighbor's house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest any external source of food.
chemistry lab | Knowledge: The sentence mentions chemicals and chemical burns, which suggests that the location where Sally and Joe were burned was likely a place where chemicals are used or stored. Options such as swimming pool and beach are unlikely to have chemicals that cause burns. Crystal meth lab is a possible location, but it is less likely given the specific mention of a chemistry lab. Laboratory is a broad term, but it is the most general option that could apply to different types of chemical labs.
total domination | Knowledge: The word "conquer" suggests a complete victory over the opponent, making "total domination" the most fitting option. The other options may indicate success but do not necessarily convey the same sense of complete control over the opponent.
see like | Knowledge: The word "observe" in the sentence suggests that the friends are looking at something together, and the phrase "at the same time" suggests that they are seeing the same thing. The phrase "see like" implies that they are seeing in a similar way, as in having a similar perception or interpretation of what they are observing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
nausea | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John didn't enjoy eating the hamburger and that it had a negative effect on him. The word "nausea" means feeling queasy, which is a common side effect of eating something that doesn't agree with you. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
rest area | Knowledge: Rest areas are places on highways or roads where drivers can stop to rest or use the restroom. They often have parking spaces and amenities such as vending machines, picnic tables, and restrooms. Therefore, a group of travellers who are travelling by road are likely to stop at a rest area for a break. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they are related to other modes of transportation such as train stations and airports.
human | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Steve used his diaphragm, which is a muscle located in the human body. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
castle | Knowledge: Castles are known for their large wooden doors, which were often reinforced with iron or other sturdy materials to protect against invaders. While some homes may have large wooden doors, it is less common than in castles. Airports and skyscrapers typically have automatic sliding doors or revolving doors made of glass or metal, and not wooden doors. "Every building" is too broad of a category and cannot be inferred from the question.
bar | Knowledge: The question suggests that the animals mentioned are in a setting where they can enjoy a drink, which is most likely a bar environment. The other options do not make sense in this context. The African continent is a large area and does not provide any specific setting for the animals mentioned. The Amazon basin is a rainforest and not a place where animals would go to enjoy a drink. A research laboratory or friend's house would not typically have monkeys, elephants, or zebras.
fly | Knowledge: The description of John seeing an insect using its legs and Mary seeing insects using their wings both suggest that the insects were in motion, which might lead the reader to consider "move" or "fly" as possible answers. However, the mention of wings specifically points more strongly to "fly" as the correct answer. "Buzz" and "sense vibrations" don't seem to fit with the context of the sentence, and while insects certainly eat, that doesn't seem to be what's being described here.
go to bed early | Knowledge: Getting up early requires going to bed early as well so that the body can have enough rest and energy for the day ahead. Fixing an alarm can only remind a person to wake up, but it does not guarantee that they will have the energy to start their day. "Go sleep early" is not a grammatically correct option, and "dawn" is not a practical solution as it is not an action that a person can take. Asking a spouse to wake a person up can put unnecessary pressure on the spouse and may not be reliable. Therefore, the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early is to go to bed early.
classroom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is attending a lecture or presentation, specifically one about advanced theoretical physics. Therefore, the most likely location for needing a pencil would be in a classroom or lecture hall. The other options, such as desk drawer or home, do not fit the context since the person is not likely to have those locations accessible during a lecture. Pocket could be a reasonable option, but it is less likely since the sentence mentions the need for a pencil specifically, which may not always be carried in a pocket.
fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that expressing oneself through art, music, and other hobbies can be enjoyable, which is commonly associated with "fun". The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as "fight", "communication", "understood", and "suffering" do not necessarily apply to expressing oneself through hobbies.
park | Knowledge: Parks are often known for having different types of birds due to the availability of food sources, such as bird feeders, and the presence of trees and bushes for shelter. Forests may also have a variety of birds, but the context of the question suggests a more urban setting, making park the most likely option. Stores and air have no clear connection to the context, whereas countryside may have birds, but the question suggests a specific location.
adequate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the living conditions in the building were not great, but it also suggests that the building did meet minimum standards for habitation. The word "barely" indicates that the building met only the most basic requirements for safety and functionality. The word "adequate" means sufficient for a given purpose or need, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options either contradict the context of the sentence or are irrelevant.
delaware or connecticut | Knowledge: The sentence implies that toll roads are not situated near the Pacific Ocean on a specific coast. The options that mention the Eastern United States or Good Repair are too broad or vague to provide a clear answer. Delaware and Connecticut are the only two options that specifically mention a coastal state that is not on the Pacific Ocean, so one of those two states is likely the correct answer.
hardware store | Knowledge: This question is asking about the proper location to put tin after purchasing it. Tin is a useful material that is often used in construction and household repairs, so it is likely to be found in hardware stores. The other choices don't make sense in the context of the question. An antique store would not sell new tin, and it would not be useful to put tin in a shopping bag or landfill. A shed could be a possibility if it is being stored for future use, but a hardware store is the most appropriate location after purchase.
department store | Knowledge: The items listed in the question are commonly found in a department store, which typically sells a wide variety of products under one roof. A backpack, house, and table are not typically sold together in the same location, and a mall usually has individual stores rather than a singular department store.
toy store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a place to buy toys for their kids to play with. Disneyland and the jungle are not typically associated with buying toys, while a swimming pool is a place to swim rather than buy toys. Home is also an unlikely option as the sentence implies that the speaker wants to take their kids somewhere to buy toys. A toy store is therefore the correct answer as it is the most logical choice for buying toys.
four legs | Knowledge: The phrase "a man's best friend" is commonly used to refer to dogs, who are known for their loyalty and companionship to humans. The characteristic that differentiates dogs from the other options in the choices is that they have four legs, which is a defining characteristic of dogs and many other animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
exhilaration | Knowledge: Based on the context of the sentence, the person climbing the mountain is likely to experience a rush of excitement or adrenaline due to the physical activity and exposure to fresh air. Exhilaration means feeling a sense of excitement or thrill, which fits with the situation described in the sentence. The other options may also be associated with climbing a mountain, but do not capture the specific feeling of excitement and energy that is implied.
frustration | Knowledge: The word "unsuccessful" suggests that the writing program did not achieve its intended purpose, which is likely to cause frustration for the user. Bugs and unexpected results are possible consequences of an unsuccessful program, but they do not necessarily relate directly to the user's experience of frustration. Satisfaction and aggravation are unlikely outcomes of a program that did not work as intended.
orchestra | Knowledge: The term "pit" commonly refers to the area in front of a stage where the orchestra is situated. It is where musicians play music for plays, operas, and musicals that require live instrumental accompaniment. Flutes are commonly used in orchestras, which makes it likely that they can be found in a pit. The other answer choices do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
brains | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone is called stupid, it may mean they have a lack of intelligence or mental capacity. The term "no brains" is often used as a derogatory expression to mean someone lacks intellect or common sense. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
apartment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus is a plant that can potentially dirty carpets, which makes it an indoor plant. Among the options, only "apartment" is a type of location where it would make sense to have an indoor plant. The other options do not offer any clear clue as to where the ficus would be placed inside a building.
surrounded | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person felt alone despite being in a class with other people. The word "even" implies that there are many people around her, but she still felt isolated. Therefore, the correct answer is "surrounded," as it suggests that there are people around her, but she still feels alone. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
wall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of making a hole with one's fist is associated with a solid surface that can be punched through. Swiss cheese and golf courses do not have solid surfaces that someone could make a hole in with their fist. A football ground or plain ground could potentially have a solid surface, but it is not specifically mentioned in the sentence. A wall, however, is a solid surface that someone could make a hole in with their fist.
country club | Knowledge: Red clay tennis courts are typically found in country clubs, as they are expensive to maintain and require a great deal of care. Wimbledon is known for its grass court, while New York hosts the US Open on hard courts, and town and health clubs may have a variety of surfaces, but red clay is not commonly found outside of country clubs.
sit down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is already standing or walking, and their legs are tired. Sleeping or going to bed are not appropriate options as they are not practical in the moment. Running would only make the situation worse. Closing eyes is not mentioned in the context of the sentence and cannot be assumed to be a solution to tired legs. Sitting down is the most appropriate option as it will allow the person to rest their legs and take a break from standing or walking.
becoming tired | Knowledge: The sentence implies that playing tennis all day results in a physical activity that causes exhaustion. Tennis is a sport that involves a lot of movement and exertion, so it is likely that most people would feel tired after playing for an extended period. The other options do not address the physical toll that playing tennis all day would have on a person's body.
all of the above | Knowledge: The question is asking for a common location where TVs are used to display sports. All of the answer choices are common locations where people watch sports on TV. A restaurant may have a TV in the bar or dining area, a living room or apartment may have a TV for personal use, and a bar may have multiple TVs for patrons to watch different games. While "house" is a general term, it is still a common location where TVs are used to display sports.
drink | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animals understood the importance of fluids, which implies that they knew when to drink and how to avoid potentially harmful substances. The other options (feel pain, bite, fly, gay) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
eat breakfast | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person who stayed over after having sex with the man woke up in his house the next morning. The man got up early to do something, which suggests that it was morning and he was starting his day. The most logical thing for someone to do in the morning is to eat breakfast, so it can be inferred that the man made breakfast for the person who spent the night. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
ominous | Knowledge: The fact that the king was assassinated in the middle of his speech suggests that the day was not actually auspicious as he had claimed. The word "ominous" is often used to describe events that are foreboding or foreshadowing something negative or dangerous, so it is the most appropriate option. The other choices do not accurately reflect the situation and therefore do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
drinking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a common act of consumption that people engage in while having food, which indicates that the answer should be related to food or beverages. Of the choices given, drinking is the only one that fits this description. The other options are either unrelated or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
drink alcohol | Knowledge: The question implies that someone experiencing stress may do something to excess, and the options given suggest possible behaviors. While cleaning or dreaming excessively might be possible, the use of drugs or alcohol is a common coping mechanism for people experiencing stress. The specific mention of "drink alcohol" in the options reinforces this answer as the likely choice.
root cellar | Knowledge: After a potato is done growing, it needs to be stored in a cool, dark, and humid place to prevent it from sprouting or rotting. A root cellar is a traditional storage area in many homes and farms that provides these ideal conditions for potato storage. The other options, such as "own kitchen," "clam chowder," "desk drawer," and "kitchen cabinet," do not provide the necessary conditions for potato storage and are therefore not the correct answer.
travel abroad | Knowledge: The other options do not have any clear connection with gaining new perspectives. However, traveling to a new place offers the opportunity to experience different cultures, environments, and ways of thinking that can broaden one's worldview and provide new insights and perspectives. This makes "travel abroad" the correct answer to the question.
anguish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family members are crying, which is a common expression of strong emotion such as sadness, grief, and anguish. The context of the sentence involves murder, which is a violent and traumatic experience that can cause great emotional pain and suffering. The other options, except for "terrible," which is a vague adjective that does not clearly indicate an emotion or feeling, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Remorse" refers to a feeling of guilt or regret, "retaliation" refers to taking revenge or seeking justice, and "wet" is a physical sensation that does not relate to the emotional state of the family members.
cinema | Knowledge: Seats are commonly used in cinemas to watch movies. While movies could arguably be a correct answer, it is less specific and could refer to watching at home, whereas cinema specifically refers to a place where movies are shown to an audience in a theater-like setting. Hockey games, theaters, and operas also have seating arrangements for audiences but they are not typically associated with watching movies.
various situations | Knowledge: The term "omnidisciplinarian" suggests that John is knowledgeable and skilled in multiple fields or disciplines. Therefore, he may be able to adapt and find success in various situations that require expertise in different areas. The other options, such as ocean or awards ceremony, do not have any direct correlation with John's abilities as an omnidisciplinarian.
open | Knowledge: The sentence describes a situation in which a door is closed, which implies that the action required to go through the door is to open it. The other options do not provide a feasible solution for going through a closed door. "Keep people out" suggests preventing others from entering, "enclose cupboard" suggests placing something inside a confined space, "teleport" is a fictional concept that is not possible in reality, and "glass" is a material used for windows and barriers but does not relate to going through a door.
zoo | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the child is looking at pictures of animals and hearing rhymes from his mom, suggesting that they are likely at a place where there are many different animals to see. The word "favorite" also indicates that the child is choosing from a selection of options, further suggesting that they are at a zoo with a variety of animal exhibits. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mop | Knowledge: Wet cleaning a floor requires a tool that can absorb water and clean up dirt and grime, such as a mop. A fan and energy are not cleaning tools, and vacuuming is typically used for dry cleaning of floors. A broom is also not suitable for wet cleaning as it will just spread the water and dirt around.
rainy | Knowledge: The word "beautiful" suggests that the lightning strikes are not viewed as dangerous or destructive. Rainy days are often associated with thunderstorms and lightning, making it the most likely choice. November and average days do not have any specific weather associations or characteristics that suggest beautiful lightning strikes, making them unlikely options. Dull and wet are both negative adjectives and do not fit with the positive connotation of "beautiful."
sleep at night | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that drinking alcohol can have a negative impact on a specific activity or function. The word "lose" further implies that this activity or function may be impaired or hindered by alcohol. Since the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of alcohol, we can eliminate them. The remaining option, "sleep at night," is a common problem associated with alcohol consumption and is often cited as a reason to limit or avoid drinking.
fireworks display | Knowledge: Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks displays as a way to celebrate the national holiday. Groundhogs and construction sites are not typically associated with Independence Day, and landmines and army may have negative connotations that do not relate to the celebratory nature of the holiday.
closet | Knowledge: In many hotel rooms, clothes storage is provided in a closet, which is a built-in or standalone structure that features a hanging rod and/or shelves. A drawer, which is a compartment that slides in and out of a piece of furniture, is more likely to contain smaller items such as socks and undergarments, but may also hold shirts. Garderobe is a less common term that refers to a room or space for storing or hanging clothing, but is not typically used in hotel contexts. A shelf can be used for storage, but isn't typically a primary option for clothing in hotel rooms. A suitcase is generally used for transporting clothing, rather than storing it in a hotel room.
stopping to think | Knowledge: The question is asking about a strategy to ensure that one is remembering something, which suggests that the other options are unlikely to be effective. Closing one's eyes and answering a question are not necessarily related to memory, while "bad time" and "forgetting" are not strategies at all. "Stopping to think" is a common technique for recalling information, as it allows one to focus their attention and retrieve relevant details from their memory.
bar | Knowledge: Bars are commonly associated with serving alcoholic beverages, while vending machines, bottles, refrigerators, and hockey games do not necessarily have any connection to alcohol consumption. While some venues, like hockey games, may offer beer for sale, they are not solely focused on serving alcohol in the same way that bars are.
remorse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has killed people in a state of anger or fury, which commonly leads to feelings of guilt or regret after the violent act is committed. Remorse, which means deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed, is the most appropriate choice among the options considering the context of the sentence. Stomach ache and retaliation do not make logical sense in this context, while sadness is not a strong enough emotion to describe the severity of the situation. Going to jail is a consequence of the action and not a feeling.
fast food restaurant | Knowledge: The question suggests that someone or something may be using too much salt, and the options given each represent a possible culprit. A shaker or kitchen cupboard may be used by individuals who have control over the amount of salt they add to their food, making it unlikely that they would use too much. "People" is too broad and does not provide specific information. A table is an inanimate object and cannot use salt. A fast food restaurant, however, is known for using high amounts of salt in their food to enhance flavor and preserve freshness, making it the most likely answer.
smiling | Knowledge: The question suggests that the friendly man did something specific to show that he was happy when meeting new people. Out of the given choices, the act of smiling is most commonly associated with expressing happiness and friendliness when meeting someone new. While saying hello, starting a conversation, and shaking hands are all common social interactions, they do not necessarily indicate happiness on their own. Introducing oneself is also a common social norm, but it does not necessarily suggest a person's level of happiness.
west | Knowledge: The sun sets in the west, which is a well-known fact based on the direction of the earth's rotation and the position of the sun in relation to the horizon. The other options, such as outer space and beans, are irrelevant and do not provide any helpful information.
broken bones | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is related to injuries sustained in a skiing accident, and broken bones are a common injury in such accidents. Frost bite and chapped lips are possible consequences of prolonged exposure to cold weather, but they may not necessarily be present in multiple places. A healthy body is not an injury, and broken legs are not necessarily present in more than one place.
disregard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite John's efforts to care for Kate, she repeatedly put herself in danger. The word that fits best in the blank should convey a lack of concern for her own safety, which is indicated by the fact that she kept putting herself in harm's way. The options "neglect" and "apathetic" also convey a lack of care, but "disregard" is a better fit in the context of the sentence. The options "unfeeling" and "indifferent" do not necessarily imply a lack of concern for safety, and so are not the best choices.
disposed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the agent of change has a negative feeling towards the king and is planning to do something to him. "Disposed" means to get rid of something or someone, which fits the context of the sentence indicating that the agent of change is planning to get rid of the king. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
university | Knowledge: The phrase "achieve learning as an adult" implies that the poet is seeking higher education or advanced learning opportunities. While it's possible to learn outside of a university setting, the other options given (classroom, English class, book store, and home) do not necessarily suggest a formal, structured environment suited for adult learners. Additionally, universities are well-known for offering a variety of programs and courses that can accommodate different interests and goals.
cupboard | Knowledge: Kitchen towels are commonly used in the kitchen for a variety of purposes such as drying dishes and wiping countertops. Therefore, it is more likely that it would be found in a location that is easily accessible from the kitchen, such as a cupboard or a drawer. The other options, such as hotel, linen closet, under a rock, or locker room, do not have any direct relevance to the context of the question.
polite | Knowledge: The use of "sir" or "ma'am" after answering a question is a common sign of respect and formality, suggesting that the speaker is being courteous and well-mannered. The other options (irritation, correct, responding, sadness) do not align with this type of behavior and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
punch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Matt had difficulty controlling his anger, which implies that he may have had a physical reaction when someone triggered him. Punching someone is a common physical response when someone is angry and feels out of control. The other options do not align with this context - destroying an enemy, writing letters, and illustrating points are all more strategic or intellectual responses rather than physical ones. Cooling off is a more neutral option, but it doesn't necessarily suggest any action or behavior on Matt's part.
compete | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people are doing the same thing, they tend to compete. Competing is a common behavior when two people are competing for the same thing or working towards the same goal. The other options, such as helping or giving orders, do not fit the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy enjoyed going to the party because he liked to mix and have a good time. The other options, such as planning or meeting new people, are not mentioned in the context of the sentence and do not seem to be related to Billy's enjoyment of the party. Getting drunk is a possibility, but it is not the only way to have fun at a party, and the sentence does not specifically mention drinking as the reason for Billy's enjoyment. The watusi is a type of dance and is not related to the context of the sentence.
auditorium | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the couple entered their "prom," which is a school dance typically held indoors. The options "movie theaters," "end of line," "football field," and "opera house" are all outdoor venues or places that do not typically host school dances. "Auditorium" is the most fitting option as it is commonly used as a venue for school events such as dances, concerts, and theater performances.
keep walking | Knowledge: The phrase "wanted no trouble" suggests that the person wants to avoid confrontation and conflict, so the best course of action would be to keep walking and not engage with the bully. Choosing to step up or be courageous could escalate the situation and put the person at risk of physical or verbal harm. Crossing the street may be a good option if it allows the person to avoid the situation altogether, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Doing nothing is not a desirable option, but it may be the safest choice for someone who wants to avoid trouble.
conventional | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hipsters took a disingenuous and kooky approach to their cafe, which implies that they were trying to be different or unique in a forced or insincere way. This approach may have alienated potential customers or made it difficult for them to understand what the cafe was all about. The sentence also suggests that the competitor took a different approach that allowed them to succeed, and since the other choices all suggest some form of alignment with the hipster approach, the correct answer is conventional, which suggests a more straightforward and traditional approach that is more likely to appeal to a wider range of customers.
desk drawer | Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to store a ballpoint pen, which implies that it is a long-term storage location rather than a temporary one. The other answer choices don't seem like logical locations for long-term storage of a pen. A pocket could lead to loss or damage, a stationery store is where one would buy the pen, a backpack is a transportation method, and a bank has no clear connection to pen storage. Therefore, a desk drawer, where one would store office supplies, seems to be the most appropriate choice.
end of line | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cutting in line at the ticket office is unacceptable and may result in a punishment. The phrase "end of line" is often used as a warning to those who try to cut in line and suggests that they will be sent to the back. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
working hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that success is achieved through preparation and some other factor, which is likely to be related to putting in effort or hard work. Working hard is a commonly recognized factor in success, and is also a general term that can apply to any field or situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are not commonly recognized as factors in success.
office building, house, warm climates | Knowledge: Air conditioning is commonly used in professional spaces like office buildings to maintain a comfortable temperature for workers. It is also commonly used in residential homes like houses, especially in areas with warm climates where temperatures can become uncomfortable. The other options, such as Texas and humid, do not necessarily suggest that an air conditioner would be present.
existing | Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of the key to happiness while living life. The sentence suggests that simply existing is not enough to achieve happiness, implying that one must do more than just exist. The other options (happiness, early death, acquiring knowledge, being idle) do not provide a clear opposite to the key to happiness.
buy groceries | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to purchase something before they can cook dinner. This implies that they do not have the ingredients they need, so they must go out and buy them. The option "buy a kitchen" is unlikely, as it does not make sense to buy a new kitchen in order to cook dinner. The option "hungry" is incorrect, as it is unlikely that someone would need to be hungry to cook dinner. The options "buy food" and "eat food" are also incorrect, as they suggest that the person already has food but must either purchase or consume it.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence implies that ending a marriage can have both negative and positive consequences, and in this case, the positive consequence is suggested to be relief. Relief can be a common feeling after a difficult and unhappy marriage ends. The other options, such as grief, confusion, depression, and happiness, may also be associated with ending a marriage, but they do not align with the specific idea of relief that is suggested in this sentence.
sing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoys hearing Jenny do something and that they often spend time together and get home late, which implies that they may be doing activities that involve some form of entertainment or leisure. "Tell story" or "jump rope" do not fit the context of the sentence, and "clean room" seems unlikely to be an activity that James enjoys hearing. "Going out at night" is also unlikely since the sentence states that they already spend a lot of time together. Therefore, "sing" is the most logical choice as it is an activity that can be entertaining and enjoyable and does not conflict with the information provided in the sentence.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after getting money from a bank, the next location would be one where household items and food can be purchased. A grocery store is the most likely option as it offers a wide variety of food and household essentials. The other options (city, financial center, main street, salon) do not necessarily have anything to do with purchasing household items and food.
peaceful sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being free from guilt can have a positive effect on a person's well-being. Guilt can create feelings of anxiety and unrest, which may impact a person's ability to sleep peacefully. Therefore, it is likely that if someone is free from guilt, they are more likely to achieve peaceful sleep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
love | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Danny has not fully experienced what it means to be human, which suggests that he may be missing an emotional or interpersonal element. The option "love" fits this description, as it is a fundamental human emotion that is often seen as a defining characteristic of the human experience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
agree with each other | Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes when two people have the same point of view. "Agree with each other" is the only option that directly reflects this meaning. "Make love" and "when they hug" are unrelated to having the same point of view, while "shake hands" and "work together" may indicate a level of cooperation, but not necessarily a shared perspective.
cramps | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a negative outcome that could happen after only a short amount of time hiking. Cramps are a common affliction that can occur due to strenuous physical activity, so they would be a likely answer in this context. Adventure and smiling suggest positive outcomes, which do not fit the negative tone of the sentence. Sweating is a natural occurrence during exercise and wouldn't necessarily be a negative outcome. Giving up would be an extreme answer that doesn't fit the context unless more information is provided.
bus stop | Knowledge: The question suggests that people are waiting for a ride across town, which is most commonly associated with public transportation. A bus stop is a specific location where people gather to catch a bus, taxi or other forms of public transportation. The other options, such as a wedding, convention, pool or apartment, do not have any clear connection to people waiting for transportation across town.
real estate | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person wants to make money by selling houses, which is a key area of focus within the field of real estate. Studying real estate will provide the person with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the market, understand property values, and negotiate deals. The other options listed are not directly related to the real estate industry and would not provide the necessary knowledge to sell houses.
skin irritation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman had a compulsive habit of washing her hands excessively, which would likely lead to skin irritation. Repeated washing can strip the skin of its natural oils and cause redness, itching, or even cracking. The other options do not seem like likely consequences of this behavior.
say mass | Knowledge: Priests are commonly associated with performing religious rituals or ceremonies, such as saying mass or baptising individuals. The context of the sentence suggests that the priest is in front of a gathering of people, which may indicate that he is performing a public ceremony. The other options, such as drinking coffee or being on trial, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
listen to radio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity must involve sound but not require movement of the mouth while driving to work. Anger and speed are not activities that involve sound, while singing requires movement of the mouth. A statue is a stationary object and not an activity. Therefore, the correct answer is listening to the radio, as it involves hearing sounds but does not require movement of the mouth.
rainforest | Knowledge: A marmoset is a type of primate that is native to the rainforests of South America. They are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time in trees, and are known for their agile and acrobatic movements. Therefore, the best answer would be rainforest as it aligns with the natural habitat of marmosets. The other options - kitchen, wilderness, dictionary, and burrow - do not fit with the expected environment for a marmoset.
monarchy | Knowledge: A monarchy is a form of government where a king or queen serves as the head of state. The term "kingdom" suggests a country or territory that is ruled by a monarch, making monarchy the most closely associated form of government. "Ruled by government" is too broad and could apply to various forms of government, while "Europe" is a continent and not a form of government. "Book" is not related to the question at all.
contempt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Manny did not show respect to the court, which would be considered disrespectful and disobedient behavior. The term "contempt" specifically refers to actions that show disrespect or disregard for the authority of a court or similar institution. The other options, such as dishonor or humiliate, do not accurately reflect the legal consequences of disrespecting a court.
tropics | Knowledge: The mention of a storm suggests that the question is about a region that is prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes or cyclones. The options "summer" and "weather report" do not refer to a specific geographical region. "Blue shield" is the name of a health insurance company and is therefore not relevant to the question. "America" is too broad and does not describe a specific storm-prone area. This leaves "tropics" as the most logical choice, as this region is known for experiencing frequent and intense tropical storms. Additionally, the Red Cross is known for its humanitarian efforts in response to natural disasters in tropical regions.
civil service | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the man was convicted of a crime related to his lack of motivation or effort, which may imply that he may have been employed in a job that requires him to be active and productive, such as a civil servant. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
chair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were actively trying to make themselves comfortable by sitting down, which implies the use of some type of seating. The option "legs" is incorrect because it is not something that is required for sitting down comfortably. "Laziness" is not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Floor" is incorrect because it is not necessarily comfortable to sit on the floor. "Sit on" is also incorrect because it is not a specific object or item that can provide comfort.
get tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog has a lot of energy and enjoys chasing after a ball repeatedly. The phrase "over and over" implies that the dog does this for a long period of time, suggesting that eventually, it will become tired. The other options, such as "ball stopped" and "fall and hurt yourself," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Breathing" is a natural process and doesn't have any clear connection to the dog's activity, while "catching" is already implied in the first part of the sentence (i.e. the dog loves to run after the ball).
park | Knowledge: Parks are commonly associated with relaxation and leisure activities, such as picnics, walks, and spending time in nature. In contrast, workplaces, war zones, and jails are typically associated with stress, danger, and confinement, which are not conducive to relaxation. While churches may promote a sense of peace and calmness, they are primarily intended for religious worship and may not necessarily be a place for relaxation.
school | Knowledge: The word "standing" suggests that the people are not sitting, lying down, or moving around, but rather they are stationary in one location. This makes it unlikely that a supermarket or street corner would contain many people standing inside, as these are places where people are typically walking or moving around. "Public place" is too broad of a term to determine if it would contain standing people, and "space shuttle" is an unlikely option as it is a small and confined space. A school, on the other hand, often has large groups of students standing in classrooms or other common areas, making it the most probable option.
move mountains | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that large amounts of water can cause significant changes over an extended period of time. Mountains are known to be shaped by the erosive forces of water, which is why the option "move mountains" is the most appropriate choice. The other options, such as "room temperature" or "thin blood," do not fit with the context or the scientific knowledge of the effects of water over time.
having sex | Knowledge: The question implies that going to a party with the opposite sex can have certain consequences, and the choices suggest different possibilities. Out of those options, having sex is most commonly associated with parties where alcohol is consumed and people are in close proximity to each other. While it is possible to meet new people, drink beer, and enjoy oneself at a party, those options do not necessarily lead to the same consequences as going to a party with the opposite sex.
zoo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children are going somewhere to see different animals. The most common place to see a variety of animals in one location is at a zoo. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. School is where children go to learn, soccer and cricket stadiums are for playing sports, and Disneyland is a theme park focused on entertainment, not animals.
pleasure / feeling good | Knowledge: The context suggests that the focus is on the emotions and feelings experienced while giving assistance. Death and trouble are negative emotions and do not fit in this context. Happiness is a positive emotion, but it may not always be the case when giving assistance. Pleasure and feeling good are more general terms that can encompass a range of positive feelings, such as a sense of fulfillment, satisfaction, or altruism.
farming community | Knowledge: The description of multiple farmhouses close together suggests that this place is likely a farming community, where agriculture and farming are central to the local economy and way of life. The other options do not fit the description of the setting provided.
gods | Knowledge: The name "Zeus" is commonly associated with Greek mythology, which is populated by a pantheon of gods and goddesses. The sentence suggests that Zeus was a member of this group of deities, as opposed to being a boy, female or lady. The term "feminist" does not apply to mythological figures in this way, and is therefore an unlikely choice for the correct answer.
misunderstanding | Knowledge: The question asks for a reason to stop chatting with friends, and one of the options is misunderstanding. This suggests that there may have been a disagreement or miscommunication that caused discomfort or tension in the conversation. Learning about, meeting, laughter, and silliness do not necessarily involve a negative experience that would cause someone to stop chatting with friends.
good at | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that one of the friends always won when they played cards. This implies that the particular friend was skilled at playing cards, which is often described using the phrase "good at." The other options do not provide a satisfactory explanation for why the friend always won.
feel guilty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John has a negative emotional response to lying. Feeling guilty is a common psychological response to dishonesty, as it goes against moral values and ethics. Avoiding eye contact and blushing may also be associated with lying, but they are not necessarily correlated with the particular emotional response of guilt. Turning purple and falling asleep are not logical or expected outcomes of lying.
aggression | Knowledge: Aggression is typically associated with a competitive mindset and can give an individual an advantage in a competitive situation. Stress and defeat are typically negative emotions that can hinder performance, while anger may cloud judgment and detract from focus. "Pumped" is a less specific term and may not necessarily be useful in a competitive situation.
south | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location of the dance club is related to the side that won the Civil War. The side that won the Civil War was the Union, which was primarily made up of Northern states. Therefore, the option furthest in the same direction as the side that won the Civil War would be a Southern location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
board vessels | Knowledge: The Coast Guard is a branch of the United States Armed Forces that is responsible for maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, and environmental protection. One of their primary duties is to board vessels to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, such as ensuring proper safety equipment is on board, verifying proper documentation and licenses, and checking for illegal activities such as drug trafficking or smuggling. The other options do not accurately describe the primary duties of the Coast Guard, which focus on maintaining safety and security on the water.
breathe air | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when you are swimming underwater, you need to come up to the surface to do something specific. Specifically, you need to do something related to breathing, which suggests that "breathe air" is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
theatre | Knowledge: A well-dressed person visiting a box office suggests that they are going to attend a formal event. The options of "fox theater" or "theatre district" indicate locations that are known for hosting theatrical performances, and therefore are likely a correct answer. The option of "ballpark" would not require formal attire, and "counseling" has no connection to attending a formal event.
freedom | Knowledge: Divorce often represents the end of a relationship that may have been confining or unhappy, so the person who is getting divorced may feel a sense of liberation or freedom. This can manifest in different ways, such as being able to pursue new romantic relationships, travel more, or make other life changes. The other options are negative outcomes that are not usually associated with divorce, or at least not exclusively so.
confusion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the chief of police was trying to answer questions quickly to avoid something negative happening. In this case, the negative outcome may be confusion on the part of the person asking the questions. By answering quickly, the chief is trying to provide clear and concise answers that will avoid any confusion or misunderstandings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
in competition | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about what you compete against someone in, which indicates that there is a specific event or activity being referred to. "Fair" and "false start" are not things that you compete against someone in. "Competitive" is an adjective that describes the nature of the activity, rather than the actual event being competed in. "Practice" is a way to prepare for a competition, but it is not the competition itself. Therefore, "in competition" is the most appropriate answer.
street corner | Knowledge: A corner shop is typically a small retail store located at the corner of a street, and it is commonly associated with selling a variety of goods, including hats. Therefore, the answer that is most likely, and is even specified in the question, is street corner. The other options such as subway, town, and Minnesota do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. England, while known for its fashion and hats, is not specifically mentioned in the sentence as being the location of the corner shop.
new perspectives | Knowledge: The question suggests that the key to doing things in a new way is to change the way one thinks about the task at hand. This implies that new perspectives are necessary to generate new ideas and approaches. Knowledge and sense might be helpful in some cases, but they don't necessarily lead to new ways of doing things. "Best way" and "figure out" both imply using existing methods or knowledge to solve a problem, which doesn't necessarily lead to innovation or creativity.
oven | Knowledge: The other options listed do not make sense in the context of the question. A fridge and cupboard are used for storage, a field is where food is grown, and a table is where food is served. An oven, on the other hand, is commonly used to heat up food and is a common appliance found in kitchens for this purpose.
run | Knowledge: The word "hurry" suggests that the children are trying to complete a task quickly. "Run" is a verb commonly associated with moving quickly or with urgency, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not accurately describe actions someone might take when in a hurry.
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running twenty six miles could have a dangerous consequence for someone with an underlying heart condition. Death is a severe but possible outcome in such a case. Tiredness and exhaustion may be expected outcomes for anyone who runs a marathon, but the sentence specifies an underlying heart condition, which indicates that the risks are higher for this person. Passing out and heartbreak are not relevant to the question's context.
hardware store  | Knowledge: Tin is a metal commonly used for making various household items like kitchenware and cans. As such, it is not likely to be found in a cupboard or grocery store. An antique store may have vintage tin items, but it is not a reliable source for acquiring the raw material. The best option for obtaining tin would be a hardware store where metals and tools are sold.
get in shape | Knowledge: Going to the gym is often associated with exercising and improving one's physical fitness. Therefore, the most logical reason someone would start playing sports at the gym is to get in shape. This may involve a variety of activities, including strength training, cardio, and sports. The other options - practice, compete, have fun, and stretch - are all possible reasons why someone might play sports at the gym, but they are less directly related to the goal of improving physical fitness.
spare time | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being described has no obligations or responsibilities, which would free up their time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "spare time." The other options do not make sense in the sentence context.
sleep | Knowledge: The phrase "at the end of the day" usually refers to the time when a person is finished with their daily activities and ready to rest or sleep. The other options do not fit this context: "make money" suggests work, "cross street" suggests movement, "draw attention to themselves" suggests something attention-grabbing, and "come home" suggests going back to a specific location.
applied | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the work is purely theoretical or abstract, and therefore not applicable to practical situations. "Applied" is the opposite of theoretical or abstract, and it means that a theory or concept is used in practical situations. The other options, such as "contaminated" or "corrupt," have negative connotations that do not fit the context of the sentence.
cleaning house | Knowledge: The term "maid" typically refers to a person who is hired to clean and maintain a household. The phrase "start her work" implies that the maid is beginning her shift or starting to clean for the day. Out of the five options, "cleaning house" is the most general and inclusive, as it could refer to cleaning any room or area of the house. The other options are more specific and do not account for all the areas that a maid might clean, such as the kitchen or living room.
lunch box | Knowledge: The sentence refers to "kids in elementary school," suggesting that the context is related to school lunches or snacks. Grapes are a common and healthy snack for kids, often packed in their lunch boxes by parents or caregivers. The other options (kitchen, wine country, fridge, food store) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would be unlikely places for elementary school kids to keep grapes.
law suits | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man is seeking representation for arbitration, which implies that a legal dispute is involved. The professional is providing assistance to avoid a potential negative outcome, and the most common negative outcome of a legal dispute is a lawsuit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
entertainment | Knowledge: Baseball games are a popular form of entertainment for many people, as they often provide an exciting and enjoyable experience. People may attend games to socialize with friends and family, cheer on their favorite team or player, or simply to enjoy the atmosphere and energy of the event. The other options (pain, stupid) do not align with the positive connotations typically associated with attending a baseball game, while delight and fun are similar in meaning to entertainment but not as commonly used in this context.
frenzied | Knowledge: The use of the word "completely" suggests that the wife's emotions were intense and extreme. "Frenzied" is a stronger word than the other options and implies a loss of control or chaotic behavior, which would make it harder for the husband to remain calm. The other options suggest varying levels of discomfort or distress but not necessarily overwhelming emotions.
houseplant | Knowledge: Cats are known for their instinctive behavior to cover their waste, and they may seek out a similar substrate to their litter box when it is full. Houseplants may be attractive to cats as they offer a similar texture to a litter box, and the soil may absorb urine. The other options such as the bathtub, dumpsters, and the floor do not have a close association with a cat's toileting behavior.
refrigerator | Knowledge: Cheese is a perishable dairy product that can spoil quickly if not stored properly. Refrigerators are known for keeping food fresh for longer periods of time as they slow down the growth of bacteria that can cause spoilage. Therefore, it is logical to assume that cheese would be stored in a refrigerator to maintain its freshness. The other options do not relate to the storage of cheese.
build houses | Knowledge: Construction workers are known for their work in building structures such as houses, buildings, and other infrastructure. They use a variety of tools and techniques to construct these structures, and their work is an essential part of many industries. The other options do not have any relation to the profession of construction workers.
Canada | Knowledge: The question implies that an expressway is leaving the US, which suggests that it is crossing a border. Among the options, only Canada is a neighboring country to the US and therefore the most likely destination for an expressway leaving the US. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
voices | Knowledge: The question is asking about the specific element that is required when creating art that involves singing. It is reasonable to assume that for singing to be a part of the art, the human voice is necessary. The other options do not necessarily relate to singing and art in the same way that voices do. Communication may be necessary for any type of art, while enlightenment, pride, and controversy do not necessarily have a direct connection to singing as an art form.
library | Knowledge: A library is a collection of books and other resources for reading, learning, and research. Therefore, it is more likely to have a large volume of text than a smaller area such as a bookshelf or a set of books. A collection of books or books can have different sizes and numbers, so they may or may not contain a large amount of text.
witness | Knowledge: In a trial, a witness is someone who provides information and insight about a case. They may be called upon to testify or give testimony in order to provide evidence that supports one side or the other. The judge is a neutral third party who presides over the trial and makes rulings based on the evidence presented. While telling the truth is important for all parties involved, it is not a specific role in a trial.
gaining weight | Knowledge: Eating hamburgers too fast can cause a person to consume greater amounts of food without realizing it, which can contribute to weight gain. When a person eats quickly, they may not give their body sufficient time to register feelings of fullness and satisfaction, leading them to eat more than they need. Additionally, hamburgers are often high in calories and fat, which can contribute to weight gain over time. The other options listed may be potential consequences of eating too quickly or consuming unhealthy foods, but they do not directly relate to the question of what eating hamburgers too fast leads to.
look for | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about how to find new items, which suggests actively searching for them. 'Look for' is the option that most directly indicates searching or seeking out something, making it the most appropriate answer. 'Go to movies' is irrelevant to the context of trying to find new items, while 'open eyes' and 'have eyes open' are redundant since having one's eyes open is assumed for visual search. 'Ask' is not necessarily the best option, as it assumes that someone else has the information about the new items, rather than the ability to find them oneself.
music | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a generational divide when it comes to music, with each generation finding the next's music to be unappealing or incomprehensible. This suggests that the correct answer is "music." The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence.
at home | Knowledge: The sentence implies that soldiers who are not deployed have a location where they can eat their food. The military base is a possible option, but the sentence suggests that soldiers who are not deployed would not be on the base. The other options do not make logical sense. Therefore, the correct answer is at home, as soldiers who are not actively serving would typically eat their meals in their own home or at a designated dining facility on the military base.
celebrate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the work that was done was successful, and as a result, it was time to celebrate. The other options do not fit the context of a successful completion of work, and thus are not correct.
winch | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the steel cable could be used to pull the tugboat, which would require some kind of mechanism to generate the pulling force. A winch is a common tool for this purpose, as it allows for controlled pulling and releasing of the cable. The other choices (wrench, suspension bridge, factory, and ship) do not make sense in the context of pulling the tugboat with a steel cable.
having energy | Knowledge: Eating lunch provides the body with necessary nutrients and calories that can be converted into energy for the body to use. This is why many people feel a boost in energy after eating lunch. The other options, such as feeling full, sleepy, or experiencing drowsiness, are not always the desired outcomes of eating lunch.
metric | Knowledge: The question is asking about a system of measurement, and specifically mentions an inch measurement. The inch is part of the imperial system, which is used primarily in the United States. The other options include liquid measure, which refers to volume measurement, centimeter/centimetre, which is a unit of length in the metric system, and mile, which is a unit of distance in the imperial system. The correct answer must be a system of measurement that includes length and has a unit of measurement that can be converted to inches. The metric system is a logical choice because it is the standard system of measurement used internationally, and has a variety of units that include length measurements (such as the centimeter) that can be easily converted to inches.
think | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the team was able to communicate effectively because they were able to anticipate each other's thoughts. This implies that they were able to work together seamlessly and were in sync with one another. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence; sending an email or ringing up the president of Bermuda are not related to effective communication within a team.
closet | Knowledge: The question is asking where the president keeps his pajamas, which suggests that the answer is related to personal items or belongings. The option "white house" refers to the president's official residence and office, but it is unlikely that his personal items would be kept there. "Corporation", "country", and "government" are too broad and do not relate to personal belongings. "Closet" is the most logical answer as it is a place where people typically store their clothes and personal items.
gym | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is changing into athletic clothing, which typically implies that he is in a place where physical activity or exercise is taking place. The most likely option based on this clue is a gym, which is a facility dedicated to fitness and exercise. The other options do not have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
pay the bill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam enjoys going to restaurants, but there is a specific thing that he forgets to do. The options "make reservations," "polite," "prepared to pay," and "drinking wine" do not fit the context of the sentence. However, "pay the bill" is a common thing that people forget to do in restaurants, especially if they are used to someone else paying for them or if they are distracted by the food or conversation.
polite | Knowledge: The question is asking about the qualities or characteristics that a server needs in order to provide good service to customers. Being polite is a common trait associated with good customer service, as it involves treating customers with respect, showing good manners, and being attentive to their needs. The other choices do not necessarily relate to customer service or may even be irrelevant, such as having a driver's license or making money.
ironing board | Knowledge: Ironing boards are commonly used for ironing clothing and other fabrics after they have been ironed. The other options are not typical places to put something after ironing it. The house and kitchen are too broad and do not provide a specific location, while the linen closet and laundry room are places where clothing and linens are stored, not ironed.
in danger | Knowledge: The word "safe" implies that the basement is a safer location compared to somewhere else in the context of the sentence. However, the word "still" suggests that there is still some level of danger present despite being in the basement. The phrase "put them" indicates that they were exposed to danger caused by the weather, which makes "in danger" the most appropriate answer. The other options may be similar, but "in danger" is the most accurate and idiomatic choice.
heartburn | Knowledge: Eating large amounts of fatty and greasy foods, such as hamburgers, can lead to heartburn. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. This is a common side effect of overeating or eating foods that are difficult for the stomach to digest. Gas, being full, death, and food poisoning do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jazz band | Knowledge: The sentence states that John plays brass instruments in a band that has a diverse group of people and many different instruments. This suggests that the band plays a type of music that incorporates a variety of instruments and styles, which is characteristic of jazz music. Additionally, the fact that they mostly play at clubs further supports the idea that they are a jazz band, as jazz music is often associated with small club settings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
timing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that waiting for a bus that has already passed is a result of poor timing. Timing refers to the ability to choose the right moment to do something, and waiting for a bus that has already passed likely means that the person missed their opportunity to catch the bus due to poor timing. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for the situation described in the sentence.
watch tv | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people had to wait while they washed their clothes at the laundromat, and that most people spent this time doing something else. Watching TV is a common activity for people who have to wait for extended periods of time, so it makes sense that this would be the answer. The other options (time, singing, getting wet, socks) do not fit with the context of the sentence.
country club | Knowledge: Investment bankers are often associated with high-income and luxurious lifestyles, which could suggest that they would frequent exclusive, upscale venues such as country clubs. Country clubs are typically known for their lavish amenities and services, making them a likely destination for individuals with significant wealth. The other options, such as Wall Street and City Hall, are more closely associated with financial institutions and government offices, respectively, and do not match the context of the question. Monopoly game and Michigan are also not likely options, as they do not represent real-life locations.
freedom of expression | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was surprised by the FBI's interest in their Facebook posts, which implies that the posts may have been controversial or expressed opinions that are not widely accepted. The options "money," "food and water," and "compliments" do not seem relevant to this context. "Freedom of information" could be a possible answer, but it does not fully capture the person's surprise and shock. "Freedom of expression," however, is a right that allows individuals to express themselves freely, even if it may be controversial or unpopular, and this is likely what the person wanted but felt threatened by the FBI's actions.
work | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason the teacher could write off paper clips was because they were necessary for her work. Businesses can typically write off expenses that are necessary for conducting their work, so the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is "work." The other options (drawer, fashioned into simple tools, desktop, university) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cape kennedy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the class was touring a location related to space and shuttle launches. Cape Kennedy is known for its connection to space travel and NASA, as it is the site of the Kennedy Space Center. Florida is also a possible answer as it is the state where the Kennedy Space Center is located. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
shops | Knowledge: Welding, home improvement, and manufacturing are all areas where metal rods are commonly used, and these activities usually take place in shops or factories. Broken bones are not related to the context of the sentence, and construction sites may use metal rods, but they are not the primary focus of the sentence. Cars and engines are also not mentioned in the sentence and have no clear connection to the context provided.
box | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cereal manufacturers make a decision about how to package their product, which is typically in a box. Cereal boxes are a common sight in grocery stores and households, and they are designed to keep the cereal fresh and easily accessible. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a cabinet or cupboard may be where cereal is stored, a fridge may be used for certain types of cereal, but these are not decisions made by cereal manufacturers. Mouth is also not a relevant option as it is not related to the packaging or storage of cereal.
Washington D.C. | Knowledge: The U.S. federal government is located in Washington D.C., which is the capital of the United States. The other options, such as Canada and country, are unrelated to the location of the U.S. federal government. The Capitol Building is a specific building in Washington D.C. where government officials meet, but it is not a location where the entire U.S. federal government is housed. Democracy is a political system, but it does not directly relate to the physical location of the U.S. federal government.
telephone | Knowledge: The question asks for an item that allows you to hear others but not be heard yourself, indicating that it has some sort of one-way communication functionality. Both television and radio simply broadcast without any interaction, so they do not fit the criteria. The mouth and song both involve speaking, making it impossible to solely listen. A telephone, on the other hand, allows you to hear the other person's voice through the receiver while your own voice is only transmitted when you speak into the microphone, making it the correct answer.
enslaved | Knowledge: The opposite of being free is being enslaved, which means being held against one's will and forced to work or serve someone without the ability to leave or make choices independently. The other options do not accurately reflect the opposite of being free. Being paid for or expensive suggests a transactional element, while imprisoned or locked up suggest confinement without necessarily implying forced labor.
church | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the folding chairs are meant to be used specifically for religious experiences, implying that they will be stored in a location related to religious activities. Among the given options, only "church" fits this description. The other options are more general and do not necessarily have any connection to religious activities.
afghanistan | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that bombs are dropped during wartime and provides a specific location where this is likely to happen. Afghanistan is known to be a country where the US has been involved in military conflicts and where bombing has taken place. The other options either have no connection to warfare or are not known for being targets of bombing during wartime.
oxygen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is having difficulty breathing, which is a common symptom of oxygen deprivation. At high altitudes, the air is thinner and has less oxygen, which can cause shortness of breath and other symptoms. The other options are unlikely to be the cause of breathing difficulties in this context.
tiredness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the toddler was sleeping, and is now waking up. It is common for people to feel tired after waking up from a nap, so the correct answer is likely related to a feeling commonly associated with waking up. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence – nervousness, eyes opening and getting out of bed are usually associated with waking up from a deep sleep, while discomfort may or may not be present depending on the toddler's sleeping position or other factors.
None of the choices are correct. | Knowledge: The question is asking for a solution to the problem of a poor road surface, which would not involve any of the given choices. "Object" and "yell" are not viable solutions, and "tetrahedron," "mirror," and "lake" are unrelated to the problem. A more appropriate answer might be to report the issue to the appropriate authority or to seek out a route with better road conditions.
stay alive | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the situation being discussed is dangerous, which implies that the person would be focused on staying alive. Compliments and talking fast are unlikely to be helpful in a dangerous situation, and high wages and a husband or wife are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
plant flowers | Knowledge: A garden is typically a place where plants are grown and cultivated, so the most logical answer would be "plant flowers." "Work" is too general and could refer to a variety of activities that might take place in a garden, such as weeding or pruning. "Catch cold" is not an activity that someone would intentionally do in a garden. "Gain respect" is not related to the context of the question, and "fish lake" is not an activity typically associated with a garden.
answering machine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question did not want to answer any calls, so he turned off his phone. The phrase "all anybody was going to hear from him today" suggests that he was planning to communicate a message of some sort, and the fact that he turned off his phone suggests that he did not want to do so over a live call. Therefore, the most likely answer is "answering machine" since it is a device used to record messages when someone is unable to answer a phone call. The other options, such as "office" or "telephonelines," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rain forest | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a monkey picking bananas from a tree, which is an activity often associated with monkeys that live in rain forests. Rain forests are known for being home to a diverse array of animal and plant species, including monkeys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
learning more about | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the artificial intelligence was constantly analyzing data, which is a process commonly associated with machine learning. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms that can learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the AI was programmed to always be learning more about the data it was analyzing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
snowball | Knowledge: The context of the question is about throwing something in December, which implies that it is likely to be a winter activity. The mention of water suggests that the answer should have some association with freezing or cold temperatures, which makes snowball the most suitable option. Tsunami, puddle, glass, and backpack do not match the context and don't make sense in the question.
atlas | Knowledge: John is lost and looking for direction, so it makes sense that he would need a map. An atlas is a collection of maps and is commonly used for navigation purposes. The other options, such as taco bell, amusement park, or classroom, do not provide any helpful resources for John to find his way. A truck stop may sell maps, but an atlas is a more specific and likely option for John's needs.
laughter | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Jerry had a super sense of humor, which is often associated with making people laugh. The phrase "entertaining" also suggests that Jerry was providing amusement or enjoyment to his audience, which is typically achieved through humor and laughter. The other options do not directly relate to humor or entertainment.
flight of stairs | Knowledge: The sentence describes a type of railing that is typically found on a structure with stairs or steps that lead upwards, such as a flight of stairs. The other options listed do not typically have railings for holding onto while moving up, and are therefore not the correct answer.
nature | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that encountering a snake on a plane is an uncommon occurrence, but more likely to happen while out in nature. Snakes are typically found in natural habitats, such as forests or grasslands. The options "pet shop" and "France" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, while "tropical forest" is a possible contender but less specific than "nature" which can refer to many different types of natural environments.
new york | Knowledge: New York is a famous location for movies and has many iconic subway stations that have been used in films. The other options may also have subway stations, but New York is the most well-known for its subway system and has been featured in countless movies over the years.
careful listening | Knowledge: The question refers to understanding testimony, which suggests that the listener is trying to grasp the information being conveyed. To do this successfully, they would need to engage in careful listening, which involves paying close attention to the speaker's words and tone, as well as any nonverbal cues. Ears and ability to hear are necessary for hearing the testimony, but they do not necessarily guarantee understanding. Change of heart and sleepiness are not relevant to the question.
disperse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the students were gathered in one place for an announcement, but then began to move away from that location. The word "disperse" means to scatter or go in different directions, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices don't make sense in this context - "spread" and "disseminate" may imply the students shared information, while "park" and "dispense" don't have any connection to the idea of the students moving away from one location.
patient | Knowledge: Lying in bed for extended periods of time can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers or bed sores, especially for patients who are bedridden or have limited mobility. Therefore, the most likely answer is "patient". The other options may not necessarily be lying in bed or may not be at as high of a risk for developing wounds.
form crystals | Knowledge: The process of water turning into ice is called freezing, and involves the formation of crystals as water molecules slow down and arrange themselves into a solid structure. The other options do not accurately describe the process of water becoming ice.
known about | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah's husband was already aware of something related to the trip, which is why the surprise failed. The correct option would be "known about" because it directly implies a pre-existing knowledge of the trip. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "predictable" and "bland" describe qualities of something, while "bought tickets" and "sneaky" imply actions and intentions.
retire | Knowledge: The question specifies that the police officer is in their sixties, which suggests that they may be nearing retirement age. Typically, police officers retire in their late 50s or early 60s, depending on their years of service and the specific retirement plan they are enrolled in. The other options do not necessarily have any correlation with age or retirement.
garage  | Knowledge: A garage is a place where automobiles are stored and kept safe, so it makes sense that it would be a good place for an automobile to be. A driveway is also a possibility, but it is not necessarily a "good" place as it is open to the elements and other potential hazards. A repair shop and junk yard are places where automobiles go when they are damaged or no longer functioning properly, so they are not good places to be for a working automobile. An exit ramp is a section of a highway where cars exit, and it is not a place for an automobile to be parked or stored.
survive | Knowledge: The use of the word "poor" suggests that the person may not have regular access to food, and therefore their primary goal would be to survive by obtaining enough nutrients to sustain themselves. While digesting and being full are important aspects of the process, the key goal is to avoid starvation. Getting fat is not a necessary or desirable outcome for a person who is struggling to obtain food.
fish market | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was unaware of the edibility of a blowfish and that they were surprised to see it in a particular location. A fish market is a plausible location where a blowfish could be encountered as it is a place where various types of seafood are sold. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dining room | Knowledge: Tables are commonly associated with dining rooms, where people gather to eat together. The other options do not logically fit the context of the question. A furniture store may sell tables, but it is not where people typically have them. A kitchen may have a table for eating as well, but it is not the most common location. A bathroom or conference room would be an unlikely location for a table.
kitchen counter | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally wants to keep her saltshaker in a convenient location, but also one that is not intrusive. This rules out options such as the dinner table or table setting, which are typically used for preparing and serving food. The own kitchen option is too vague, as it could refer to any location in the kitchen. The cabinet option is also incorrect, as this would require Sally to reach up or bend down to access the saltshaker, which would not be considered a convenient location. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the kitchen counter, which is a common location for frequently-used items like salt and pepper shakers.
rocket | Knowledge: The question is asking how we could get far enough up into the air around Earth that we cannot be seen. Using a balloon, space shuttle, or house would not take us high enough to be out of sight. A supermarket is not even a method of transportation, so it is not a viable option. A rocket, on the other hand, can propel us far enough away from Earth that we would not be visible without instruments. Therefore, rocket is the correct answer.
war | Knowledge: The four horsemen of the apocalypse are often depicted as death, famine, war, and conquest. In many depictions, death and war are positioned next to each other, suggesting a connection between the two. The other options, such as battlefield or hospital, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
weird | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are acting in an unusual way, which is often described using words like "weird" or "odd". These words imply that their behavior does not conform to social norms, and may be seen as strange or inexplicable by others. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior being discussed, and would not be appropriate choices to complete the sentence.
hen house | Knowledge: Weasels are known to be small, agile hunters that are able to navigate through tight spaces. A loose weasel in a hen house would be particularly destructive because weasels are known to prey on small animals like chickens, and a loose weasel would likely be able to move freely through the hen house and hunt without being noticed. The other options are less likely to be affected by a loose weasel, as they either do not have significant populations of animals vulnerable to weasel predation, or are too expansive to be meaningfully impacted by a single weasel.
wear jeans | Knowledge: The question suggests that the focus is on protecting one's legs from getting dirty on a farm. Wearing jeans is a common practice on farms as they are sturdy and thick enough to protect one's legs from mud, dirt, and scratches. Milking cows, belief in God, planting flowers, and avoiding mud do not directly address the issue of protecting one's legs while working on a farm.
erections | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a certain reaction that men have when they see a nude woman on TV. Based on common reactions and stereotypes surrounding male sexuality, it is likely that the correct answer is erections. The other options do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
bones | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the only remaining evidence of the ancient giant lizards are fossils and something else. Fossils are remnants of bones or other hard body parts of extinct organisms, which is why bones is the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as sex to produce offspring and having four legs are not unique to ancient giant lizards and pictures are not physical remnants of the species.
cabinet  | Knowledge: Plates are typically stored in a cabinet in the kitchen or dining area of a home. They may also be found on a table when they are being used for eating, but this is not a permanent storage location. Plates are not typically stored in a dishwasher or a fridge, which are used for washing and storing food, respectively. Finally, a restaurant is not a location within a home and is therefore not a probable answer to this question.
laugh | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the expected response to a funny joke is laughter. If someone laughs at your joke, it means that they found it amusing, and there is no surprise involved. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Scaring someone, receiving flowers, or keeping a secret are all unrelated to telling a joke, and crying is typically not a common response to humor.
fall asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that attending meetings can be boring for some people. The phrase "fall asleep" is commonly associated with being bored or uninterested in something. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
It depends on the context of the situation, all choices could potentially be correct depending on the individual parent and their reasoning for telling their kids to play games. There is no one clear answer without additional information.
city centre | Knowledge: A bus station is typically located in or near the city centre, as it serves as a transportation hub where people can easily access various parts of the city. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
experience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the performance in question is interactive, which means that it involves active participation from the audience. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this aspect of the performance. "Experience" is the best choice, as it suggests that the person wants to engage with the performance in some way. The other options ("know where," "leave," "applaud," and "admiration") do not capture the interactive nature of the performance described in the sentence.
lies | Knowledge: Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law. Therefore, someone committing perjury is likely lying. The other options do not relate to the definition or meaning of perjury.
conference | Knowledge: A meeting that is described as "large" implies that a significant number of people will be present, and thus a venue with sufficient space is required. Among the options, conference halls are specifically designed for this purpose and are frequently used for large-scale gatherings such as conventions or meetings. The other choices are not as applicable to this context; for example, a church may not have the necessary technology for a large meeting, a dormitory is unlikely to have a dedicated space for a gathering of this size, and a library may not have the seating capacity for such an event.
tsunami | Knowledge: The phrase "giant wall of water" is commonly associated with tsunamis, which are large waves caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. The other options, such as backpack, allen key, and snowball, do not have any association with the given phrase. The option "ocean" may seem plausible, but it does not fully capture the context of the sentence, as the phrase describes a specific type of wave and not the entire body of water.
ring | Knowledge: Brownstones are a type of row house that is commonly found in cities like New York. They are known for their architectural features, such as ornate entryways and facades, and are often associated with wealth and luxury. Given the context of the sentence, it is likely that the answer is related to theft or burglary. A ring is a valuable item that is often targeted by thieves due to its small size and high value, making it a likely choice for what someone might try to steal from a brownstone. The other options - subdivision, live in, new york city, and circlet - do not have any clear connection to theft or brownstones.
blue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the song is well-known and that it is about a girl with a particular physical characteristic. The phrase "eyes that were" indicates that the song is describing the color of the girl's eyes. Of the choices given, only "blue" and "brown" are commonly used to describe the color of eyes. "Green" could also be a possibility, but it is less common. "Sad" and "tear up" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being tired | Knowledge: The question is asking for a potential feeling that someone may experience as a result of jogging. While increased heart rate and improved health are positive outcomes of exercise, they are not necessarily feelings. Frightened is unlikely to be a feeling associated with jogging unless the context provides more information. Shin splints may be a physical sensation that someone experiences while jogging, but it is not a feeling. Being tired is a possible feeling that someone may experience after jogging, as it can be a physically demanding activity.
headaches | Knowledge: The word "cogitating" implies deep and prolonged thinking or contemplation, which can often lead to mental strain or exhaustion. This is reflected in the option "headaches," which is a common side effect of intensive thinking. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cub | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a "wild animal" caused the damage to the carpeting, indicating that the perpetrator was not likely to be a human being. The term "cub" refers to a young animal, such as a bear or a lion, which could have caused the damage. The other options are unlikely to be the culprit because they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
church | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location is a place where people gather to listen to someone speaking on a regular basis. A church is a common place of worship where people attend services and listen to sermons preached by a religious leader. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not typically involve a speaker addressing an audience.
play | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the school is putting on some kind of theatrical production that involves children acting. Of the choices provided, "play" is the term commonly used to refer to a staged production of a story or script. "Movies" and "television" refer to visual media that are typically not performed live, while "fancy dress" suggests a costume party or event that is not necessarily related to acting. "Show" is a more general term that could refer to any type of performance or exhibition, but "play" is the most specific answer that fits the context of the sentence.
climb stairs | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the clean laundry is located in the basement, which typically means that the person will need to go up a flight of stairs to reach the bedroom. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that would help in choosing the correct answer.
commit crimes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who need money badly may resort to doing something illegal, which is a common reason to commit crimes. While "part company" and "go swimming" are not related to the context of the sentence, "criminal" is a broad term that does not provide a clear answer. "Believe in god" also does not provide a clear answer and is not related to the context of the sentence.
South Africa | Knowledge: Nelson Mandela was a prominent political figure in South Africa and his grave site would likely be located in his home country. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where the grave site might be located. The reference to an apple tree may be a distractor and not relevant to the answer.
newspaper | Knowledge: The question is asking where someone might have a statement printed, which implies that it is being distributed or published to a larger audience. While it is possible to have a statement printed and mailed, or included in a letter, these options are more limited in terms of distribution. A press release is also a possibility, but typically these are distributed to media outlets rather than printed directly. A smartphone is a device, not a location for printing. A newspaper, on the other hand, is commonly used for publishing statements and other information for a broader audience.
compare prices | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when shopping for an expensive product, it is important to get the best deal. The best way to ensure this is by comparing prices of the product at different stores before making a purchase. Standing in line, meeting friends, and living without it are not relevant to getting the best deal, and "purchasing" is not a helpful suggestion as it is already assumed that the person will be making a purchase.
backyard or garden | Knowledge: Lizards are often found in places where they can bask in the sun, hide in crevices, and have access to insects and other small prey. A backyard or garden can provide all of these things, making them a likely location to find lizards. Rock walls, stream beds, and the great outdoors can also be home to lizards, but they are less commonly associated with them than backyards and gardens.
muscles | Knowledge: Exercising vigorously results in the breakdown of muscle fibers, which then rebuild stronger and larger during the process of muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, building muscles is a direct and logical outcome of exercising vigorously. Options such as need for food and thirst are related to exercising but not necessarily to vigorous exercise specifically, while sweating is a side effect of exercise but doesn't necessarily indicate building muscles. Fitness itself is a goal of exercising but not something that is physically built in the same way as muscles.
work | Knowledge: The word "office" is typically associated with work and the workplace. The other options, such as a zoo or school building, typically do not have large numbers of office spaces. "Public building" and "city" are more general terms and do not specifically reference a location where there would be a large number of offices.
labor problems | Knowledge: The phrase "surprising strike" suggests that this is referring to a sudden and unexpected work stoppage, which is commonly referred to as a strike. The context of the sentence implies that this strike is related to some sort of labor issue, such as a disagreement between workers and management over wages, benefits, or working conditions. The other options (funny, frightened, humor, and fight) do not make sense in the given sentence.
go skiing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is at a high elevation with no buildings around, which indicates that they are likely in a mountainous area. Skiing is a popular recreational activity in mountainous regions, which makes it a likely answer to the question. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
deep grass | Knowledge: Snakes are known to use camouflage and hiding to ambush their prey. Of the given options, only "deep grass" could provide adequate hiding for a snake. The other options are unlikely or unsuitable for snake habitation or hiding.
building | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the installation of lights was intended to attract visitors to a particular location. It is unlikely that lights would be installed on a carnival or a plane, as these are mobile and temporary structures. A yatch (or yacht) might have lights installed for safety reasons, but not necessarily to attract visitors. "Turned at night" does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, "building" is the most logical and likely option.
tropical forest | Knowledge: The word "native" implies that the ficus tree originally came from a certain place or region. "Apartment," "zoo," and "dictionary" are not locations where plants are native to, so they can be eliminated as incorrect choices. The ficus tree is commonly found in tropical regions, which makes "tropical forest" the most likely correct answer. The middle east is not typically associated with the ficus tree.
offer to help | Knowledge: The question specifically mentions that the friend is unable to lift the groceries themselves, so it is important to take action to assist them. Out of the given options, "offering to help" would be the most appropriate choice in this situation. "Write letter" and "promise to help" may not provide immediate assistance, while "relying on" the friend could lead to them being unable to complete their errand. "Do not help" would be an inappropriate option and would not fulfill the ethical responsibility to help a friend in need.
anguish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was not only interested in killing their victims, but also in causing them additional suffering. The word "revenge" implies that they were seeking some kind of payback for a perceived wrongdoing, and the choice of "anguish" suggests that they wanted their victims to suffer emotionally, perhaps in addition to physical pain. The other options may be possible outcomes of the person's actions, but they do not directly align with the context of the sentence.
magazine | Knowledge: Shiny advertisements are often found in magazines as they are printed on glossy paper that enhances the colors and shine of the ad. Ads in emails are typically not shiny as they are viewed on a screen. Store advertisements may be shiny, but the context of the sentence suggests that the ad is portable or in a specific location. Bus advertisements may be shiny but the context suggests that the ad is not moving. Closets are not typically used for advertisements.
free food | Knowledge: A soup kitchen is a place where free food is offered to those in need, often homeless or low-income individuals. The other choices have no logical connection to the purpose of a soup kitchen.
slavery | Knowledge: The American Civil War was primarily fought over the issue of slavery. Many states in the South relied heavily on the slave trade to support their economy, while Northern states were increasingly opposed to the practice. As tensions rose between the two regions, the issue of slavery became a flashpoint for conflict and eventually led to the outbreak of war. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
shortness of breath | Knowledge: This question is asking for a potential negative effect of exercising. While lifting weights and running are forms of exercise, they are not necessarily negative effects. Collapsing is a potential negative effect, but it is not a common one. Error is not related to exercising. Shortness of breath, however, is a common negative effect, especially for those who are new to exercising or have certain health conditions.
cabinet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that nails need to be placed somewhere in order to prevent them from causing damage to other items in proximity. Putting nails in a cabinet would likely keep them out of sight and away from other objects, reducing the likelihood of damage. The other options do not seem to provide a clear solution to the problem presented.
getting wet | Knowledge: Washing clothes manually involves manually rubbing the clothes while they are submerged in a basin or bucket of water and soap. This process requires getting your hands wet and may also require bending down to manipulate the clothes, making getting wet a likely outcome. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of washing clothes manually.
traffic accident | Knowledge: The use of emergency vehicles suggests that there was likely some kind of accident or emergency situation that occurred on the road. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The words "calm" and "productive" suggest that the carpet is being installed in a professional or work-related environment, where employees need to be focused and efficient. The options "bowling alley" and "church" do not fit this description. Although a carpet could be installed in a building or floor, these options are too broad and do not provide specific context for the type of environment the carpet is being installed in, leaving "office" as the most logical choice.
create music | Knowledge: Singers typically go to a studio to record and produce music. Although warming up and clearing their throats may be a part of the process, the ultimate goal is to create a final product. "Sound beautiful" and "make noise" are not specific enough to be the correct answer, whereas "create music" accurately summarizes the purpose of a singer's visit to a studio.
fun | Knowledge: The question implies that someone is engaging in a leisure activity (chatting with friends) while also attempting to engage in a physical activity (working out). Therefore, it can be inferred that the reason for chatting is to add an element of enjoyment or pleasure to the workout, rather than seeking answers or inspiration. "Fun" is the most appropriate answer choice out of the given options.
get cold | Knowledge: The phrase "hunkered down" suggests that Cameron was trying to stay warm. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he was sleeping "under the covers," which reinforces the idea that he was trying to stay warm. The other options, such as "talking," "snoring," or "wet bed," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Might dream" is possible, but it is not directly supported by the sentence.
eat quickly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is already in possession of a meal, indicating that they probably don't need to order food or spend money. The fact that they are hungry suggests that they are likely to eat quickly in order to alleviate their hunger. Beginning work or having lunch may be options for later once the person has satisfied their immediate hunger.
countryside | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions, but the question specifies a midwestern area. The Great Plains and jungle are not known for having mountain terrain or marmots, making those choices unlikely. The option of an encyclopedia is not a geographical area where a marmot could run free. Therefore, the most likely choice is countryside, which could include hilly or rocky areas that could potentially be home to marmots. The zoo would not have a marmot running free as they are typically kept in enclosures.
bedroom | Knowledge: The question suggests that a television is being used specifically at night, which implies that someone is trying to watch TV while they are in bed. Therefore, the most likely option is a bedroom. A cabinet, house, or apartment could all contain a bedroom, but without further context it is impossible to determine if these answers are correct. The option "woods" is clearly incorrect as it has no connection to the given context.
cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sean put away his groceries, which suggests that he may have put the teabags in the same place. The options "mug," "refrigerator," and "teapot" are unlikely places to put teabags away, and the option "internet cafe" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The most likely place to store teabags at home is in a cupboard, making this the correct answer.
cornfield | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scenario takes place in the midwest and involves someone being chased, which implies that the answer will be something that is commonly found in rural or outdoor areas. Cornfields are a common crop in the midwest and provide ample cover for someone to hide in, making it the most practical choice. The other options, such as workplace, restroom, Star Trek, and space, have no connection to the scenario described in the sentence.
rich | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who grows up poor in America can ultimately achieve financial success. The word "end up" implies a change in economic status from poor to rich. The other choices do not accurately reflect this specific context of social mobility and economic success.
new orleans | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone might acquire beads while on a balcony, which is a common tradition during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. During Mardi Gras, people throw beads from balconies as part of the celebration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
going to jail  | Knowledge: When someone is on trial for killing another person, the jury's decision would typically be based on whether the person is guilty or not guilty of the crime. If found guilty, the jury would likely decide on a punishment, which could include going to jail. Execution is a possible punishment in some jurisdictions, but it is not always an option. Investigation is something that is done by law enforcement to gather evidence, while retribution is not a legal concept in the same way that punishment is.
kitchen drawer | Knowledge: A butcher knife is a type of kitchen knife that is typically used for cutting, trimming, and preparing meat. Therefore, it is important to keep it in a place that is easily accessible in the kitchen, such as a kitchen drawer. Keeping it in a fishing boat, backpack, or pocket would not be practical or safe, as it could potentially harm someone accidentally. While a shelf might be an option, it may not be as secure or easily accessible as a kitchen drawer.
organ | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Sally's boss told her to stop playing because she was being loud. This suggests that Sally was playing a musical instrument like an organ, which can produce loud sounds. The other options, such as telegram, telegraph, motor, and chess, do not involve making loud noises and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
bringing to picnic | Knowledge: The context of the question is suggesting a place where one would bring a picnic basket filled with food. The correct answer is "bringing to picnic" as it directly relates to the context of the question. The other options, such as "country", "supermarket", "kitchen", and "deli" do not fit the context of this question as they do not involve bringing a picnic basket filled with food to a specific location.
learn things | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher's job was focused on teaching and that she took pride in it. The phrase "getting kids to" implies that the teacher's goal was to help the students learn something, which is supported by the fact that she took great pride in her work. The other options do not necessarily involve teaching or education and are not supported by the context of the sentence.
fort | Knowledge: The presence of a cannon suggests that this is a location related to warfare or military history. A fort is a structure used for military defense and is commonly associated with cannons and historical warfare. A pirate ship may also have a cannon, but it is not typically used as an educational location for learning about history. A warship and war museum may have cannons as well, but a fort is more specifically related to the context of the question.
large pot | Knowledge: The sentence provides context clues that suggest the ficus, which is too big for Billy's house, is currently waiting outside. The most logical place for a potted plant to wait outside would be in another pot/container, hence the correct answer being "large pot." The other options, such as park or maze, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A tropical forest or a green house could be a possibility, but it is not indicated in the sentence whether the ficus is in one of these locations.
dark place | Knowledge: The question suggests that the creature is invisible, which means it is likely hiding or camouflaged. The option "dark place" implies that the creature may be hiding in a location where it is difficult to see, while the other options do not provide any insight into the whereabouts of the creature. The zoo option is unlikely because creatures in a zoo are typically visible to the public, and in a cage or woods, it would still be possible to see the creature even if it is hiding.
underneath | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is hiding, and specifically mentions that he pulled a cover over his head. This implies that he is somewhere underneath the cover, such as hiding under a blanket or sheet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tiles | Knowledge: When it comes to designing a shower, the most common material used for both the walls and floor is tiles. Tiles are durable, easy to clean, and water-resistant, making them an ideal choice for an area that is constantly exposed to water. While some people may choose other materials for their shower, such as stone or acrylic, these options are less common and may not provide the same level of functionality as tiles. The other options listed are not materials typically associated with showers.
sorrow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going to the public store when sad may evoke a particular feeling. The most appropriate answer would be sorrow, as this emotion is typically associated with sadness. Embarrassment, pain, sleepy, and panic do not seem to relate to the context of the sentence.
first rate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the visitor had a positive experience at the hotel, which is the opposite of the previous hotel that was bad. The phrase "first rate" implies that the visitor thought the hotel was excellent or top-notch. The other options do not convey a strong positive sentiment and/or do not fit the context of the sentence.
past | Knowledge: The sentence describes the dime store as being full of "old donated goods," which suggests that the items in the store are outdated or from a previous era. The phrase "reminded the customer of the" indicates that the correct answer will describe something from the past. Therefore, the correct answer is "past." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
spend money | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is regarding the process of buying beer at a store. When buying any product at a store, one usually has to pay for it, which is done by spending money. The other options, such as filling bottles, having fun, or stupidity, do not seem to be related to the process of buying beer at a store.
legal problems | Knowledge: The question asks about the consequence of hurting someone else, which suggests that the action is considered illegal or harmful in some way. Legal problems are a common consequence of hurting someone else, as the injured party may choose to take legal action against the person who caused harm. Punishment may also be a consequence, but that generally involves legal processes and may overlap with legal problems. Happiness is unlikely to be a consequence of harming someone else, and physical pain and public outcry are not consequences that are directly related to the legal system or breaking the law.
church basement | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking for an affordable location to have a reception, which suggests that fancy or high-end options like a country club or restaurant may be too expensive. Outside could be an option, but has no clear association with affordability. A church basement is often a common, cost-effective choice for weddings and receptions. A wedding party is not a location, so it can be eliminated as an option.
Australia | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "barbecuing kangaroo meat" and "camping in the outback," which are both strongly associated with Australia. Kangaroos are native to Australia and are often used as a source of meat there. The outback is a vast, remote region in Australia known for its rugged and arid landscape, and camping is a popular activity in this area. The other options, such as retail store, Detroit, Wyoming, and Michigan park, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
peel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the objective is to remove the skin from an apple, which is typically done by peeling it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tools | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is a mechanic, which is a profession that involves repairing and maintaining machines. As such, they would likely need a variety of tools to perform their job, including wrenches, sockets, and screwdrivers. The other options are specific to certain types of machines, such as an oil machine with grease or oil engine, or machine parts and machine tools, which may be required for manufacturing and production processes. However, a mechanic would primarily need tools to perform repairs and maintenance on various machines.
motorcycle | Knowledge: A ring road is a type of road that encircles a city or town, providing a bypass for through-traffic and connecting various highways and roads. It is unlikely to find a ring road for a motorcycle, as a motorcycle is a single vehicle and would not need a bypass road around a city or town. The other options are all possible locations for a ring road.
tiredness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that spending the whole day shopping can have a negative effect on the body or mind. Obesity, bankruptcy, and debt are all financial or health-related outcomes that do not directly relate to shopping. Calluses are a physical effect on the hands or feet, but they are not necessarily caused by shopping. Tiredness, on the other hand, is a common result of spending a long time on one's feet, moving from store to store, and making numerous decisions, making it the most likely answer.
charge according to time | Knowledge: The word "solicitor" suggests that we are talking about a legal professional. Legal professionals often charge clients on an hourly basis, meaning that they would charge according to their time spent on a case. Buying a house, claiming compensation, writing a letter, and going to court may all be things that a solicitor does, but those actions do not necessarily guarantee revenue. Charging clients for their time spent on a case is a primary way that solicitors make money.
hospital or doctor's office | Knowledge: Both hospitals and doctor's offices are places where medical treatment can be received for an illness. While an elderly or sick person may receive care at these locations, they are not the solutions themselves. Stomach is also not a feasible answer as it is merely an organ and cannot treat an illness.
dishwasher or cupboard | Knowledge: After a salad bowl has been used, it can either be washed in the dishwasher or put away in the cupboard. The dishwasher is a common place to clean dishes, including bowls, after they have been used. However, if the bowl is not dirty enough to require a full wash, it may be put away in the cupboard for future use. Salad bars, buffets, and trash cans are not appropriate places to put a used salad bowl.
flower shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being described specialized in colorful arrangements, which is commonly associated with flowers. Additionally, the mention of a toy balloon suggests that the place may cater to children or events such as birthday parties, which is also commonly associated with flower shops. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
strip mall | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the beauty salon is located within a larger complex of shops, as it mentions people coming and going to various stores. This is typically characteristic of a strip mall, which is a type of shopping center where stores are arranged in a row or strip, often with a shared parking lot. The other options do not have any clear connection to the idea of a group of shops located together.
effort | Knowledge: The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that is the opposite of fun. Playing around, activity, video games, and relaxing are all things that can be associated with having fun, so they cannot be the opposite. Effort, on the other hand, can often be associated with things that are not fun, such as hard work or chores. Therefore, effort is the most fitting answer for the opposite of having fun.
country club | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple had a membership that provided access to both golfing and tennis, which is a common feature of country clubs. Country clubs often offer a range of amenities, including golf courses, tennis courts, and other recreational facilities, which would explain why the husband and wife were both happy with their membership. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
accidents | Knowledge: Generally, someone wouldn't intentionally park a moving car unless they are experiencing an emergency situation, such as avoiding an accident. Parking a moving car can be extremely dangerous and is not a common practice. The other options, such as getting a ticket or getting tired, do not make sense in the context of the question.
bring joy | Knowledge: The question asks about the likely outcome of loving someone, and the answer "bring joy" is most consistent with common beliefs and experiences about love. Love is often associated with positive feelings and experiences, such as happiness and contentment, which can bring joy to both people involved in the relationship. The other options, such as giving money or hurting someone, are not typically associated with healthy or loving relationships.
big city | Knowledge: Colleges are typically found in larger cities or towns, where there is a larger population and greater demand for higher education institutions. Building and electrical circuit do not make sense as options since they are not typically associated with the location of colleges. Fraternity house is a specific type of housing for college students, but it is not a location where multiple colleges would be found. Big town could also be a possibility, but big city is a more clear and obvious choice.
park | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a place where humans go to escape cities, which suggests that the correct answer is a location that is outside of a city. The options "movie theatre" and "university" do not fit this criteria, as they are typically located within a city. The option "country" appears twice, but it is unclear which one is the correct answer. However, the option "park" fits the context of the sentence, as parks are often located outside of a city and provide a natural setting for people to escape the urban environment.
eat fruit | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is an alternative to having candy as a sweet snack, and the correct answer is likely to be a viable and healthy option. Eating fruit is a common substitute for sugary treats, as it provides natural sweetness, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or inappropriate for humans craving a sweet snack.
manipulate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the real estate agent was able to persuade people to do things in a potentially manipulative way. The other options either do not have a negative connotation or do not fit the context of the sentence. Manipulation is often associated with persuasive tactics that are not entirely honest or transparent, which aligns with the idea of "getting anybody to do anything."
building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the current location of the outdoor restaurant is not suitable for rain, indicating that it may be exposed to the elements. Moving to a building would provide shelter and protect customers from the rain, making it a logical choice. While the other options may provide different environments, they do not directly address the issue of rain.
lose money | Knowledge: Gambling often involves putting money at risk, so it is likely that a common outcome of gambling is losing money. Penury and bankruptcy suggest a more extreme financial situation than simply losing money, and addiction and risky suggest a more emotional or behavioral response to gambling rather than a direct financial outcome.
wool sweater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was a bad pet owner who did something inappropriate to her cat. Out of the given options, a wool sweater is the most likely object that one would put on a cat, and it is also something that a cat may not be comfortable wearing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
bathroom sink | Knowledge: The context implies that the washcloth needs to be cleaned, which suggests that it needs to be washed. Bathroom sinks are commonly used for washing and cleaning purposes, like washing your hands or face, so it would be logical to put a washcloth in the bathroom sink to clean it. The other options, like bed bath store or walmart, don't make sense in the context of the question, and the linen closet or closet aren't typically used for cleaning items like washcloths.
getting drunk | Knowledge: The use of the word "drinks" suggests that the context is related to alcohol consumption. Celebrating with excessive alcohol intake can often lead to getting drunk, which can have negative consequences such as impaired judgment, risk of accidents, and hangover. While the other options may be associated with celebrations, they are not directly related to the consequence of excessive drinking.
atmosphere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the balloon is capable of rising high, which is typically associated with reaching high altitude in the atmosphere. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. An aeroplane is not related to a balloon, the moon is far too high for a balloon to reach, and laboratory and chemistry lab are not related to the concept of a balloon rising.
shredder | Knowledge: The word "confetti" suggests that something needs to be cut into small pieces. A shredder is a common tool used to cut paper into small pieces, which is often used to make confetti. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
hurt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is willing to face a difficult or unpleasant truth, which is often associated with being hurt. Enlightenment and satisfaction suggest a positive outcome, while happiness may not necessarily involve discovering the truth. Shock is also a possibility, but it is not as strong a suggestion as being hurt.
skateboard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is bored and is seeking some form of entertainment. The security guard allows him to do something to pass the time, but the context of the sentence indicates that it is a relatively physical activity. "Grind" is a term commonly used in skateboarding when a skateboarder slides down a rail or edge of a surface. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "skateboard," as it is the only option that fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not involve physical activity, and some, like "meet interesting people" or "listen to music," are less likely to be allowed by a security guard in a particular environment.
take shoes off | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common behavior or action that kids need to do before they can go outside a house. Taking off shoes before entering a house is a common practice in many cultures, especially in Asian and Middle Eastern households. This is often done to keep the house clean and free from outside dirt and germs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
american city | Knowledge: Expressways are typically found in urban areas where there is a high volume of traffic and a need to move vehicles quickly through the city. This eliminates options such as medium and country, which do not have a large number of expressways. Eastern United States and Michigan are too broad and do not provide enough specific information to answer the question. Therefore, the correct answer is American city.
own home | Knowledge: Zillow is a real estate website used by people who are looking to buy or rent a home. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a computer user using Zillow has the goal of finding a new place to live, which could include purchasing or renting a house or apartment. The other options, such as "hell" or "office building", do not align with the purpose of using a real estate website like Zillow.
fairgrounds | Knowledge: The phrase "lots of people around you" suggests a social setting with a large crowd, which is commonly found at fairgrounds where people gather for fun, food, and games. The other options do not have any clear connection to a social setting with lots of people. "Good" is too vague without any context and "friend's house" may or may not have a large number of people depending on the situation. "Watching television" and "expensive" are unlikely to provide a social atmosphere with a large crowd.
Canada | Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific type of government system which consists of a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary democracy, and federation. Canada is an example of such a country, as it has a monarch as the head of state, a parliamentary system of government where members of parliament are elected by citizens, and also follows a federal system of government where power is divided between the central government and provincial governments. The other options do not relate to the specific government system mentioned in the question.
mouth | Knowledge: The question is asking for the body part that every person uses to talk. The mouth contains the tongue, teeth, and vocal cords that allow for speech production, making it the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
sparks fly | Knowledge: "Sparks fly" is a common metaphor used to describe a strong and immediate attraction between two people. In a machine shop, sparks are often produced during the process of cutting or welding metal, so the use of this metaphor would connect to the environment and suggest a strong and intense attraction. The other choices are not commonly associated with flirting or the context of a machine shop.
suburbs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mall is a part of a larger group of houses and businesses, which typically refers to suburban areas. Malls are commonly found in suburban areas where there is more space to build and where there is a larger population of potential shoppers. The other options do not fit this description as well.
have no home | Knowledge: The phrase "living on the streets" implies that the person is homeless and does not have a permanent residence. The other options do not accurately describe the situation of being homeless. The word "shameful" implies a sense of wrongdoing, which is not necessarily applicable to the situation of being homeless. "Ridiculous" and "lazy" are judgmental and insensitive terms that do not reflect the complex realities of homelessness. "Restricted" does not accurately describe the lack of a permanent home.
brooklyn | Knowledge: Brownstone is a type of sandstone that is commonly used in the construction of buildings in the Northeastern United States, particularly in areas such as Brooklyn, New York City. Therefore, the most likely answer is Brooklyn, as it is a borough of New York City and is known for its architecture featuring brownstone buildings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the horse escaped to a place where it could roam freely, which is commonly associated with the countryside. Horses are often kept in paddocks or stables in urban or suburban areas and may not have access to the open space and freedom they require. The other options are not as likely as countryside to provide the open space the horse needs.
purse | Knowledge: The question implies that a woman wants to keep her sunglasses with her and not lose them. A purse is a commonly used accessory to carry personal items, including sunglasses. The other options (drugstore, movie theater, shirt pocket) are not appropriate places to store sunglasses as they do not offer protection or easy access. A bag could be a viable option but it is not clear what kind of bag is being referred to.
headache | Knowledge: The question implies that learning about a complex and difficult subject could have a negative impact on someone. It's possible that the person could experience frustration or feel overwhelmed, but the most likely answer is a headache. Learning new information and processing complicated concepts can be mentally exhausting, which could lead to physical discomfort. The other options do not make logical sense as negative side effects of learning about a difficult subject.
arthritis | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the aging rockstar had to stop playing guitar due to a physical condition affecting their hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects joint mobility and could make it difficult for anyone, including a musician, to play an instrument. The other choices do not relate to a physical condition that would affect a musician's ability to play an instrument.
feel pride | Knowledge: Jogging is a form of exercise that is generally associated with positive health benefits. It is common to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride after completing a jog, as it is a challenging physical activity that requires discipline and effort. The other options are all negative outcomes that are not typically associated with jogging, such as heart attacks and sore feet.
library | Knowledge: In the context of the question, the most likely place to find maps would be in a library. Libraries typically have a wide variety of books and resources, including maps, which can be borrowed or kept for reference. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question – guide drivers are unlikely to have extra maps to give away, bookstores may not have a large selection of maps, and cabinets and drawers are not typically associated with acquiring maps.
stage | Knowledge: A performer typically stands on a stage during a performance, whether it is a play, musical, or dance. The other options, such as see saw and party, do not typically involve a performer standing or performing on something specific. Opera is also performed on a stage, but the question is asking about what a performer stands on, which is more closely associated with theater performances.
failure | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a potential obstacle that could prevent someone from opening a business. The option "failure" is the most relevant choice as it directly relates to the potential risks and challenges of starting a business. The other options like "get rich" or "wealth" do not seem to fit in the context of the sentence because they suggest a motivation rather than an obstacle. The option "busy" is also unlikely to be the correct answer because being busy is not always a barrier to starting a business, and it does not necessarily stop someone from pursuing their goals.
heat up | Knowledge: When a car is left in the sun for an extended period of time, the interior of the car can become very hot due to the heat. This can cause the temperature to rise and make the interior uncomfortable for passengers to sit in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
carnival | Knowledge: The words "light," "games," and "music" are often associated with carnivals, which are festive events that usually involve parades, amusement rides, and street performances. Concerts and discos may involve music and light, but they do not typically involve games. Planes are unrelated to celebrations and do not fit the context of the sentence. Christmas may involve lights and music, but it does not typically involve games in the way that carnivals do.
city | Knowledge: Enclosed markets are typically found in urban or city areas where there is limited space and a high concentration of people. In contrast, fields and rural areas are more likely to have open-air markets, and villages may have a mix of both. Mexico is a country and therefore is not a likely location for an enclosed market without specifying a city or region.
cum | Knowledge: The word "procreating" is a euphemism for sexual activity, specifically reproduction. The sentence indicates that Sam enjoys a specific aspect of this activity, and the word "cum" refers to semen, which is typically associated with male pleasure during sexual activity. The other options may be associated with sexual activity, but they are not as directly related to male pleasure or reproduction as "cum."
It depends on the context, as each of these locations could contain a table with a laptop on it.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that listening to music while reading had a positive effect on John. It mentions that it helped him, so we can infer that it had a beneficial impact. The other options may have a negative or neutral impact on reading comprehension or enjoyment, but relaxation is commonly associated with reducing stress and increasing focus, which would support the idea that John found it easier to read while listening to music that helped him relax.
football stadium | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fan has been watching the team play on Sundays, suggesting that the team likely plays a sport that is typically played on Sundays, such as football. The sentence also mentions the fan seeing a snap "live," which implies that they will be physically present at the game, ruling out options like a living room where they might watch a game on television. Finally, the phrase "enter a" suggests that they will be entering a specific space, further supporting the idea that the answer is a football stadium rather than a general location like a basketball court.
clear area | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a radio studio would not be found. An office building or college may have a radio studio as part of their communication or media departments. Broadcasting music could refer to a radio station, which would obviously have a radio studio. Large cities are likely to have multiple radio stations, each with their own studio. However, a clear area does not suggest any kind of building or infrastructure, making it the unlikely option where a radio studio could be found.
gain speed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the round object is rolling down a ramp, and the question asks what will happen to it. One common physical phenomenon associated with a rolling object on a slope is that it gains speed as it moves downhill due to gravity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
automobile | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a rock hitting a windshield while on a highway, which suggests that the person was driving a land vehicle. "Motorboat" and "airplane" are water and air-based vehicles respectively, and "barrier" is not a type of vehicle at all. "Motor vehicle" is a more general term that could include automobiles, but "automobile" is the more specific and appropriate choice in this context.
hot | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the pool party was a way to "beat" something, suggesting that it was a solution to a problem. It then goes on to describe the party as a way to "entertain," implying that it was a social event. Together, these clues suggest that the problem being "beaten" is something related to discomfort or discomfort caused by heat. Therefore, the correct answer is "hot." The other options do not make sense in this context.
ground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the speaker goes outside and looks down, they are likely to see the ground. The other options (sun, sky, nature) are all located higher up in the sky and would not necessarily be visible by looking downwards. The option "street" could potentially be a correct answer if the speaker is standing on a street or sidewalk, but the phrasing of the sentence suggests that they are simply stepping outside and looking down.
use gas | Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to your car when you're driving to work. Since driving requires fuel to power the engine, the most likely answer is "use gas." The other options don't necessarily relate to the act of driving, but rather the consequences of it (i.e. getting to work, feeling stressed, receiving a speeding ticket, or experiencing depreciation over time).
tall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that regular pants may not fit properly if a person is very something, and one of the choices that fits this context is "tall." Being tall means having a greater height than average, and this could result in pants being too short. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
disinterest | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally cannot return John's feelings, suggesting that she does not have romantic interest in him. "Disinterest" means a lack of interest or enthusiasm, which fits with Sally's feelings towards John. The other options, such as "being mean" or "negligence," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
sleeping | Knowledge: The sentence states that John slept on a mat along with other children, implying that he is currently sleeping. The other options do not provide any relevant information about John's location or activity.
damaged | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the holy artifact is fragile and requires careful handling. The word "transporting" suggests that the object is being moved from one location to another, further emphasizing the importance of preventing any damage during the journey. The option "halibut" is completely unrelated and can be eliminated. While "profane" and "common" may be opposite in meaning to "holy," neither of them indicates that the object is fragile or requires careful handling. "Broken" is a possibility, but "damaged" is a more general term that covers a wider range of potential harm.
cupboard | Knowledge: Tin is often used to package and store food items such as canned goods, which are commonly kept in cupboards or cabinets in the kitchen. The other options do not make sense for storing tin as they are not typically associated with food storage or packaging.
weights | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercising is related to an activity that involves working on something. The use of the word "weights" implies that this is likely referring to weightlifting or strength training, which is a common way for people to exercise and work on building muscle. The other choices do not have any clear connection to exercise or physical activity.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that there is a concern about the fruit staying fresh in the heat. The most logical solution for this problem would be to put the fruit in a place where it can remain cool and preserved, such as a refrigerator. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
plate  | Knowledge: It is customary to serve eggs on a plate for human consumption. The other options, such as a chicken coop or bird's nest, are not realistic choices for serving eggs to people. While a henhouse is where chickens live, it is not where one would serve food to someone. A glass cup is not a suitable dish for serving eggs, unless perhaps they are going to be used in a mixed drink or cocktail.
department store | Knowledge: The phrase "closing sales" suggests that the stores are going out of business, implying that they have had financial difficulties. Department stores are large, multi-purpose retailers that sell a variety of products, which may explain why they are more likely to have higher overhead costs than smaller stores like clothing or grocery stores. Additionally, department stores have been struggling to compete with online retailers in recent years, which may be another reason why many of them have been closing. The other options do not provide any relevant information to support their selection.
music store | Knowledge: The question is asking where you can acquire a French horn to take home, which suggests that the answer must relate to purchasing or borrowing the instrument. Of the options given, the only one that could reasonably involve buying or renting a French horn is a music store. The other options all relate to attending events or classes, which is not necessarily related to acquiring an instrument. Also, the option 'France' is misleading because it states the name of the country as an option, whereas the correct answer would be a store in France.
town | Knowledge: The question asks for something that can be found in a bookstore that is not for sale. Magazines and phone books are both items that are typically sold in bookstores, and carpeting is not typically found in a bookstore. Towns and cities, however, can often be the subject matter of books or may be referenced in books without being tangible items that can be sold. Therefore, town is the correct answer.
apartment | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the roommates are young and irresponsible, which suggests that they may not have good cleaning habits or keep a tidy living space. An apartment is a common living space for roommates, and the other options such as table, office, desk, and closet do not have the same connotation of being a shared residential space that is prone to becoming messy.
serving time | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of being caught as a criminal. "Serving time" refers to the punishment of being sentenced to a certain amount of time in jail or prison. The other options do not make sense in this context - a criminal would not feel happy about being caught or take money (which would be considered theft) and arming themselves would only lead to further trouble with the law. "Realising error of ways" is a possible answer, but it is not a specific consequence that is always associated with being caught as a criminal.
gaining weight | Knowledge: Overeating generally leads to an increase in calorie intake, which can cause a person to gain weight over time. Hamburger, being a high-calorie food, when overeaten, can cause a significant weight gain. A stomach ache is a more immediate consequence that may occur after eating a lot of hamburger, but it is not necessarily a long-term consequence. Getting full is a normal response to eating and is not negative. Losing weight is the opposite of the expected consequence of overeating hamburger. Death is an extreme consequence that is not relevant to the context of the question.
uncertainty | Knowledge: The word "checkup for followup" suggests that this is a medical appointment that is occurring after something else, likely a previous checkup or medical event. The word "uncertainty" suggests that there is still some question or concern that needs to be addressed, which is why the person is having a follow-up checkup. The other options do not necessarily indicate a reason for a checkup for follow-up, as they could apply to a range of different medical situations.
being over age 21 | Knowledge: In the United States, it is illegal to purchase beer if you are under the age of 21. Therefore, proof of age is required to purchase beer, which is typically in the form of a government-issued ID such as a driver's license or passport. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
increasing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the construction of a new entertainment complex was going to have a negative impact on the budget. The use of the word "costs" implies that expenses related to the project were increasing or adding up, which is supported by the use of the word "but." The other options do not accurately reflect the situation presented in the sentence.
looking pretty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Grumpy is grooming himself because he wants to improve his appearance. The phrase "looking pretty" directly refers to appearance and is the most appropriate choice among the options given. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or have any association with improving one's appearance.
carry | Knowledge: The context of the question is related to groceries, which implies that the vehicle would be used to transport them. The word "carry" is the closest in meaning to transporting or moving something from one place to another, which would be the primary function of a vehicle in this context. The other options do not make sense in relation to groceries, as they either involve physical actions that cannot be performed by a vehicle (eating), or negative outcomes that would not be desirable (feeling the impact of an accident, slowing down).
person's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog lived with a woman, which indicates that the dog was a pet and likely lived in the woman's house rather than a dog house. The option "basket" may seem like a possible answer, but it is unlikely that a dog would live permanently in a basket. Canada and Illinois are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
maintopmast | Knowledge: The word "maintopmast" refers to a specific part of a sailing ship and has no connection to the context of a video. The other options all relate to aspects of a video that may not be the primary focus, such as characters who have smaller roles or elements that are considered secondary or peripheral to the main story or action.
momentum | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is having a hard time getting started on her work, which is often connected to lacking momentum. Momentum is a force that helps us move forward with a consistent pace, and when we lack it, we may experience difficulties or have a hard time starting. Panic, excitement, and accomplishment all suggest different emotional states that are not directly related to the idea of struggling to begin work, while computer is not connected to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: Wheat fields are commonly found in rural or agricultural areas, and the term "countryside" specifically refers to areas outside of cities and towns that are characterized by open fields and natural landscapes. "Mill" and "bread" are related to wheat, but do not necessarily indicate an area in which wheat fields are concentrated. "Eat cake" is unrelated and "farmer's field" is too general to infer a specific crop or location.
being found out | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Boris is being dishonest with Natasha about how she looks in the dress. The phrase "but look far" is likely a typo and should read "butt look fat." Given Boris's dishonesty and desire to avoid something, it is likely that he is afraid of being found out or caught in his lie. The other options (being fired, trouble, hurt feelings, overweight) do not make sense in this context.
spherical | Knowledge: The use of a compass to draw a ball suggests that the drawing would have a precise and symmetrical shape. The term "spherical" specifically refers to a three-dimensional object that is perfectly round, which would best describe a ball that has been accurately drawn using a compass. The other options ("continuous motion", "rolling down street", "circular", and "round") do not accurately describe the shape of a drawn ball, as they lack the precision and accuracy that would result from using a compass.
supermarket | Knowledge: A well-stocked aisle is most commonly associated with a store or supermarket that sells goods. The other options, such as a church, car wash or sanctuary, do not have aisles that would typically be referred to as "well-stocked". A building is a general term that could refer to any type of structure and does not provide enough context to determine where well-stocked aisles might be found.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence implies that small pats of butter are commonly found in a specific location, suggesting that it is a common item in that context. While butter can certainly be found in refrigerators, pastry, and fridges, these options do not specify the size or form of the butter, making them less likely to be the correct answer. The inclusion of "inside a mammoth's handbag" is clearly a joke and can be eliminated as an option. The most appropriate answer is thus "restaurant," where small pats of butter are often provided with bread or other dishes.
turn on | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man wanted to listen to the radio, which suggests that it was initially turned off. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn on." The other options (play music, train, blaring, radiotracking) do not accurately describe what the man did to the radio to be able to listen to it.
excitement | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that this is the person's first job, which suggests that they may be experiencing feelings of excitement and anticipation. Starting a new job can be a significant and positive milestone in someone's life, so it's more likely that he is excited rather than feeling panic, stress, or simply resting. The option "working" is not a feeling, but rather an action that will come after starting the job.
having fun  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a reason why children enjoy jumping rope, which is unlikely to be related to physiological processes such as an increased heart rate or sweating. While those physical effects may be caused by jumping rope, they are not likely to be the primary motivator for why children enjoy the activity. "Smiling" is a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to explain why children enjoy jumping rope. Therefore, "having fun" is the best answer because it directly relates to the enjoyment that children experience from this activity.
success | Knowledge: The word "look forward to" suggests a positive outcome, and the context of opening a business implies that the goal is to be successful. Opening a business is often associated with hopes and aspirations for success, rather than stress, failure, or bankruptcy. "Cash" could be a factor in success, but it is not the ultimate goal.
musical instrument store | Knowledge: The other options, such as stealing a flute or finding one in a marching band, are not ethical or practical ways to obtain a flute. Orchestras and symphonies may have flutes, but they are typically reserved for members of the ensemble. A musical instrument store, on the other hand, is a place where one can buy or rent a variety of musical instruments, including flutes. Therefore, the correct answer is musical instrument store.
hate | Knowledge: The word "killing" suggests intentional and unjustified taking of a human life, which is categorized as murder. The reason why people commit this crime varies from person to person, but one common motivation for murder is hate or anger towards the victim. The other options, such as sporting events or feeling remorse, do not align with the severity and intentionality of murder.
gaining weight | Knowledge: Eating an unhealthy meal typically means consuming a high number of calories, sugar, and/or unhealthy fats. This excess intake can cause the body to store the extra energy as fat, leading to weight gain over time. Gas, indigestion, and getting full are all possible side effects of eating a large meal, but they are not directly related to weight gain. Electrical circuit is not relevant to the context of the question.
retribution | Knowledge: The word "retribution" refers to punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act. In this context, it suggests that the person committed the killing as a form of revenge or retaliation for something that was done to them, making it the most likely answer. "Investigation," "disease," and "going to jail" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "punishment" is a possibility but not as specific as "retribution."
doctor's office | Knowledge: The sentence mentions an examination table, which is typically found in a medical setting. The fact that Bobby is happy this is a simple procedure and that he doesn't have to stay overnight suggests that it's a routine medical check-up or appointment, rather than an emergency or serious illness. The hospital and vet's office options might be plausible, but the language of the sentence suggests a human patient rather than an animal. The school and obituary options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
have sex | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a difference in behavior between happy and unhappy couples when it comes to a certain activity. The answer choice "have sex" is the only one that directly relates to this activity, and it makes sense that happy couples would engage in it more often than unhappy couples. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
walkie talkie | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sally was attempting to communicate using a device that required knowledge of morse code. A walkie talkie is a two-way radio that does not require knowledge of morse code to use. The other options, such as telegram, telegraph, organ, and motor do not involve communication through verbal or textual means, nor do they require knowledge of morse code.
report for duty | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Brian was a soldier and has received the news that he was called back to active service, meaning he would have to report for duty soon. The other options may be related to being a soldier, but they do not accurately reflect the immediate action that Brian would need to take upon being called back to active service.
grocery store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to shopping or carrying items in a bag. A grocery store is a common place to use a paper bag for carrying purchases, while a synagogue, classroom, lunchbox, and front porch are not typically associated with this activity.
tension | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people have differing viewpoints, it can lead to a negative effect on their relationship. The word "tension" is often used to describe an uncomfortable or strained atmosphere between people. The other options, such as enemies or battle, suggest a more extreme or aggressive outcome, which may not be the case in all situations.
China shop | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man is looking for a specific type of bowl for cereal, indicating that he may want a quality product that can hold his cereal without spilling. China shops typically sell high-quality dishes, including bowls that could be used for cereal. The kitchen cabinet and cupboard options would involve looking for a bowl within his home, which may not be a viable option if he does not already have a spare bowl. The cereal box option is not logical since it contains cereal, not a bowl.
cup  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thirsty and wants to drink some coffee. To consume a liquid, most people would use a cup, which is a vessel designed to hold liquids. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dining room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker went to a party at a friend's house, which implies a more casual setting than a restaurant or mall counter. Additionally, sharing a meal typically takes place in a designated eating area, such as a dining room, rather than a shopping area or big city.
ascending | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoys going down, which implies that he doesn't enjoy going up. This eliminates options such as loss of oxygen, blisters, and vertigo, which are all physical ailments that can occur during climbing regardless of which direction one is going. Getting a snack is also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be ascending, which is the direct opposite of going down.
harmony | Knowledge: The phrase "agreeing with each other" suggests that the people in question are in a state of agreement or accord. The word "harmony" also means a state of agreement or congruity, so it is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not necessarily indicate agreement, such as "rapport" which refers to a positive interpersonal relationship and "band together" which means to unite for a common purpose. "Smiles" could suggest agreement but it is not a defining characteristic, while "tears" suggests the opposite of agreement.
air | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that birds are located on a "statute," which is likely a typo for "statue." Birds are not typically found on statues that are located in the countryside or in city hall buildings. Parks do have statues and may have birds, but the sentence specifically asks where birds are on a statue, not in a park. The only logical option left is "air," which is where birds can fly and perch on statues.
construction site | Knowledge: Explosive devices are commonly used in construction sites for building and demolishing structures. They are particularly useful in cases where traditional demolition methods may not be practical due to safety or space constraints. While bombs and explosives are also associated with the military and war, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on their use in a non-violent setting. The options "army" and "war" are therefore less likely to be correct. "Workplace" could be a possible answer, but it is more general and does not specifically relate to the use of explosive devices.
fast food restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hamburger patties were frozen from being exposed to some external factor. Given that the other options (except for "made from beef") describe potential locations where one might eat a hamburger, it is most likely that the exposure occurred at a fast food restaurant. These types of establishments often prepare and freeze their hamburger patties in advance, increasing the likelihood of them becoming frozen due to overexposure.
pain | Knowledge: The word "tragedy" implies that something bad happened, and the use of the word "remembering" suggests that it occurred in the past. "Pain" is a common emotion that people feel when reflecting on difficult or traumatic events, while "depression" may suggest a longer-term mood disorder rather than a natural response to a specific event. "Nostalgia" and "knowing" are not necessarily associated with negative experiences or emotions.
parent | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a child requires the presence of someone to take care of them, suggesting that the answer is a person or group of people. The most common caregivers for a child are typically their parents, as they are responsible for nurturing and supporting their child's growth and development. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not describe a caregiver role.
outside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small dog needs to relieve itself, which would typically require going outside. Dogs are commonly trained to do their business outside, either in a backyard or on a walk. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
transportation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving is a common way for people to move from one place to another, which is a characteristic commonly associated with transportation. Traffic jams and accidents may be negative aspects of driving, but they do not describe the purpose or function of driving. Moving may involve a variety of methods, such as walking, using public transportation, or hiring a moving company, so it does not accurately reflect the popularity of driving as a personal mode of transportation. Status may be a reason why some people choose to drive, but it is not the most widely recognized aspect of personal transportation.
park | Knowledge: The sentence implies that squirrels can be found in abundance outside of cities, and specifically mentions a location where they can be found. Parks are common areas where wildlife can be found, including squirrels. Forests can also be home to many animals, but the sentence specifies "outside of the city," which suggests a more urban location like a park. Yards may have squirrels but not in great numbers and only in residential areas. Streets and deserts are unlikely places to find squirrels.
forbid | Knowledge: The use of the word "let" indicates that the woman allowed her son to play with something in his room, so options like prohibit and disallow can be eliminated as they suggest the opposite action of not allowing something. Annoy is a possibility, but it doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence. Stop is also a possibility, but it doesn't convey the sense of disallowing something that forbid does. Therefore, forbid is the best choice.
outside | Knowledge: The term "weasel" is often used to describe a sneaky or devious person, so it's unlikely that a human Weasel would be found in a government building or a children's song. A "chicken coop" seems too specific for a human to be hiding in, and "Congress" is too vague. "Outside" is the most general option and could encompass a wide variety of locations where a person might try to hide or be sneaky.
own house | Knowledge: The word "cozy" suggests a comfortable, warm, and intimate environment, which is typically associated with one's own house. Eating in one's own house can provide a sense of familiarity and relaxation that may not be found in a public space like downtown, prison, or city. The inclusion of "earing" is likely a typo and does not make sense in the sentence.
picnic basket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Picnic baskets are often associated with carrying food and drinks for outdoor activities, making it the most likely option. A wine press is used for making wine and a box is too general without any specific details about what the grapes are for. The fruit cocktail and kitchen options are also not related to carrying a bunch of grapes.
street corner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the car was experiencing mechanical issues, specifically overheating. The fact that it was located on a street corner implies that it had likely broken down and was unable to continue driving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
enjoyment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that riding a bike along the pathway on the beach brought a positive experience. The words "peacefully cruising along" also indicate a calm and enjoyable activity. The options "falling down" and "anger" suggest negative experiences, while "get somewhere" implies a utilitarian purpose rather than a leisurely activity. "Pleasure" is similar to "enjoyment" but not as specific to the context of the sentence. Therefore, "enjoyment" is the best answer.
Disneyland | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a magical kingdom that becomes miserable when it rains, which is a clue to the answer. Disneyland is a well-known theme park that is often associated with magic and whimsy, and it is located in Southern California, where it rarely rains. When it does rain, the park may not be as enjoyable due to the outdoor nature of many of the attractions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fresh fish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monger removed a bone in preparation for serving something. Out of the given choices, only fresh fish is a common food that would require the removal of bones. Octopus is typically served whole or in large pieces, and would not require bone removal. Skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth are all inappropriate choices for food.
embarrassment | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that expressing oneself in a public forum may lead to a negative experience. "Danger" and "getting arrested" seem unlikely if the expression is lawful and respectful. "Blank stares" may be a possibility, but is not a negative outcome. "Stage fright" is a possibility, but does not necessarily involve expressing oneself in a negative light. "Embarrassment," however, is a common negative experience that may arise from expressing oneself in a way that is not well received by the public.
fitness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that running after balls has a positive effect on one's body. "Fitness" is a commonly associated benefit with physical activity, such as running, while "sweating" and "physical exertion" are outcomes of the activity rather than benefits. "Catching up with" and "sprinting" are more specific actions rather than general outcomes.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was trying to cool off on a hot summer day, which is often done for the purpose of relaxation. Swimming or sitting in a pool can help to reduce body temperature and provide a break from the heat, which may explain why James was doing it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bowling alley | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects," which is a clear reference to the sport of bowling. Bowling alleys are specifically designed for this sport, and they often have bars or restaurants where patrons can enjoy a beer while playing. The other options, such as a hockey game or croquet, do not involve throwing heavy spheres or white objects, and the option of a fridge does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: A sporting goods store is a typical place to purchase a baseball. The other options, such as America, a park, a sandbox, or breaking a window, do not make sense in this context as they do not relate to how to acquire a baseball.
tornado | Knowledge: The phrase "torn to shreds" refers to a destructive force that has the ability to break down a large object into many small pieces. Additionally, the phrase "one projectile after another flying through the air" suggests a swirling motion that is typical of a tornado. A tornado is a powerful and destructive weather phenomenon that can easily tear through buildings and cause debris to fly through the air. The other options, such as "weapon," "baseball," "air," and "cannon," do not fit the context and would not be able to explain the destructive force described in the sentence.
intellectual stimulation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person found the math class to be uninteresting, which suggests that they were seeking something else from the class besides a basic level of understanding. The option "intellectual stimulation" is directly related to the sentence, as it suggests that the person wanted to be intellectually engaged by the class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
construct | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally took a break from hard work by going on vacation and doing an activity that involves building. Sand castles are typically constructed and built, which makes "construct" the most appropriate option. "Faster" and "working" do not make sense in the context of building a sand castle, while "piece together" and "put together" imply that the castle was already in some state of completion before Sally began her activity, which is not indicated in the sentence.
new experiences | Knowledge: The question asks for a characteristic of a healthy person, which suggests traits or behaviors that contribute to physical or mental well-being. While none of the options are inherently incorrect or impossible, the most likely choice is "new experiences," as engaging in novel, stimulating activities has been linked to positive mood, improved cognitive functioning, and other markers of health. Depression, on the other hand, is a mental health issue that indicates the opposite of a desirable characteristic. Owning a house or being good looking are not necessarily indicative of overall health, while playfulness may be a positive trait, but not necessarily a core characteristic of health.
leave home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary's animal friend needs to be on a leash when doing a certain activity. The only choice that fits this context is "leave home," as animals on leashes are often taken outside of the house for walks or other outings. The other options are not related to the concept of leash-walking.
warm bed | Knowledge: The word "grumpy" suggests that this cat would prefer a comfortable, cozy spot to curl up and be left alone. A warm bed is a common place for cats to nap, and the word "warm" implies that it is a comfortable spot. The other options, such as a sandbox or a shelf, do not suggest a comfortable or cozy environment for a grumpy cat.
hospital | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer needed dental treatment, which is typically provided in a hospital or dental clinic setting. The other options - michigan, pub, town, and street - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
capillaries | Knowledge: Blood travels throughout the body via a network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries. Capillaries are the smallest of these vessels, and they are responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues and organs. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
apartment | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Simon brought his computer to his living space, as he mentioned going up the stairs and setting it up by the sofa. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, such as a classroom, park, school, or demonstration.
fights | Knowledge: Becoming inebriated often refers to becoming drunk, which can impair judgment, coordination, and impulse control. This can lead to aggressive, harmful, or reckless behavior, such as getting into fights. Addiction, arrest, and paralysis are less common outcomes of becoming inebriated. Staggering may occur as a physical symptom of intoxication, but it is not a consequence that someone would "get into."
roof | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the newspaper boy needs to protect the paper from the rain. The best option for this would be to place the paper on the roof of the recipient's home, where it would be protected from the rain. The other options, such as the library or the lawn, do not provide any clear protection from the rain. The trash also does not make sense, as it suggests that the newspaper should be thrown away in the rain. The front door could provide some protection, but placing the paper on the roof would be the most effective option.
social activism | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the group is actively working towards changing society in a significant way, which is a definition commonly associated with social activism. Social activism involves engaging in actions or campaigns that aim to influence social or political change. Voting and arguing alone may not necessarily lead to radical societal change, while dancers are not relevant to the question and social disruption has a negative connotation.
big house | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the space being described has room for multiple bedrooms, an office, a study, and a playroom. This suggests that it is a large and spacious living area, as a small house would not have enough room for all of these separate areas. Building is too vague, and nursery school and preschool are not consistent with the context provided.
frying pan | Knowledge: Frying pans are often used in cooking and can become very hot, which is why they typically have a handle to make them easier to hold and maneuver while cooking. The other options, such as carrying things, a coffee cup, an iron, or a briefcase, do not typically have hot handles.
hurt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being rescued is behaving aggressively towards the paramedics. In this situation, the paramedics may need to defend themselves, and unfortunately, that may involve "hurting" the person in order to protect themselves and complete the rescue. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the paramedics' need to protect themselves.
promotion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thinking about the pros and cons of extra responsibilities and benefits that come with a certain achievement or change in their career. Given the context, the most likely choice is promotion. Driving to work suggests that the person is employed and looking to advance in their career. The other choices don't make sense in this context.
frustration | Knowledge: The phrase "wet match" suggests that the match is damp or moist, which means that it will not light easily. This is because the moisture can prevent the match from igniting, and can also put out the flame if the match does light. Therefore, attempting to light a wet match is more likely to result in frustration rather than any of the other options suggested.
doze off | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is one specific action that is considered the "worst thing" to do while driving. From a safety perspective, dozing off or falling asleep while driving is extremely dangerous and can result in serious accidents. The other options such as "getting somewhere" or "using gas" are not inherently dangerous while driving, while "listening to others" is not specific enough to the context and "speeding ticket" refers to a consequence of bad driving, rather than the action itself.
closet | Knowledge: The question is asking about the best place to store shoes, which suggests that the answer should be a location where shoes can be organized and kept out of the way when not in use. A closet is a common location for storing shoes as it allows for easy organization and access, while keeping them hidden away from the rest of the living space. The other options do not provide an adequate solution for shoe storage.
hardware store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James needs a new hammer, which is a common tool found in hardware stores. Hardware stores typically carry a wide range of tools, including hammers, and are a common place to buy tools for household or DIY projects. While a repair shop or tool shop could potentially have hammers, they are not as commonly associated with selling these types of tools. A carpenter's toolbox or personal tool box may not have a new hammer readily available, as these are typically stored with the owner's personal tools.
amnesia | Knowledge: The question is asking about the result of getting a blackout from amnesia, which suggests a loss of memory. Amnesia is a condition where a person experiences memory loss, which could result in a blackout. The other options do not relate to the concept of memory loss, making them incorrect choices.
tool box | Knowledge: A screw is a small, metal fastener commonly used in woodworking. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the missing screw would be found in a place where woodworking tools and materials are stored. The tool box is a common storage location for screws, while the other options have no connection to woodworking or screws.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman did not fulfill her dream of owning a house in the countryside and instead settled for a cramped apartment. The word "city" provides a clear contrast to the dream of living in the countryside, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. "Street" and "residential area" could refer to a variety of locations, while "ghetto" and "subdivision" have negative and positive connotations respectively, which are not implied in the sentence.
unclear | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were having difficulty understanding the words being spoken, which implies that the words were not clear or were not presented in a comprehensible manner. This rules out options such as "hurt people" and "hurtful," which suggest a negative or harmful intent behind the words. "Mean many things" also does not fit the context, as it suggests a broad range of interpretations rather than confusion. "Hurt feelings" is close in meaning to "unclear," but the latter is a more accurate descriptor of the situation presented.
fight for life | Knowledge: The word "predicament" suggests a difficult or challenging situation, in which an animal might need to protect itself. The option "fight for life" is the most appropriate response, as it implies that the animal is facing a life-threatening situation and might need to use aggression to protect itself. The other options do not necessarily relate to survival in a dangerous circumstance.
jar | Knowledge: Peanut butter is commonly sold in jars, which are typically made of glass or plastic and have a screw-on lid for easy opening and closing. The other options, such as cupboard and pantry, are places where you might store peanut butter once it's been opened and transferred to a different container. A bottle would be an unusual choice for peanut butter packaging, and supermarkets are places where you can buy peanut butter, but they are not the specific container that it comes in.
turmoil | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite a desire for peace, there were difficulties in rebuilding and a sense of instability or upheaval. Turmoil means a state of great disturbance, confusion or uncertainty, and is a suitable word to describe the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sense of unrest and uncertainty conveyed by the context of the sentence.
open doors | Knowledge: The question asks about what cats could do if they were taller. Cats, being intelligent creatures, might be able to do certain things if they were tall enough to reach or grasp objects that they cannot currently reach, such as opening doors. The other choices - annoy, eat meat, need food, and jog - either do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or have no direct relation to a cat's ability to be taller.
wooded area | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the snake was seeking cover from predators that may be above ground, which suggests that it was seeking shelter under some sort of overhead cover. A wooded area would provide ample opportunity for the snake to seek shelter under branches and leaves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as a tropical forest or warm place may not provide enough overhead cover and a canyon or sleeping bag do not seem like feasible options for a snake seeking cover.
educate students | Knowledge: The other options are not likely to contribute to someone being a good teacher. Teaching to the test may help students perform well on exams, but it does not necessarily foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Vacations are important for rest and rejuvenation, but they do not directly impact teaching ability. Interested students may be easier to teach, but it does not guarantee that the teacher is effective. Students learning is the goal of teaching, not a factor that contributes to being a good teacher.
pet shop | Knowledge: Hermit crabs are commonly sold as pets in pet shops, making this the most likely answer. Fishmongers sell fish, not hermit crabs, and the intertidal zone and tidepools are natural habitats where hermit crabs might be found but not taken home. The ocean is too vast to pinpoint a specific location to take home a hermit crab.
a gift | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the subject is showing respect for another person, and the question is asking what action they could take to demonstrate that respect. Out of the given choices, the most appropriate response would be to give them a gift as a token of appreciation. The other options (slight, irreverence, disregard, and belittlement) would be disrespectful and inappropriate.
catch cold | Knowledge: Getting wet can lower the body temperature and weaken the immune system, making it more susceptible to catching a cold or other respiratory infections. Skin rash and dilution are not common results of getting wet, while melting is an absurd option. Feeling cold is a natural response to being wet but it is not necessarily a consequence of it.
lower standards | Knowledge: Alcohol consumption can impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading individuals to make choices they may not make if they were sober. This can include choosing to engage in sexual activity with someone they may not typically find attractive or approve of. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for this behavior, and may not be related to alcohol consumption.
indifferent | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the previous facility had staff who were not attentive to the needs of the elderly residents, as evidenced by their lethargic behavior. The word "indifferent" means lacking in interest or concern, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "neglect" and "disregard," imply intentional harm or neglect, which is not suggested by the sentence. "Manual" does not make sense in the context of staffing for an elderly care facility.
act | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people with chocolate in their pockets will do something as a result. The word "act" is the most logical option because it is the most general and could encompass any action that a person might take after finding chocolate in their pocket. The other options (transcend reality, read newspapers, experience spirituality, and melt) do not make sense in this context and do not seem related to the idea of having chocolate in one's pockets.
tiredness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that doing housework all day is likely to result in a physical feeling. The options "boredom" and "getting a clean house" are not physical feelings, while "backache" may be a result of lifting or strenuous activity during housework, but it is not the most likely outcome. "Tiredness" and "getting tired" are similar options, but "tiredness" is a more definitive response as it describes a feeling of exhaustion or fatigue that comes from extended physical activity.
annoying or noisy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jenny does not like children, which may indicate that she is annoyed or bothered by their behavior. Yelling, annoying, and noisy are all negative behaviors that children may exhibit that could exacerbate Jenny's feelings toward them. Curious and innocent are neutral or positive traits that may not necessarily impact Jenny's dislike of children.
fridge | Knowledge: The question suggests that the meat is not going to be used immediately and needs to be stored properly to prevent spoilage. Freezing is an option for long-term storage, but the question specifies that it needs to be used soon, so the freezer is not the best answer. Butcher shop and frying pan are not options for storing meat. The counter is not a good choice either, as it can lead to bacterial growth if the meat is left at room temperature for too long. The fridge is the most appropriate answer for storing meat that needs to be used soon, as it will slow down bacterial growth and keep the meat fresh for a few more days.
drug store | Knowledge: The word "rubber" in this context refers to a condom, which is a form of contraception used during sexual activity. Condoms are typically sold in drug stores, as well as other places like supermarkets, convenience stores, and health clinics. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James tripped over something in the house, which implies that the toys were on the floor where he was running. Additionally, his mother had warned him to put his toys away, indicating that they were likely scattered on the floor rather than neatly stored in a drawer or a basement. The options "slippery" and "store" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Chess set | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the location of a knight in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, rather than a literal one. In this case, a knight is most commonly associated with the game of chess, where it is one of the playing pieces. The other options, such as middle ages, historical novel, castle, and guarding the king, do not fit the context of the sentence as they all refer to literal locations or historical periods.
awe inspiring | Knowledge: The phrase "large fluffy clouds" suggests that the clouds have a visually pleasing and impressive appearance which can often evoke feelings of wonder or amazement in people who observe them. The option "blanket" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, "cause rain to fall" and "bring rain" suggests that the clouds are responsible for precipitation which is not mentioned in the sentence, and "rain water" is not a suggested effect of observing the clouds.
get things done | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the woman completed her errands right away, suggesting that she has a preference for efficiency and productivity. The phrase "get things done" directly relates to this idea of being productive and completing tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
container | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person forgot to put a lid on a container, likely a garbage can, and that raccoons were able to knock all of the garbage out. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Composted" implies that the garbage was being turned into compost, which is not mentioned. "Nice aroma" suggests the garbage smelled good, which is not the case in the sentence. "Smell terrible" and "smells bad" describe the smell of the garbage, but do not indicate what the raccoons knocked it out of.
anxiety | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was worried about performing, which is commonly associated with anxiety. Anxiety can be characterized by feelings of worry, nervousness, or unease about an upcoming event, which is consistent with the context of the sentence. The other options such as injury, action, lightning or fear do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fight each other | Knowledge: The word "meet" suggests that the animals are encountering each other for the first time, and given the range of options, it is likely that there will be some sort of interaction or reaction. "Procreate" would only occur if the animals were of the opposite sex and willing to mate. "Sleep" and "live lives" are too general and could happen regardless of whether animals meet or not. "Listen to each other" might occur in some cases, but it is less likely than animals fighting each other to establish dominance.
fair  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge was doing his job on his bench, and the most important principle related to his job would be the idea of being fair. Being fair is a foundational principle of serving justice, thus marking it as the most important principle. The other options - honest, lawyer, arranging files, and telling the truth - do not relate directly to the idea of serving justice, and hence do not qualify as the answer.
book or magazine | Knowledge: A story in print can refer to a work of fiction or non-fiction that is published in a physical format such as a book or a magazine. Bookstores are a common place to find books, while schools may have textbooks or novels for students to read. Newspapers typically contain news articles and not fiction or longer-form stories. The option "past" does not make sense in this context as it is not a physical location or item where stories can be found.
satisfaction | Knowledge: Eating is usually done to satisfy hunger and provide the body with necessary nutrients to maintain health. The other options, such as dyspepsia and indigestion, are negative outcomes from overeating or eating unhealthy foods. To gloat does not relate to the act of eating, and gaining weight may be a consequence of frequent overeating but is not a reason someone would want to eat.
music class | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the learner is looking for a formal setting to learn how to play a french horn. While one could potentially find resources and guidance in other settings, such as a music store or concert hall, a music class is a dedicated space for learning and instruction. France may be associated with the instrument due to its name, but it is not a relevant answer for where to learn how to play it. On top of a mountain is clearly an absurd choice and can be eliminated.
basketball | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the half court boundary and 3 pointers, which are specific to the game of basketball. The other options have no relation to the context of the sentence.
soda pop | Knowledge: The sentence states that sugar is a main ingredient, which implies that it is being used as a sweetener in a food or beverage. Candy bars and tea often contain sugar, but water is not a typical ingredient in either. Coffee may be sweetened with sugar, but it is not a main ingredient. Cupboard is not a food or beverage, so it can be eliminated as an option. Therefore, soda pop, which is known to contain high amounts of sugar, is the most likely answer.
backyard | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a place where they can fire up a grill, which is typically done outdoors. The options "restaurant" and "kitchen" do not make sense in this context, as those are indoor spaces where grilling would not typically occur. "Park" could be a possible option, but the use of the word "out" suggests that the speaker is already outside, so they would not need to go to a park to grill. Therefore, the best answer would be "backyard," which is a common outdoor space for grilling.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Steve asked people for a place to stay, which implies that he is likely staying with someone he knows. The options "apartment" and "tent" do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply that Steve found a place to stay on his own. The option "outside" is unlikely because it suggests Steve would be sleeping outdoors, which is not a common or safe option. The option "living room" is a possibility, but the most likely answer is "friend's house" since it is common for people to offer a spare room or couch to a friend in need.
destroy enemy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's goal was to completely destroy the town, which is often a tactic used in war to weaken the enemy. In this context, "reducing to rubble" means destroying completely. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not align with the man's actions of hate and destruction.
row boat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a child is learning a specific skill related to a lake. The option "row boat" is the most specific skill related to being on a lake, as it involves using oars to move a small boat through the water. The other options, such as becoming an adult, starting school, or driving, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Go out to play" is a more general option that could fit, but it is not as specific as "row boat."
rest area | Knowledge: The context suggests that David had the map with him at some point but cannot recall where he put it. The last time he remembers having it was at a rest stop where he had also taken out his toothbrush. Therefore, it is likely that the map is still at the rest area where he had stopped to brush his teeth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cabinet | Knowledge: Chess boards are typically kept in a cabinet when not in use to protect the pieces and keep them organized. Keeping a chess board in a house is too general and does not specify where in the house it would be kept. Likewise, keeping it in a basement or retirement community is not specific enough or applicable to all situations. Keeping it in a toy store does not make sense as it is not a place where one would typically keep personal items.
intermission | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described involves a performance at a theater, likely a play or musical. The phrase "part way through" suggests that the performance was interrupted temporarily. An intermission is a common pause in live performances that allows the audience to take a break, use the restroom, and purchase refreshments. "Spending money" and "being entertained" are too vague and do not relate directly to the context of the sentence. "Sleepiness" is unrelated and "man of la mancha" is a specific reference that does not fit the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: A small folding knife is often carried in a pocket for convenience and easy access. The other options do not make sense in the context of carrying a knife, as they are not locations where a knife would typically be stored or used. A kitchen drawer might contain a larger knife used for cooking, a fishing boat might have specialized knives for cleaning fish, and a garbage bag and table are not relevant to the question.
library | Knowledge: A library is a common place to find newspapers, especially if you are looking for a specific title. Many libraries keep archives of newspapers on microfilm or in digital format, and they may also have physical copies available for borrowing or viewing within the library. Magazine articles and archives may contain information about the newspaper, but they are not a direct source for obtaining a specific title. Safe deposit boxes are typically used for storing valuable items such as jewelry or important documents, and a page is a part of a book or document, not a location for obtaining a newspaper.
hollywood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is not about finding an actual star in the sky, but rather a celebrity that is famous and well-known. Since the other options do not have any relevance to the world of entertainment or celebrities, the answer must be "hollywood" which is a famous location known for being the center of the movie industry and the place where many celebrities live and work.
It could be any of the options, but friend's house, neighbor's house, or grandmas house are the most likely answers. | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is in an unfamiliar kitchen and needs to ask for the location of spoons, which implies that they are in a place where they do not usually go. Fraternity houses and restaurants may not be places where the speaker has access to the kitchen or utensils, making them less likely options. While it is possible that the speaker could be in a restaurant, the use of the word "informally" suggests a casual setting, making a friend's house, neighbor's house, or grandmas house more likely.
mountainous area or in Washington | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bald eagle might be spotted soaring in clear skies. Bald eagles are known to inhabit mountainous areas with clear skies, such as the Rocky Mountains. They are also commonly associated with Washington, as it is the state bird and can often be seen soaring over the state's forests and waterways. The other options, such as a nature preserve, soup, and Colorado, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
procreate | Knowledge: Procreation refers specifically to the act of animals (and humans) reproducing and producing offspring. The other options do not accurately describe the process of reproduction or are unrelated to the question. "Birth" involves the delivery of offspring, rather than the act of producing them. "Reproduce asexually" refers to a type of reproduction that does not involve the combination of genetic material from two parents. "Lie down" and "feel pain" do not have any connection to reproduction.
power engines | Knowledge: Petrol is commonly used as fuel for engines, whether in cars, boats, or other machinery. The phrase "power engines" specifically refers to the use of petrol as a fuel source for engines. Gas stations are places where petrol can be purchased, but they do not use petrol to power anything themselves. "Burn hot" is not a common usage for petrol and does not fit the context of the question. Fuel tanks are containers for holding petrol, but they do not use petrol to power anything. While cars do run on petrol, the question is asking about what petrol is used to power, not what runs on petrol.
make happy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was feeling down and their friends threw them a party to help cheer them up. The phrase "make happy" directly relates to this situation, as it implies that the friends were trying to improve the speaker's mood. Reciprocity, getting drunk, and embarrassing oneself do not fit the context of the sentence. Making money is also unlikely as a motive for this kind of gesture.
take time | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam was not in a hurry while shopping, which allowed him to be more mindful. Being mindful typically involves taking time to pay attention to one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. Therefore, the correct answer is "take time." The other options either do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence or are too similar to the correct answer.
animal shelter | Knowledge: A stray dog is one that has been lost or abandoned and is wandering without a home or owner. Therefore, the most likely place to find a stray dog would be an animal shelter, as they often take in and care for lost or abandoned animals until they can be reunited with their owners or adopted by new families. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to finding a stray dog, as a big house or own home may imply the dog already has an owner, while on a leash implies that the dog already has an owner who is taking them for a walk.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a place where thousands of companies and a rosebush coexist, and the use of the word "home" implies that this place is limited in space and likely associated with a residence. The only option that fits this description is a backyard, which is typically found at residential properties and can accommodate both companies (e.g. home-based businesses) and a rosebush (a common plant found in backyards). The other options don't provide a clear explanation for how both companies and a rosebush can coexist in the same place.
nursing home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog volunteered somewhere, and given the context of spending time with the elderly, a nursing home is the most likely option. Nursing homes are often associated with elderly care and volunteering opportunities, especially for therapy dogs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
nightgown or expensive clothing | Knowledge: The context suggests that Billy bought silk clothing as a gift for his wife, and the options provided suggest different types of silk clothing that he may have purchased. A nightgown suggests a more intimate or personal gift, while expensive clothing suggests a more luxurious or prestigious gift. Chinatown and garments are not specific enough to connect to the context, and sexy could apply to any type of silk clothing, making it too broad of an option.
be still | Knowledge: The sentence describes a friend's leg shaking out of nerves, and the other person grasping it to prevent any further shaking. This suggests that the desired outcome was for the leg to be still. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence or are opposite in meaning to what is being described.
public office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite being a weasel, Bill was someone you would want on your side. This implies that he had a particular skill or ability that made him valuable. Additionally, the phrase "public office" suggests a position of power or influence, which could be useful when trying to gain an advantage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
books | Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific location where one can find information about the anatomy of a blowfish in print. The most likely source of this information would be in a book, as it is a common medium for educational materials. The other choices are not relevant or do not have a clear connection to the subject matter.
toilet | Knowledge: The sentence implies that water is likely to be found in a particular location, and the options provided are all possible locations. However, the context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to plumbing or infrastructure. Toilets are specifically designed to hold and dispose of water, unlike sinks or jars, and are often connected to plumbing that transports water. Bridges and houses may have water sources nearby, but the sentence suggests that the answer should be a specific location inside a building.
hurt feelings  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking to others can improve our emotional state, but if those individuals are mean or hurtful, they can have the opposite effect and cause negative emotions such as hurt feelings. The other options, dry mouth, changing behavior, communicating with others, and anger, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not mentioned as potential outcomes of talking to mean people.
special | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite everyone being ordinary, they are often told that they possess a quality that sets them apart from others. The word "special" fits this context, as it connotes a unique quality that makes someone stand out from the crowd. The other options, such as "ugly" and "strange," do not fit the positive tone of the sentence and are not supported by the context. "Unbelievable" and "exceptional" may be fitting options, but "special" is the most appropriate given the context of the sentence.
rooms | Knowledge: The question implies that something can be added to a building to increase its size. Out of the options given, only "rooms" makes sense as something that can be added to a building. "City", "town", and "urban area" refer to geographic locations, while "fall down" is obviously the opposite of what the question is asking for.
countryside | Knowledge: Rows of apple trees are commonly found in orchards, which are often located in rural areas such as the countryside. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of driving through rows of apple trees. The mountains may have trees, but apple orchards are not commonly found at high altitude. Front yards may have apple trees, but they would not be arranged in rows like in an orchard. Wisconsin and Washington State are known for apple production, but simply being in those states does not necessarily indicate that someone would be driving through rows of apple trees.
lie down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when animals get tired, they do something to rest or take a break. Biting or grooming does not necessarily help them rest, while procreation and keeping alive are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be "lie down," which is a common way animals rest when they are tired.
supermarket | Knowledge: The other options do not typically sell food items, whereas a supermarket is a common place to purchase groceries and snacks like candy. Movies may have a concession stand that sells candy, but it wouldn't typically offer a wide variety of foods. Malls may have food courts and snack stands, but they are not primarily focused on selling grocery items. Jar and television are also not places where people would typically purchase food items.
anxiety | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the claustrophobic person was feeling a certain emotion while getting in line. Claustrophobia is a fear of confined spaces, which can cause anxiety and panic in those who suffer from it. The other options, such as "wait turn" and "late," do not have a direct connection to the claustrophobia described in the sentence. "Nauseous" may be a physical reaction to anxiety, but it is not specific to claustrophobia. "Terrible" is too vague to be a likely answer.
found in stall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the horse had given many rides that day and was likely tired, so it is reasonable to assume that he would have been resting in his stall. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The option "ridden" is incorrect because it doesn't provide an answer to where the horse was found.
expense | Knowledge: The word "practical" suggests that the husband is focused on functionality and cost-effectiveness rather than novelty or adventure. The phrase "house shopping" also implies that the couple is looking to buy a house, which is a major expense. The other choices (arriving, location, excitement, movement) do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
All of the above | Knowledge: A stringed instrument can be heard in a variety of settings, from a classical string quartet in a concert hall or music conservatory, to a rock band on stage, to a music store where instruments are sold and demonstrated, and even in a school music classroom where students may be learning to play. Therefore, all of the options could be correct depending on the context of the question.
own object | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person purchased something with their own money, which indicates that they now own that object. The phrase "have object" also suggests ownership, but the other options ("turn blue", "cross street", "suffer pain") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
clean dishes | Knowledge: The mention of a soapy sponge suggests that the person is intending to clean something. The options "wet surface," "collect water," and "hold water" do not make sense in this context as they do not involve cleaning. Holding the sponge is also unlikely to be the correct answer since the person wants to use it. Therefore, "clean dishes" is the most likely answer as it involves using the soapy sponge for its intended purpose.
write | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is creative and enjoys reading, and on a rainy day, he wants to make something like what he read. This implies that he may try his hand at writing, which is the process of creating written works such as stories, poems, or essays. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
chemistry lab | Knowledge: The word "decanter" is often associated with pouring liquids, and in a chemistry lab, it may be used to transfer chemicals from one container to another. Decanters are also commonly used to aerate wine before drinking, but this answer choice is outside of the scope of the question, as it specifies "outside of drinking alcohol." The kitchen cupboard and restaurant answer choices do not have any clear connection to decanters, while the brewery answer choice specifies alcohol, which is excluded in the question.
water and soap | Knowledge: The sentence implies that washing clothes involves something passing or moving, and that it is related to the process of washing. It is commonly known that soap and water are used to wash clothes, so "soap and water" and "water and soap" are likely options. Air and effort are not directly related to the process of washing clothes, while time is not a physical substance that can "pass" while washing clothes.
spend money | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is hesitant to get food because work has been slow, which suggests that they may be short on money. This would make spending money on lunch an undesirable option. The other choices do not directly relate to the context of the sentence - drinking, beginning work, or eating quickly may not necessarily require spending money, and having lunch is not necessarily an action that one would avoid due to financial concerns.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the character is in someone else's kitchen, based on the phrase "of people who just moved in to town." The most likely place for her to be in this scenario would be at the house of new neighbors. The other options, such as a tree house or a restaurant, do not fit the context of the sentence.
movie | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John likes Disney movies and is looking for something to watch, indicating that he is likely interested in watching a Disney movie. The other options (drawer, cabinet, microwave) do not relate to watching movies and are unlikely to be relevant to the sentence. Disneyland also does not fit as it is a theme park and not a place to watch movies.
lie | Knowledge: The question asks what happens if you agree with someone but do not keep the agreement. "Lie" is the only option that suggests intentional deceit, which would be the case if someone agrees to do something but does not follow through. The other options do not relate to breaking an agreement and are not reasonable choices in this context.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is discussing where to put a lamp in the room where they sleep. Since the lamp is for personal use in the sleeping area, it is most likely meant for the bedroom. The other options, such as desktop, table building, corner, and office, do not fit the context of the sentence and suggest a different location for the lamp.
lawn | Knowledge: Rosebushes are typically planted in areas with well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. A lawn is an ideal location for a rosebush because it provides these conditions while also giving the plant room to grow and spread out. Parks may also be suitable, but the other options (Delaware, planting, and Washington) are not specific enough or relevant to the context of the question.
get to work | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the purpose of driving to work. Out of the options provided, only "get to work" aligns with the goal of driving to work, which is to arrive at one's workplace. The other options are either negative consequences of driving (speeding ticket, anxiety) or unrelated (use gas, go fast).
strip mall | Knowledge: The phrase "along with other such enterprises" suggests that the dime store is located in an area with other businesses of a similar nature. A strip mall is a common type of commercial development that features several small stores or shops in a row, often with a large parking lot in front. This setting would be a likely place to find a dime store, along with other businesses such as discount retailers, dollar stores, and chain restaurants. The other options do not fit the description of a strip mall or other commercial development.
cabinet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the paper towels are regularly kept in a visible location in the kitchen, so the most likely place for the dad to search for them would be another easily accessible location within the same room, such as a cabinet. The other options (pantry, grocery store, waste bin, market) are all unlikely solutions due to their disconnect from the context of the sentence.
ocean | Knowledge: Expressways are typically found on land and are used to facilitate transportation between different locations on land. The ocean is not a suitable location for an expressway due to the nature of the terrain, which is typically characterized by water rather than a solid surface suitable for building roads. The other options, while not necessarily optimal locations for expressways, do not have any inherent limitations that would make them impossible locations for an expressway.
nightmares | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James experiences negative consequences from reading before bed due to his active imagination. Nightmares are a common side effect of reading scary or suspenseful books before bed. Enlightenment and entertainment are positive outcomes that are not hinted at in the sentence. Cramps and drowsiness are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
edinburgh | Knowledge: Castle Rock is a prominent location in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is home to Edinburgh Castle, which is one of the most iconic attractions in the country. The other options are not relevant to the location or context of the question.
tree tops | Knowledge: Monkeys are known to inhabit forests and jungles, and are known for their ability to climb and swing from tree to tree. This suggests that monkeys are commonly found in the tree tops or canopy of forests, rather than in research laboratories or zoos. While some monkeys may be found in zoological gardens, this option is not as specific as the choice of tree tops.
being able to use | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that some people have a tendency to overshop and purchase products that they would not typically use or need. This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the practicality or usefulness of the products. "Being able to use" fits this description, as it implies that the products are not necessarily functional or necessary for the buyer. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
gain weight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that overeating leads to a particular consequence. The word "obesity" in the choices is a strong indicator that this consequence is related to weight gain. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
blizzard | Knowledge: The sentence mentions heavy rain and cold weather, which are both characteristic of a blizzard. A blizzard is a severe winter storm that includes heavy snowfall and strong winds, so the cold temperature and heavy precipitation described in the sentence fit with this type of storm. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence; a hurricane is a tropical storm with heavy rain and wind, cactus and ocean are not weather events, and drowning is not a type of storm.
foreigner | Knowledge: In most contexts, a person who is not a citizen of a country is considered a foreigner. This term is commonly used in immigration law and policy discussions, and refers to someone who is from another country and is not a legal resident or citizen of the country in question. The other options in the list (countryfolk, immigrant, subject, and alien) do not accurately describe the concept of being a non-citizen.
choice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using addictive drugs is something negative, which implies that it is a choice that should be avoided. The other options do not convey the same negative connotation or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
eat vegetables | Knowledge: The sentence says the vegan was tired of being hungry, which implies that they were not eating enough food to satisfy their hunger. Since the vegan has not yet quit veganism, it is likely that they will choose an option that aligns with their dietary restrictions. Eating vegetables would be a logical choice since they are a staple in a vegan diet and are known to be filling and nutritious. Making bread or eating quickly may not necessarily alleviate hunger, and having food is too general without any mention of what type of food.
water fountain | Knowledge: The sentence describes the faucet spraying liquid high up into the air, which resembles the function of a water fountain. A water fountain is specifically designed to create a visually pleasing spraying effect of water in a decorative manner. The other options do not accurately capture the description of the broken faucet's spraying action.
make mistakes | Knowledge: The word "carelessly" suggests that the actions being taken are not well thought out or considered. Making mistakes is a common result of acting carelessly, as it often involves not paying attention or rushing through tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a likely result of acting carelessly.
cinema | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location in question is a single screen establishment that is not as expensive as other locations. This rules out options like hotels and airports which are typically more expensive. In addition, the mention of an uptick in customers implies that the location is an entertainment venue, which would make options like art shows and airports unlikely. The only remaining option is cinema, which fits the context of the sentence.
fatigue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Justin had to stop dancing because of something physical, specifically fatigue. This means that he likely became tired or exhausted from dancing for a certain amount of time. The other options, such as meeting new people or having fun, do not provide a logical reason for why he had to stop dancing. Additionally, the word "manual" seems out of place and does not fit with the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person did not want to go to a department store to buy the product, which implies that the product is commonly sold in department stores. Disposable razors are commonly found in supermarkets and drugstores as well, making the supermarket option the most likely choice. The other options such as hotel room, garbage, restaurant, and medicine cabinet do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
San Diego | Knowledge: San Diego is located in southern California, which has a large Mexican-American population and a strong influence of Mexican culture. As a result, it is likely that this city would have a high number of Mexican restaurants. The other options do not have any clear connection to Mexican cuisine or culture.
table | Knowledge: Social etiquette generally dictates that it is impolite to put your feet on a table, especially when other people are present. This is likely because it is seen as unsanitary and disrespectful to the object, which is usually a piece of furniture or a surface used for eating or working. The other options do not have the same connotation of being unsanitary or disrespectful.
cupboard | Knowledge: The question is asking where to store a salad bowl when it is not in use. Of the options provided, "cupboard" seems to be the most logical choice as it is commonly used to store dishes and other kitchen utensils. "French restaurant" and "buffet" are places where a salad bowl might be used, but not stored. "Lettuce" is a type of food that might be served in a salad bowl, while "dishwasher" is not a proper storage location for any kitchen utensil.
bland | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Tuna surprise lacks flavor, which means that it is most likely bland. "Sneaky" and "predictable" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Water buffalo" is a type of animal and is not related to the dish. "Known about" is also unrelated and does not provide any information on the taste of the dish.
storage area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cardboard box was used to transport boxes of shoes, which implies that it was likely located in a shoe store or storage area. The fact that Joe found a man sleeping in the box suggests that it was likely in a secluded or hidden location, such as a back alley or storage area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hospital | Knowledge: The sentence states that the lesson took place on a tennis court, but it also mentions "paying patients." This suggests that the lesson was not a recreational one, but rather one that was meant to have therapeutic benefits for people who were being treated at a hospital. The other options (health club, park, country club, Wimbledon) do not fit this context.
bushes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard's movements caused a rustling sound, which is commonly associated with bushes. Bushes have leaves and branches that can rustle and make noise when something moves through them, making them the most likely answer. The other options, such as trees or rocks, do not have the same characteristics that would create a rustling sound.
lay down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people want to rest when they get tired, and the verb "lay down" indicates a comfortable position to rest or nap. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence. "Speak languages" and "talk to each other" both suggest communication, which is not related to napping or resting. "Imagine" suggests mental activity, which is not related to physical rest. "To work" suggests activity, which is opposite to the concept of rest.
newspaper | Knowledge: The keyword here is "articles." Photographers often accompany their pictures with articles, and newspapers are a common platform for this type of collaboration. Newspapers usually have a specific section dedicated to photography, where pictures are shown alongside articles that feature them. The other options, such as trunk, art show, fridge, and books, do not make sense in the context of posting pictures alongside articles.
silence | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the teacher wants complete absence of sound or noise, which is typically referred to as silence. The other options may involve some level of noise or talking, even if it is reduced or controlled. Additionally, the phrase "shut up" is a colloquial and impolite way of telling someone to be quiet, while "being quiet" and "think first" may not necessarily convey the same level of strictness and emphasis on silence as "silence" does.
get food | Knowledge: The question is asking about the necessary action to be able to have lunch. Out of the choices provided, "get food" is the most appropriate answer as it implies the acquisition of food, which is necessary before one can eat. "Eat food" is not a valid answer as the question is not asking about what to do during lunch. "Stop working" is not necessarily a requirement for having lunch, and "spend money" may not be applicable in all situations as one can also bring their own food. "Prepare food" is also a valid answer but it is not as specific as "get food" which implies going out or acquiring food from somewher.
becoming tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had been running for a long time and it had taken a toll on him. The phrase "he knew it was time to stop" implies that he was becoming fatigued and needed to rest. The other options, such as sore feet or leg cramps, might also be a result of running for a long time, but they do not necessarily indicate that it is time to stop. Shortness of breath might suggest a more serious issue, but there is no indication in the sentence that it was the reason for the person to stop running.
home | Knowledge: Tabby cats are domesticated animals and are typically happiest and most comfortable in a familiar, safe environment such as their home. The other options may not provide the same level of comfort or safety for the cat. For example, an alley or street would not be a safe place for a cat, while a cellar may be too dark and isolated for a social animal like the tabby cat. Laps may provide comfort, but a cat still needs their own space to retreat to, which is usually found in their home.
blue ridge mountains | Knowledge: The question suggests that the location being referred to is a mountain, which rules out the options of Louisiana and Oregon as they are states and not specific locations. The option of a pet store is also unlikely as it does not relate to a natural habitat for snakes. The option of a tropical forest is also unlikely as snakes in tropical regions tend to inhabit lower elevations. The only plausible option is the Blue Ridge Mountains, where one may find species such as rattlesnakes and copperheads that are known to inhabit mountainous regions.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a city employee is handling plants, which implies that the plants are likely part of a public green space that the employee has a responsibility to maintain. Parks are known to have plants and vegetation, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Offices and windowsills are unlikely places for city employees to handle plants, and gardens may be privately owned rather than publicly maintained spaces.
forgetting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is experiencing a progressive loss of memory, where he is unable to remember events from his recent past. This loss of memory is referred to as forgetting, as opposed to forgotten, which implies that the memory has already been lost. Rehabilitating and forgetfulness both suggest an attempt to improve or treat John's memory loss, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Last forever is also incorrect because it does not accurately reflect John's current situation.
deck of cards | Knowledge: The mention of "queen" and "win" in the sentence suggests that the person was playing a game involving cards (such as poker, bridge, or hearts) where the queen card is often valuable. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
repair shop | Knowledge: The sentence states that Bill's tire was flat, indicating that his car is in need of repair. The logical next step for Bill would be to take his car to a repair shop to get the tire fixed. The other options, such as Toronto, flammable, car show, and airport do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and would not help Bill with the current problem he is facing.
run | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who is not known for fighting and is filled with fear will have a natural instinct to do something to protect themselves. Running is a common response to fear and is a natural instinct for self-preservation. None of the other options have a clear connection to fear and self-preservation.
feel resentful | Knowledge: Being stood up on a date often involves feeling disappointed and let down, which can lead to feelings of resentment towards the other party. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response that one might have in this situation.
being imprisoned | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a "killing" and the word "immediately" suggests that there will be swift consequences for the action. "Going to jail" and "being imprisoned" are both consequences that can happen immediately after committing a serious crime like killing someone. "Going to the store" and "feeling of guilt" don't make sense in this context, and "no longer live" suggests a permanent consequence rather than an immediate one.
fish market | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the crab was being transported for the purpose of being sold and consumed at a food market. The options "Gulf of Mexico" and "North Sea" are bodies of water and do not provide any indication of a destination for a food shipment. "Picnic basket" and "grocery store" may be places where food is consumed or sold, but they do not specifically indicate that the crab is being transported there.
wreak | Knowledge: The word "intoxicated" suggests that the person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, impairing their ability to make rational decisions. The word "havoc" suggests that their actions may have caused chaos or damage. The most appropriate choice would be "wreak," as it means to cause widespread damage or destruction. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
learning | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was not skilled at communicating with others and that he sought help from a mentor. The most reasonable inference is that he put effort into learning how to better communicate with others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. While exchanging ideas could potentially help with communication, the focus of the sentence seems to be on Billy's personal effort to improve. The options puzzle, confusion, and response do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
increased heart rate | Knowledge: Jumping rope is a form of exercise that requires physical exertion. Physical activity causes the heart to beat faster to pump oxygen to the muscles, which results in an increased heart rate. Sweating is also a common reaction to physical activity, but it is not necessarily uncomfortable. Having fun and smiling are subjective experiences that may or may not occur during jumping rope. Anger is not a consequence typically associated with jumping rope.
experience pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person derives enjoyment from expensive things. This is a common reason why people may choose to spend more money on certain items. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why someone would choose to spend more money on something.
walk away | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the visit with someone has come to an end, and the natural course of action would be to leave the location where the visit took place. "Walk away" is the only choice that accurately describes this action. The other options are either inappropriate or do not make sense in the given context.
conquer opponent  | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the greed of leadership of a country is motivated by the wealth of another country. When a country has a large amount of wealth, this can create an incentive for those in power to try to acquire it by any means necessary, including through military conquest. The phrase "conquer opponent" suggests an aggressive and forceful approach to acquiring wealth or resources from another country. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
deep ocean | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shark followed the fish into an area of the water that is deep and dark. The option "deep ocean" is the only choice that describes a location that fits this description. The other options, such as the desert, Sea World, or a maritime museum, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Scotland | Knowledge: The name "Aberdeen" is commonly associated with Scotland, as it is a major city located in the northeast region of the country. None of the other options listed are known for having a city named Aberdeen. Additionally, the word "city" implies a larger urban area, which would rule out options like South Dakota and Maryland.
death | Knowledge: The word "dangerous" in the sentence suggests that there is a significant risk involved in the events. In such situations, there is a real possibility that the competitors could get seriously injured or even die. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is "death." The other options, such as "boredom" or "accomplishment," do not fit with the context of the sentence as they are not consequences of participating in dangerous events.
nightclub | Knowledge: The combination of dancing and a bar is a common feature of nightclubs. Nightclubs are establishments that typically feature loud music, dancing, and alcohol. The other options do not necessarily have dancing or a bar as a central feature.
interested in | Knowledge: The word "examine" suggests that the person is looking closely and studying the item. If they are doing this for a long time, it indicates that they are interested in the product and want to make an informed decision about it. "Angry" does not fit the context, and "know what" and "might want" are not feelings. "Interesting" is a possible option, but "interested in" is a more fitting choice for the context of the sentence.
have fever | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that waking up with sweats is not a normal occurrence when working out, but rather a symptom of something else. One common cause of waking up with sweats is a fever, which is a sign of an underlying illness or infection. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
reflection | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was engaged in some form of introspection or self-reflection, which made her consider her choice of makeup. Reflection often involves deep thought and contemplation about one's self and experiences. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
basket | Knowledge: The question asks for a good name for a small dog, which suggests that the answer should be a name that is appropriate for a small or cute animal. The options "animal shelter", "big house", and "georgia" are not names and do not have any clear connection to small dogs. "Fur" could be a potential name for a small dog, but it is also a physical characteristic of the animal, which may cause confusion. "Basket" is a name that is often used for small and cute animals, such as rabbits or puppies, and therefore would make a good name for a small dog.
nature reserve | Knowledge: Bald eagles are a species of bird that are native to North America and are often found in areas with abundant water sources, such as lakes or rivers. They are also known for building their nests in high trees or cliffs, which can make them vulnerable to human disruption. A nature reserve would provide a protected area where the eagles could live and hunt without disturbance from humans. The other options are unlikely choices for a bald eagle, as they do not provide the necessary habitat or protection for the bird.
excited | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the golfer remained calm on the outside but was feeling a strong emotion internally, implying that he was excited about his victory. The other options involve negative emotions such as wild, frenzied, frantic, and agitated, which are not consistent with the idea of a successful golfer.
jewish neighborhoods | Knowledge: A kosher deli is a delicatessen that follows Jewish dietary laws, which means that it does not serve certain types of meat and dairy products unless they have been prepared in a specific way. Jewish neighborhoods are more likely to have a kosher deli than other places because they have a larger population of Jewish people who adhere to these dietary restrictions. While Jerusalem is a city with a significant Jewish population, the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
costa rica | Knowledge: The sentence mentions two clues - coasts and sloth - which are commonly associated with Costa Rica. Costa Rica is a country that is located in Central America and has both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines. It is also known for its biodiversity, including many species of animals, such as sloths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desktop | Knowledge: The question is asking where it may be difficult to do homework if you have cleaned off dust in a specific location. This suggests that the location in question is nearby or connected to where one would typically do homework. A desktop is a common surface for doing homework, and if it has been cleaned off, it may be difficult to work there until it is set up again. The other options do not have a clear relation to homework or to cleaning off dust.
flower petals | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John loves plants because of how they look, which suggests that he is interested in their visual appeal. Out of the options given, flower petals are the most visually striking part of a plant, with their bright colors and distinctive shapes. Cut off limbs and have roots do not relate to the aesthetic qualities of plants, while bloom and grow in garden are too general and do not specifically refer to any particular part of a plant.
travel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something will be made easier during good weather in the winter. Climbing and riding a bike are physical activities that may not necessarily be affected by the weather, so they are less likely to be the correct answer. "Go somewhere" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer. "Travel" is the most likely answer because winter weather often makes travel difficult, with snow and ice causing delays and cancellations. Good weather would make travel easier by improving visibility and making roads safer to drive on.
windowsill | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the plants are indoors and need sunlight, which suggests that they are in a pot or container. The options "roof," "park," and "surface of earth" are not relevant to the context of indoor plant care. While plants can certainly be placed in the ground outside and still get plenty of sunlight, the sentence specifies that the question is about how to ensure they get sunlight indoors. This leaves "windowsill" as the most logical choice, as placing plants on a windowsill is a common way to ensure they get sufficient sunlight while indoors.
apartment complex | Knowledge: The phrase "run in packs" suggests that the small dog is part of a group. Out of the given options, an apartment complex is more likely to have multiple small dogs living in close proximity to each other. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for multiple dogs to run in a pack.
music store | Knowledge: Music stores are a common place to find books and materials related to music education, including scales, sheet music, and instructional books. The other options, such as the post office, assay office, butcher shop, or doctor's office, do not have any clear connection to music education or providing resources for mastering a music scale.
bad taste | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the phrase being referred to describes people who are not concerned about the quality of their food. The option "cheap" is related, but it does not specifically refer to the quality of the food. The options "convenient", "bad workmanship", and "poor workmanship" are unrelated and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
burn | Knowledge: The question is asking about releasing energy from fat, which implies the process of metabolism. When your body metabolizes fat for energy, it undergoes a process called oxidation, which involves breaking down the fat molecules and releasing energy. The most appropriate term among the choices for this process is "burn," which accurately describes the chemical reaction that takes place. The other options may be related to physical activity or mental processes, but they are not directly related to the biological process of energy release from fat.
road | Knowledge: A car is a vehicle designed to travel on roads, making "road" the most logical choice. While a car may visit an airport or repair shop, these locations are not where a car belongs. A race track or freeway are also possibilities, but not all cars are designed for racing or high-speed travel, so "road" is the most universally applicable choice.
nausea | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting drunk and stumbling may lead to a physical sensation, which is often associated with nausea. Drinking too much alcohol can cause disruption to the stomach and digestive system, leading to feelings of nausea and possibly vomiting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
air | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a contrast between a pile of something in the driveway (presumably snow) and the peaceful appearance of a snowflake. The only option that relates to the appearance of a snowflake is "air," as snowflakes are individual, delicate and graceful in the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer knew that potatoes would not grow in the city, which implies that he must look for a rural or agricultural area where he could find suitable land to plant potatoes. The choice "countryside" is the most logical since it is associated with farming and agriculture, and it is where farmers usually cultivate their crops. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
house | Knowledge: Board games are typically played indoors, and the most common indoor location for playing board games is in someone's home, such as their house or den. The other options, such as shelf or toy store, are not locations where board games are typically played but may be places where they are stored or purchased. The term "shelter" could refer to a variety of locations, but it is not clear from the question whether it is a indoor or outdoor location.
four sides | Knowledge: A square is a geometric shape that has four sides of equal length and four angles of 90 degrees each. Therefore, the correct answer is that a square is constructed of four sides. The other options are not related to the definition of a square and can be eliminated.
repeat | Knowledge: Memorization often involves repetition, as the process of repeating information helps to reinforce it in the mind. Concentration may also be involved, but the act of repetition is more directly related to the question. Storing data may be a necessary step in the process of memorization, but it is not necessarily something that someone actively does during the process. Being awake is a prerequisite for memorization, but it is not a specific action that someone takes in order to memorize something.
shop | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the workplace is informal and that the cashier loves antiques. A shop is more likely to have an informal atmosphere and sell antiques than a fast food restaurant, supermarket, or grocery store. While a bookstore may also have an informal atmosphere, there is no mention in the sentence of the cashier having a love for books or literature.
ocean | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John's vessel went down while he was traveling from Britain to America, indicating he is likely in the ocean. Additionally, the sentence mentions that there is no land in sight, further suggesting that he is in a large body of water such as the ocean. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
nanotechnology | Knowledge: The other options listed are not types of science. "Space lab" and "university" refer to physical locations, while "methodology" and "school" are more general terms that could refer to a variety of fields. "Nanotechnology," on the other hand, is a specific field of science that deals with materials and devices of a very small scale, typically at the nanometer level. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
box | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair dryer was still in its original packaging, which would most likely be a box. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The bathroom could be a possible location for using a hair dryer, but it does not explain why the hair would have already dried before she took the dryer out. The trash and drug store are not relevant to the sentence at all, and the beauty salon is not a likely location for someone using a brand new hair dryer at home.
carpet | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the presence of mold covering a padding that was not visible until it was pulled up. The only option that could potentially have a padding that could hide mold and be pulled up is the carpet. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
chair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah sat down to read her newspaper, which is a common activity that people do while sitting in a chair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - a rug is not typically associated with sitting to read, nor is a front door or jail, and while a porch may be a place to sit, the sentence does not suggest that Sarah is outside.
swallowing | Knowledge: The question is asking about the body part that is doing the work while drinking, so the most logical answer would be the one involved in the act of swallowing. The other options are either related to the container used for drinking (glass) or the action of bringing the drink to one's mouth (mouth). Therefore, swallowing is the correct answer as it involves the physical action of pushing the liquid down the throat.
Ohio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that buckeyes and apples are related in some way, and that they grow well in a particular state. Buckeyes are the state tree of Ohio, so it is likely that the sentence is referring to that state. Additionally, Ohio is known for its apple production, so this makes the most sense as the answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
public building | Knowledge: The context suggests that the ficus is located at an entrance, which typically indicates a public space rather than a private home. The options "arboretum," "wet places," and "great outdoors" do not fit the context of a specific entrance.
own car | Knowledge: The question is asking which moving object will make a person happy to have, and out of the options given, only "own car" fits that description. Catching a cold is a negative experience, experiencing joy is a feeling rather than an object, a submarine is not typically owned or associated with happiness, and believing in God is a personal belief rather than a physical object. Therefore, "own car" is the correct answer.
class | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "raise my hand" suggests that the person is likely in a classroom setting where the norm is to raise your hand to get the teacher's attention or ask a question. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
artist | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a term that describes someone who creates art. The correct answer is "artist" since that is the specific word used to describe someone who makes visual or performing art. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide an accurate or relevant answer.
glee, laughter, being happy, smiling | Knowledge: The question asks about the emotional result of having fun, which is typically associated with positive feelings. Glee, laughter, being happy, and smiling are all common expressions of joy and happiness. Injuries, on the other hand, are not related to the emotional experience of having fun and therefore do not fit the context of the question.
money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when you buy beer, you give the cashier something and they give you back less of it. The only logical option is money since it is the currency used to purchase goods. The other options do not make sense in the context of buying beer at a store.
attic | Knowledge: Mice are known to enter homes through small openings or cracks, and the attic is a common entry point as it often has gaps or openings that lead to the exterior of the house. Garages and cupboards may have entry points, but they are not as common as attics. Kitchens are also not likely to be entry points for mice as they do not usually have direct access to the exterior of the house. Sewers are more likely to be an exit point for mice, rather than an entry point into a house.
board ship | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a sailor must complete preparation work before the ship can leave, implying that the sailor has already arrived at the dock or harbor where the ship is located. Therefore, the first step the sailor must take is to board the ship. The other options do not address the initial step required for the ship to leave, and "coming home" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
canada | Knowledge: The question suggests that the barber shop is located north of the U.S., which eliminates all the other options except for Canada. Canada is the only country located north of the U.S. Among the other options, small town, neighborhood, high street, and motel can be found anywhere in the U.S. but not north of it.
public place | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah drank from a water fountain that is accessible to the general public. Water fountains are commonly found in public places such as parks, schools, and other areas that are accessible to a large number of people. The other options are not necessarily associated with water fountains or public access.
screened porch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus plant is not inside the house but is still protected from bugs, which rules out placing it near windows or in shady places where insects are more likely to be. Clay pots or multiple pots do not necessarily offer bug protection, and the choice of words "protected from bugs" implies a deliberate effort to keep the plant safe from pests, which is often easier to achieve in an enclosed or screened area such as a porch.
make war | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the general did something that he didn't like but felt compelled to do. "Make war" is a common phrase that means to engage in military conflict, which is often a necessary but unpleasant task for a general. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be things that a general would do.
play video games | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child wants to do something fun or enjoyable after school. Playing video games is a common pastime for many children, and is often associated with leisure and entertainment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
NASA | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions a shuttle being inverted onto a launch platform, which is a clear reference to the space program. NASA is the government agency responsible for managing the United States' civilian space program, and would be the most likely entity to be operating a shuttle in this context. The other options, such as a battleship or a trapeze, have no connection to the space program or launching shuttles.
comb | Knowledge: It is a common practice for barbers to use a comb to style and tidy up a customer's hair before they leave the shop. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not typically used right before leaving. Military base and Seville have no clear connection to the context of a barber shop, and small town is too general to be a specific answer.
open field | Knowledge: Gazelles are known for their speed and agility and are typically found in grasslands and open areas where they can easily run and maneuver. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "open field", as it is the only option that is associated with an environment that would be suitable for a gazelle to run in. The other options, such as "uphill", "asia", and "encyclopedia", have no clear connection to the behavior of gazelles. "Steppe" may be a plausible choice, but it is less specific than "open field" and may not necessarily evoke the same mental image of a vast and unobstructed landscape.
suspension bridge | Knowledge: The use of the words "steel cable" suggest that the correct answer involves something that is suspended or hanging, and that can support weight. Only a suspension bridge fits this description, as it is constructed using steel cables and can support the weight of people walking across it. The other options do not involve a steel cable or the ability to support weight in the same way.
achieve | Knowledge: The phrase "performing successfully" implies that the person is achieving their goals and succeeding in their endeavors. Therefore, the answer choice that best fits with this context is "achieve." The other options, such as anxiety, fear, and energetic, do not necessarily correlate with performing successfully. Happiness may be a possible outcome of success, but it is not directly stated in the question.
pressure | Knowledge: The sentence states that John was running late for work, which suggests that he may have felt pressure to arrive on time. Anxiety and stress are also possible emotions in this situation, but boredom and getting there do not fit the context of the sentence.
life | Knowledge: The phrase "crossroads" is often used figuratively to describe a point in someone's life where they have to make an important decision that will significantly affect their future. Therefore, the correct answer is life. The other options are not relevant in the context of the sentence.
Punishment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog is disobedient and that the owner has not given it something that could potentially encourage obedience, like a treat. However, the incorrect choices do not provide any logical reasoning that could be inferred from the sentence. The use of the word "wild" suggests that the dog could have become feral, but the choices of "guard house" and "abandoned" do not align with that idea, whereas "punishment" is a common technique to train a disobedient dog.
discount | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill had to pay taxes on the full price, regardless of any special deal or offer he received. The word "discount" indicates that Bill received a reduced price, but he still had to pay taxes on the original amount. The other options do not provide any clear indication of why Bill had to pay tax on the full price. "Refund" and "less money" both suggest that the price was reduced, but do not indicate why Bill had to pay taxes on the full amount. "Death and" and "free money" are not related to the context of the sentence at all.
legal problems | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting someone else may have negative consequences for the offender, which could include legal problems. Hurting someone else could result in charges of assault or other crimes, leading to legal repercussions. The other options do not reflect this specific consequence and may not be relevant to the context of the sentence.
coffee shop | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the girl went somewhere to drink a cup of coffee, which suggests that the answer is a place where people typically go to purchase coffee. The most likely option is a coffee shop. The other options, such as desk, office, upstairs, and table, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
stadium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was unable to attend an event because the ticket office was sold out and that the event was likely related to football. Since the other options (auditorium, arena, city, and area) don't specifically relate to hosting football-related events, the correct answer is likely stadium, which is a venue commonly used for sports events such as football games.
question | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person gave a thoughtful reply to a question, which is what was overlooked. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ground | Knowledge: When you throw litter away, it typically falls to the ground. This is the most logical answer choice based on common sense and knowledge of how litter behaves. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
loss of innocence | Knowledge: The question asks for a negative consequence of learning about the world, which suggests that there may be negative aspects to gaining knowledge. "Loss of innocence" in this context generally refers to becoming aware of harsh realities or unpleasant truths, which can be a difficult and painful process. The other options may be negative consequences in certain contexts, but they are not necessarily related to learning about the world.
warm place | Knowledge: Wild cats, such as lions, tigers, and leopards, are typically found in warm environments such as savannas, forests, and grasslands. They require warmth to survive and thrive, which is why they are not typically found in colder environments such as mountains or colder regions of the world. The other choices, such as restaurants, beams of sunlight, or floors, do not have any connection to the natural habitat of wild cats.
carpet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something has replaced wood in most people's dwellings. The sentence also implies that this replacement is common and something that people have in their homes. The only option that meets these criteria is "carpet," which is a common flooring material used in many homes as an alternative to wood. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly found in people's homes or do not replace wood in any way.
wave goodbye | Knowledge: Saying farewell to someone is often accompanied by a wave goodbye, which is a common gesture used to signify goodbye or farewell. Rubbing their head, experiencing fear, watching television, and springing into action do not make sense in the context of saying farewell, and are not commonly associated with this situation.
wetness | Knowledge: When taking a bath, your body becomes wet because you are submerging yourself in water. "Cleanness" is a result of a bath, not something that covers you during it. "Exfoliation" refers to the process of removing dead skin cells, which may occur during a bath but isn't something that covers you. "Use water" is not a covering but an action that is taken during a bath. "Rash" is a skin irritation and not something that covers you during a bath.
lose | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the first team had a significant lead over the second team, with over 100 points compared to the second team trailing by more than 50 points. This implies that the second team is likely to lose the game, as they have a lot of ground to make up in order to catch up with the first team. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
space | Knowledge: The question is referring to a place beyond our world, which is commonly associated with outer space. The solar system and galaxy are both within our world, and countries are not typically associated with other worlds. Narnia is a fictional world, so it is not applicable in a literal sense.
get excited | Knowledge: The sentence implies that finding out about going somewhere has a positive connotation, which is often associated with the feeling of excitement. Getting excited is a natural response to the prospect of experiencing something new or potentially enjoyable, which also aligns with the context of the sentence. The other options may not make as much sense or may be too specific to the mode of transportation.
trash | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the old clothes were not useful even as rags, implying that they were in very poor condition and could not be salvaged. Therefore, the most appropriate place for them would be the trash. The other options (loft, attic, trunk) suggest potential storage locations which do not align with the given context. Meanwhile, the fire pit option is an unlikely place for old clothes to belong.
laundromat | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a machine that takes quarters, which is a common feature of laundromats where customers pay to use washers and dryers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - assembly lines typically involve automated machinery, streets are not typically associated with machines that take quarters, the White House is a government building and not a place where laundry is done, and simply "house" is too vague to make a clear connection.
workplace | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam is employed at a union shop, meaning a workplace where employees are represented by a labor union. In such workplaces, joining the union may be a requirement for continued employment, as the union negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the employer on behalf of its members. Sam not wanting to join the union suggests that he may have personal objections to being in a union, but if he wants to continue working at the shop, he has no choice but to join or leave the workplace. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
loss of innocence | Knowledge: The question suggests that learning about the world and its injustices is likely to have a negative impact on a person, which can be further supported by the use of the phrase "loss of innocence." The other answer choices do not fit the context, as anger and pleasure are emotions that are not necessarily tied to learning about injustices, while happiness and enlightenment are more positive outcomes that are generally associated with gaining knowledge.
lot of grief | Knowledge: Divorce is often associated with emotional struggles and grief, especially for the person getting divorced. Studies have shown that divorce can lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety, and often involves a period of adjustment and recovery. The other options are not necessarily negative effects of divorce, and some may even be considered positive, depending on the individual's perspective. For example, "freedom" and "no spouse" may be seen as positive outcomes for someone who feels trapped or unhappy in their marriage. "Happiness" may also be a desired outcome, but it is not necessarily the result of divorce for everyone. "Children suffer" is also a commonly cited negative effect of divorce, but it involves other people and is not specified in the question.
new-york | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to a specific city known for its nightlife and club scene. New York is commonly associated with its vibrant nightlife, and is home to many famous nightclubs, making it the most likely answer. The other options, such as "major city" or "building," are too broad and don't provide enough context to determine a specific answer.
train station | Knowledge: The phrase "use a large vehicle made up of multiple sections that are attached to each other" is commonly associated with trains or railway systems. The options "bus station" and "bus" may be tempting choices, but the key word "sections" suggests that the vehicle being referred to is not a bus, which is usually made up of a single compartment. The other options, "park" and "town," are not relevant to the context of the question.
study together | Knowledge: The question is asking for a way to be social while completing assignments, therefore, studying together would be the most appropriate answer. Arm wrestling is a physical activity and doesn't relate to studying, while studying philosophy and reading books can be done individually, and further education refers to continuing education beyond the current assignment.
manipulate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman used a tactic of surprising the man with a kiss to convince him to continue with the plan, indicating that she was trying to manipulate his actions. The other options do not convey this sense of intentional influence and are therefore incorrect.
sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was so tired that he needed to rest, and he soon fell to something that indicates a state of deep relaxation. The most appropriate option is sleep because it is a natural state of rest that allows the body to recharge and recover. The other options, such as relax or sit down, do not imply a state of deep relaxation that is necessary for the man to recover. The option "his death" is incorrect because it is not a natural consequence of the man being exhausted and needing rest.
had good voice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who sings well possesses a certain trait, and the most likely trait is having a good voice. The other options do not accurately describe a trait that someone who sings well would possess. Annoying people around does not relate to singing well, and enjoy and practice are actions rather than traits. Nice sound is a possibility, but having a good voice is more commonly used to describe someone who sings well.
writer's hand | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about a place where a writing instrument is needed, so options like pocket and purse do not fit the context. Similarly, stationary may refer to a store selling writing supplies, but it does not indicate a specific location where a writing instrument is needed. The correct answer is writer's hand, as this is where a writing instrument is typically held and used for writing. Classroom could also be a possible answer if the context of the question is related to a learning environment where writing often occurs.
acquire and consume food | Knowledge: The word "cafeteria" refers to a space where people go to acquire and consume food. Schools typically have cafeterias where students go during lunch periods to eat. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not related to the purpose of a cafeteria.
respiration | Knowledge: The botanist's observation suggests that he was able to observe the plant's respiratory processes, which are indicative of it being a living organism. Respiration is the process by which living organisms exchange gases with the environment, specifically taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. The other options are not related to the processes of living organisms or plant biology.
raise corn | Knowledge: Illinois and Iowa are two of the top corn-producing states in the United States. Therefore, it is likely that a farmer in either state would be primarily raising or growing corn crops. The other options, such as growing or seeding plants, and growing animals do not have the same association with the agricultural practices of these states as raising corn does.
produce goods | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoyed working in a factory, which implies that they were involved in some form of production. The phrase "for sale" further emphasizes this point, as it implies that the goods produced were intended for commercial purposes. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. "Earn money" is a possible motivation for working in a factory, but it doesn't explain what the person actually did. "Introduction" and "workhour" don't make sense in this context. "Create" is a possibility, but it is less specific than "produce goods."
roof | Knowledge: The sentence talks about a windstorm damaging something that needed to be replaced. The most likely option for something that is damaged by a windstorm and needs to be replaced is a roof. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
dizziness and headaches | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that jumping up and down leads to a specific set of symptoms, specifically dizziness and headaches. While exercise and exhaustion can cause dizziness and tiredness, they are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Cramps are a physical discomfort, but not necessarily associated with jumping up and down. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is dizziness and headaches.
results | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person's hard work in taking care of proposals has led to some form of positive outcome. The word "good" suggests that the outcome was desirable, and the context of the sentence implies that this outcome was a result of the person's diligence. The other options are not directly tied to the context of the sentence and do not make as much sense based on the information given.
desktop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the picture in question is one that you want to see frequently, which implies that it is important to you and you want to easily access it. The desktop of a computer is a common place to put frequently accessed files, icons or shortcuts. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to storing digital images or accessing them easily.
downtown | Knowledge: Downtown areas of cities are often cultural hubs that attract various forms of entertainment, including music performances. Concert halls are common in downtown areas, as they offer a central location for audiences to gather and enjoy live music. While commercial buildings, university buildings, and theaters may also have performance spaces, there is no specific indication that they are more likely to have a concert hall than any other type of building. Musicians, while associated with music, are not relevant to the question of where a concert hall is likely to be located.
being appreciated | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the expert is performing on stage and is hoping for something positive to happen. The options "explode," "stage fright," and "injury" all suggest negative outcomes, which are unlikely to be the expert's goal. "Getting attention" could be a goal, but it is not a clear indication of success since the attention could be positive or negative. "Being appreciated" is a more positive and specific goal, which would imply that the audience is enjoying and valuing the performance.
pink or red | Knowledge: Roses are commonly known for their pink or red flowers, although they can also come in other colors such as white or yellow. The sentence does not provide any context to suggest that the answer would be "vase," "blue," or "fragrant," which are not characteristics of the flowers themselves.
prepare dinner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher was hungry after a long day of teaching and grading homework, indicating that she would likely want to eat something. The option "prepare dinner" is the most logical and expected response in this context. The other options do not make sense or are inappropriate, such as "eat children."
angry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is likely to feel a negative emotion in response to someone hurting someone else. Out of the choices, only "angry" fully captures that negative emotion. "Feel remorse" implies a feeling of guilt or regret, which would be inappropriate for the wronged party. "Will resent" suggests a long-term grudge against the perpetrator, which isn't necessarily implied by the sentence. "Feel sad" doesn't capture the sense of moral outrage that the word "hurt" implies. "Bad karma" is not a valid emotional response, but rather a spiritual or philosophical concept.
explain meaning of words | Knowledge: The sentence states that a dictionary was important for teachers and students, which suggests that the purpose of the dictionary was to aid in learning and understanding the meanings of words. The other options (manual, shelf, table, classroom) do not relate to the function or purpose of a dictionary.
park | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John threw trash onto a field, which suggests that he is in an outdoor space. Of the choices provided, park is the most likely option as it is a common outdoor space where people might gather and a field is often found in a park. The other options, such as wastepaper basket and wastebasket, are containers for trash and not relevant to the context of the sentence. The garbage dump is a location for dumping large amounts of trash and is unlikely to be where John threw his trash. While John could be at a soccer game, the sentence doesn't provide any direct indication that he is there specifically.
irritation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe dislikes interruptions during his lunch, specifically phone calls. The word "irritation" implies a feeling of annoyance or frustration, which would likely be the emotional response to an interruption during a meal. The other options are not as relevant to the context of the sentence.
frustration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being interrupted while creating art can have a negative impact on the artist, as the word "likely" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between interruptions and an emotional response. The option "relax" is unlikely to be correct because interruptions are inherently disruptive and stressful. "Pleasure" and "controversy" also do not make sense in this context. "Park" is unrelated to the sentence and can be eliminated as an option.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple was having sex frequently in an attempt to conceive a child, which can be physically exhausting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
share ideas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are discussing a problem, which indicates a need for problem solving or brainstorming solutions. Shared ideas could lead to better solutions or a more collaborative approach to solving the problem. The other options do not specifically relate to discussing a problem or finding solutions.
downtown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James had difficulty finding a place to park, which is often a problem in urban areas with busy downtown districts. Taking a bus is a common alternative to driving in such areas. None of the other options in the choices have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ground | Knowledge: Since James is raking leaves, it is logical to assume that he will leave the pile on the ground, which is where the leaves were before he gathered them. Leaves are usually left on the ground to decompose and provide nutrients for the soil, or they may be collected into compost bins. The other options do not make sense in this context; leaving the pile on a roof or in a tree, for example, would be impractical and unlikely.
relaxed position | Knowledge: Cats are known for their ability to sleep for long periods of time throughout the day and night. They typically sleep in a relaxed position, curled up with their legs tucked under their body or stretched out flat. The other options do not describe a typical sleeping position for a cat.
competition | Knowledge: The sentence implies that some people play poker in tournaments for the prizes and challenge, indicating a competitive aspect to the game. While playing poker can be casual and for fun, the reference to tournaments and prizes highlights the importance of competition. The other options do not necessarily align with the context of the sentence, as casinos, losing money, and social events are not necessarily the main reason people participate in poker tournaments.
reproduce | Knowledge: Viruses need to infect a host cell in order to reproduce because they lack the necessary machinery and resources to do so on their own. The other options do not relate to the reproductive process of viruses and therefore can be eliminated as incorrect answers.
concert | Knowledge: The word "rows and rows" suggests a large number of speakers, which is typically associated with concerts or other large events where sound needs to fill a large space. The other options, such as desktop or headphones, would typically only have a small number of speakers or drivers. Town halls and conferences may have more speakers than a desktop or headphone, but still not to the extent of a concert setup.
honest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the politician's actions are motivated by a desire to serve his constituents well, rather than personal gain. This aligns with the characteristic of honesty, which involves being truthful and having strong moral principles. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desert | Knowledge: The sentence references the Mongallan gazelle, which is a type of gazelle that is native to the desert regions of Mongolia. Therefore, it is likely that the sentence is asking about the southern region of a desert, rather than a game preserve, wildlife refuge, or country on the other side of the African continent such as the Ivory Coast or Sudan.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the two best friends had a slumber party, which is typically a sleepover where people stay at someone's house. The other options, such as a movie theatre or internet cafe, do not make sense in the context of a slumber party. Additionally, a fraternity house or school may not be suitable places for two best friends to have a slumber party.
curved | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally did not like the straight blade of the sword she saw. This implies that she is looking for a sword with a different shape. The word "curved" is the best choice because it is the opposite of "straight" and suggests a different shape for the blade. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
stress | Knowledge: The phrase "a lot on his plate" suggests that the individual had a lot of tasks and responsibilities to handle, which can be overwhelming and cause stress. Additionally, starting a business is a significant undertaking that can be stressful, as there are many uncertainties and potential challenges. The other options, such as making money or success, are not necessarily negative outcomes and do not directly relate to the context of the sentence. Failure could also be a possible outcome, but it is not specified in the sentence.
cause death | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that some people enjoy living life quickly, which suggests that they may participate in dangerous or risky activities that can lead to accidents and even death. The other options do not make sense in the context of living life fast.
laziness | Knowledge: The question is asking about the potential negative consequence of relaxing too much, so options like satisfaction and feeling better are unlikely to be correct. Invigorating also does not make sense as it describes a positive outcome. Sleeping could be a potential consequence of too much relaxing, but laziness is a more accurate and common result. Laziness refers to a lack of motivation or activity, which can occur if one spends too much time being leisurely and not engaging in productive or stimulating activities.
floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John may have considered sitting on the floor as an alternative to the hard plastic chair he was sitting in at the airport. This is because sitting on the floor can often be uncomfortable for long periods of time, especially in a public place like an airport where there may be limited seating options. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
receive gifts | Knowledge: Birthdays and Christmas are traditionally occasions where people give and receive gifts. The other options are less commonly associated with these specific occasions. While someone might understand themselves better on their birthday or have a moment of self-reflection, it is not necessarily a common or expected activity. Compliments and acknowledgment might be exchanged, but they are not a central aspect of the celebration. Drinking might occur as part of a festive atmosphere, but it is not a defining characteristic of birthdays or Christmas.
touristic area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location where they returned to their hotel has many sights to offer after a magic show. A touristic area is a place that is specifically designed to attract visitors and typically contains various attractions and activities for tourists. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
minnesota | Knowledge: St. Paul is the capital city of Minnesota, so the correct answer would be Minnesota. The fact that a bald eagle is flying over St. Paul is simply additional information and not relevant to the answer. The other choices, such as Texas, Thermal, Canada, and Photograph, are not related to the context of the question.
strength | Knowledge: A stroke can cause paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, which is often the left side if the stroke occurred in the right hemisphere of the brain. This can result in the loss of strength on the left side of the body, which can affect the person's ability to perform daily tasks and activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
chair | Knowledge: The question suggests that clothes are covering a surface, which is most likely a piece of furniture. Out of the given choices, a chair is the most logical option as it is a common place to temporarily store clothes. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not typically associated with clothing storage.
communication | Knowledge: Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures, and anthropologists often investigate the origins of human behavior and cultural practices. James, as an anthropologist, likely has knowledge about the early development of human communication and expression. The sentence suggests that James believes that creating art was one of the earliest forms of communication, which is a widely accepted theory in anthropology. The other options, such as "penguins" and "relax," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
indigestion or sleepiness (both are acceptable answers) | Knowledge: Turkey is commonly associated with causing both indigestion and sleepiness in individuals who consume it. Indigestion may occur due to the high fat content in turkey, which can be difficult to digest. Sleepiness may be caused by the presence of tryptophan, an amino acid found in turkey that can promote the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which can make you feel drowsy. Thanksgiving is a holiday that often involves eating turkey, but it is not a direct effect of consuming turkey. Throwing up and heartburn are less common side effects of eating turkey.
faces | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the security detail was scanning something that could help them keep an eye on the entire crowd. The option "potato" is unrelated and does not make sense in context. "Body" and "person's head" are too specific and would not allow the security detail to keep track of everyone in the crowd. "Focus" is too vague and doesn't fit the context. Therefore, the most logical answer is "faces" because it is common for security personnel to continually scan the faces of people in a crowd to identify potential threats or individuals of interest.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam enjoyed buying Christmas presents because it made him feel a certain way. The word "pleasure" is the most appropriate choice because it implies a sense of enjoyment or satisfaction. The other options do not fit as well because they either do not relate to Sam's feelings or have a negative connotation (lack of money, relief).
plug in | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is some device or equipment involved in using television, and that it needs to be connected in some way for others to be able to use it. The phrase 'plug in' suggests that it is referring to connecting the television to a power source, which is necessary for it to work. The other options (turn on electricity, open eyes, kill, watch television) do not make sense in this context.
sleepwalking | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John was asleep on his couch and had a dream, but then woke up outside in the rain wrestling an inflatable chair. This suggests that he was sleepwalking, or moving around while still asleep. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
palace | Knowledge: Historically, rulers and monarchs held court in their palaces, which were their main residences and bases of power. A public building, such as a government building or courthouse, may also be a location for holding court, but it is less likely for a ruler to hold court in a public setting. A city or gymnasium are not appropriate locations for holding court, while a conference room may be used for important meetings or negotiations, but it is not a traditional location for holding court.
belligerent | Knowledge: The sentence states that the peaceful nation is scared of their neighbor amassing troops at the border, which implies that the neighbor is showing hostile and aggressive behavior. Belligerent means hostile and aggressive, making it the most suitable answer. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence as the fear is not about warring or violence in general, nor is it about a constitutional referendum.
homeschool | Knowledge: The term "homeschool" refers to a type of education where a student is taught by their parents or guardians at home, rather than attending a traditional school. The other options - classroom, university, parents school, and ask questions - do not accurately describe this type of education. It's important to note that homeschooling can be done in different ways, such as through online programs or with the help of teachers/tutors, but the key characteristic is that it is primarily taught at home.
law firm | Knowledge: The sentence describes Joe as someone who uses complex words with multiple meanings, which suggests he is likely educated and knowledgeable in a particular field. A law firm is a professional setting where such skills would be valuable, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to Joe's skills or personality.
west virginia | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the cave is near the capital of Charleston, which is located in West Virginia. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
recycling center | Knowledge: Empty food cans are typically made of aluminum or steel, both of which are recyclable materials. Recycling centers are specialized facilities that collect and process these materials for reuse. The other options (store, backpack, house, supermarket) do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Denny was searching for his hairbrush in his living space, which eliminates the options of car and drugstore. The fact that he closed the door behind him hints that he was searching in a room, which could be his bedroom or any other room in the house. However, since the sentence doesn't provide any cues about his morning routine or where he usually keeps his hairbrush, bedroom seems like the most logical option.
recur | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that stopping medication may lead to the return of symptoms, which is commonly referred to as a recurrence. This is a known risk for individuals with mental illnesses who stop taking their medication, as medication is often used to manage and ameliorate symptoms. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they suggest different outcomes from stopping medication.
lumberyard | Knowledge: The question is asking where one might find items made from wood, suggesting that the answer is a place that sells or supplies wood products. The most likely option is a lumberyard, which typically stocks a wide variety of wood products for use in construction, furniture, and other applications. The other options (own home, electric store, carpet, boat) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the availability or use of wood products.
none of the above | Knowledge: The question suggests that the cloud is not visible due to darkness. None of the choices provided relate to visibility in the absence of light, so none of them are correct.
diminish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's expectations for his savings in terms of growth were not met, indicating that his savings did not increase in value over time. The word "diminish" means to decrease in size or value, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect what happens to savings when they do not grow, with "explode" being particularly unrealistic.
increase in size | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the growth of one plant is dependent on the growth of another. When a plant increases in size, it is able to provide more nutrients and resources to other plants that are growing in its vicinity, which allows them to grow as well. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence - plants cannot give up or die in order to make another grow, and saying that a plant "gets bigger" is less specific than saying it "increases in size."
sporting goods store | Knowledge: A sporting goods store is a specific type of store that specializes in selling sports equipment, so it is the most likely choice for where one can find sports equipment. The other options do not make sense in this context: a mall is a shopping center that may or may not have a sporting goods store, a bathroom is unlikely to have sports equipment for sale, a school typically does not sell sports equipment, and a sporting event is a place to watch sports, not to buy sports equipment.
brother's house | Knowledge: The term "niece" indicates that the child is the daughter of the person's sibling, which is most likely a brother. Therefore, the correct answer would be "brother's house," as this implies that the niece would live with her uncle or aunt (the person answering the question) at the brother's house. The other options do not provide a clear answer to the question, as they are not related to the context of the sentence.
atlantic | Knowledge: The question is asking for the ocean that comes after the Antarctic Ocean in alphabetical order. The options are listed in random order and the correct choice can be determined by listing them alphabetically. Antarctic and Atlantic are both A's at the beginning, but Atlantic comes after Antarctic because the C in Atlantic comes after the T in Antarctic. The other options are not in close proximity to Atlantic alphabetically.
distress | Knowledge: While learning can be a positive experience that leads to gaining knowledge and increased effectiveness, it can also lead to negative emotions such as distress. This may occur when the learning material is particularly challenging or when the learner feels overwhelmed by the amount of information presented. Dysfunction is also a possibility, but it is not as closely associated with the process of learning as distress is. Happiness is not typically considered a negative emotion or feeling associated with learning.
yard | Knowledge: In a typical town setting, houses are often surrounded by yards or gardens where trees can be planted. An orchard usually is a designated area specifically for growing fruit trees and is not commonly found in residential areas. Conservation land and countryside may have trees, but they are not specifically near houses. Surface of earth is a broad and vague option that does not provide any specific context related to the question.
good heart | Knowledge: Forgiveness is typically associated with having a kind and compassionate nature, indicating that the person has a good heart. The other options do not fit with the concept of forgiveness - "make up" and "new freedom" are not characteristics that someone can have, "good karma" is associated with positive actions and consequences rather than personality traits, and "bad man" is the opposite of forgiving.
play ball | Knowledge: The question is asking for a game to play with children using a round toy. "Play ball" is a common game played with children using a round ball as the toy. The other options do not fit the criteria of using a round toy. "Play with toys" is too vague and could refer to any type of toy, while "play sports" and "throw things" do not specifically mention using a round toy. "Frisbee" is a specific toy, but it is not always in the shape of a round disc and may not be suitable for younger children.
circus | Knowledge: The use of the word "big" suggests that the balloon is larger than normal, which is a common feature of balloons used in circuses. Furthermore, the phrase "floating at the top of a dome" implies that the balloon is suspended in mid-air, which is a common spectacle in circus performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
diaper bag | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a baby bottle that they packed, which indicates that they are likely traveling with a baby. The options "medicine cabinet," "grocery store," "dishwasher," and "liquor store" do not make sense in this context. "Diaper bag" is the most logical choice because it is a place where one would typically pack items for a baby when traveling with them.
set down | Knowledge: The sentence describes the action of lifting a cup to take a drink and then returning the hand back to the table. The most appropriate verb to describe this action would be "set down," which means to place something gently and carefully on a surface. None of the other options fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe the action of returning the cup to the table after taking a drink.
backyard | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place to cook BBQ, which generally refers to a method of outdoor cooking. The option "restaurant" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it suggests that someone would go to a commercial establishment to cook their own food. "Work" and "summer" are not locations and therefore do not fit the context of the question. "Louisiana" may be known for its BBQ but it does not provide a specific location. "Backyard" is the most logical answer as it is a common location for home BBQs.
immune system | Knowledge: The question is asking about something that can fight off disease, which is most commonly associated with the body's immune system. The immune system is responsible for identifying and destroying harmful pathogens that can cause illness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
turn lock | Knowledge: The sentence describes a person who is preparing to bike home, and then takes out a key, which suggests that they are likely at a location where they had to lock up their bike. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn lock." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
design software | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was motivated by curiosity to pursue a certain career. The option "design software" seems the most relevant as it requires curiosity and creativity to create new software designs. The other options such as "use television" and "see exhibits" do not seem to require a significant level of curiosity to pursue as a full-time career. "Read book" and "taking a walk" are not typically considered careers.
illinois | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the man picked the apple from a tree outside of Chicago, so it is likely that the apple came from a nearby location. The only answer choice that is in close proximity to Chicago is Illinois, so this is the most likely correct answer. The other options, such as Washington state, a swamp or woods, are not geographically related to the sentence and do not provide any relevant information.
None of the above | Knowledge: Lemurs are not typically associated with any religious context. Therefore, none of the options provided is a correct answer. It is important to pay attention to the context of the question and eliminate options that do not logically fit with the question's premise.
paper bag | Knowledge: Cats are known for their love of small, enclosed spaces, such as boxes or bags. It is common knowledge that cats often try to fit into small spaces, even if they are too small for them. The options "american home," "barn," "bed," and "own home" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, making "paper bag" the most likely answer.
blossom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah enjoyed the scent of the roses, which is typically associated with the blossoming stage of the flower rather than when it is a closed bud (i.e., not yet open). The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as a vase or a park do not give context to the act of smelling, nor does "cast shadow" or "open" have relevance to the sentence.
unique personality | Knowledge: The statement suggests that every individual possesses something that sets them apart from others, something that defines their individuality. Personality is often a term used to describe a person's distinctive character, behavior, and attitude traits that distinguish them from others. The other choices, such as values or experiences, may be important aspects of an individual's life but do not capture the essence of what makes everyone unique.
terrible | Knowledge: The sentence describes a series of disasters, indicating that something has gone wrong in multiple ways. The word "perfect" suggests that these disasters have occurred in a particularly complete or thorough way, further emphasizing the severity of the situation. "Terrible" best captures the negative tone and sense of calamity conveyed by the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity or comprehensiveness of the described disasters.
volunteer | Knowledge: The question is asking for the "best thing" that teens can do after school, which suggests a positive and productive activity. Smoking and hanging out are not productive and may even be harmful. Homework is important, but the question is asking for something outside of academic work. Going to a movie could be enjoyable, but it may not necessarily be the "best" thing to do. Volunteering, on the other hand, is a productive and fulfilling activity that can benefit both the individual and their community.
cage | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a marmot would be restricted from walking to another continent, which suggests that it is currently in captivity. The option "cage" directly refers to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not provide any context for the marmot's situation or location.
sea water | Knowledge: Anemones are marine animals that typically live in saltwater environments. The options "tide pool" and "sea water" are both related to marine environments, but tide pools are small bodies of water that form along rocky coastlines during low tide, and may not necessarily contain anemones. "South Pacific" is a region, and "movie scene" and "dictionary" are not related to the context of the question. Therefore, "sea water" is the most likely correct answer.
being full | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is no longer hungry and chooses to save the remaining hamburger for later consumption. This suggests that the person has eaten a sufficient amount of food and is now "full." The other options do not provide a relevant reason for stopping to eat the hamburger. Sadness and death are unlikely to be related to food consumption, while heartburn and food poisoning may cause a person to stop eating but are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Mexico | Knowledge: The question is asking about a country in North America that can grow beans for coffee, implying that the country has a suitable climate and terrain for coffee production. Mexico is well-known for its coffee farming and is one of the top producers of coffee in the world. The other options are unrelated and do not provide any information that could lead to the correct answer.
noise | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Joe was trying to be gentle when setting the cup on the table, which suggests that he was trying to avoid making any loud or disruptive sounds that could be considered a distraction. The other options are not applicable to the context of the sentence.
It depends on the specific changes made, so there is no one correct answer.
interesting experiences | Knowledge: The sentence implies that traveling to many different places will result in a variety of experiences, not all of which may be enjoyable. Therefore, it is likely that the person will have interesting experiences, which is a broad term that can encompass a range of activities, sights, and interactions with people from different cultures. The other options do not logically follow from the context of the sentence - having lots of tickets or receiving compliments are not necessarily indicative of travel experiences, feeling pleasure is too general of a term, and looking attractive is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
important | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Superman has a principle that he refuses to kill, and the reason for this principle is that he holds a particular view about the value of life. The word "every" implies that Superman believes that all life is valuable, and "important" is a word commonly associated with the idea of something having great worth or significance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
categorized | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person believes that all information should be difficult to understand or only meant for a select few (esoteric in nature). However, the second part of the sentence suggests that this person does not like the idea of categorizing information, which would make it easier to understand and accessible to more people. The other options are all synonyms for esoteric and do not fit the meaning of the sentence.
grandma's house | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the small dog is owned by the grandmother of the speaker's father. It is common for small dogs to live indoors as pets, and the most likely place for a small dog to live in this context would be at the grandmother's home. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
urban area | Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the previous location, a rural area, with the current location, which is now nonstop crowded. This suggests that the new location is in a more populous and urban setting. The options "medical building" and "strip mall" could potentially be in an urban or rural area, but do not provide enough information to determine the correct answer. "City" and "metro area" also fit the context of an urban setting, but are more general terms that do not specifically refer to a specific type of location.
windowsill | Knowledge: Plants are commonly kept on windowsills inside a house, as they require sunlight to grow and windows provide access to natural light. Plants are not typically found on the surface of the earth or on roof tiles. While a park may have plants, it is not a location within someone's house. A greenhouse is a location where plants can be grown, but it is not necessarily a feature in someone's house.
front door | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Jill read the newspaper at her own residence or perhaps outside of her residence if the newspaper was delivered to her front door. The other options (subway, street, floor, and trash) do not make contextual sense because they are not typical places for reading a newspaper.
sleep disorders | Knowledge: The question implies that someone is snoring, which can be a symptom of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or chronic snoring. Therefore, the correct answer is sleep disorders. The other options do not have a clear relationship to snoring. Loud noise could potentially cause someone to snore or wake them up from snoring, but it is not a likely scenario in the context of the question. Leaving the room or complaining may be a reaction to snoring, but they are not necessarily what other people could be doing. Death is an extreme and unrelated option.
will drown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the absence of an adult during a baby's bath could lead to a dangerous situation. Infants are not able to take care of themselves and can easily drown in just a few inches of water. Therefore, it is important to never leave a baby alone during bath time. The other options do not align with the potential danger of leaving a baby unattended during a bath.
university | Knowledge: Graduating high school typically marks the beginning of higher education for many Americans. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is "university." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
England | Knowledge: The phrase "derby souvenirs" suggests a connection to the annual horse race known as the Derby, which is held in England. Additionally, the term "corner shop" is a term commonly used in England to refer to a small, independently run store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
like | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker was watching a film with explicit content, specifically eroticism. The word "like" in this context implies that the speaker enjoyed watching the film or found it appealing, which is a common reaction to erotic material. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - fear, enlighten, and erection may be relevant to a discussion of erotic content but are not a likely response to watching such material. Masturbation could be a possible response, but it is not the best answer given the wording of the question.
auditorium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is in a place where a speaker is addressing an audience, which is a characteristic commonly associated with an auditorium. Synagogues, groceries stores, and offices are unlikely to have a speaker addressing an audience, and confession is a religious practice that typically takes place in a private setting rather than in a public space with a speaker.
night | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animals in the woods became more active as evening began to fall, indicating that they are likely nocturnal animals that prefer to be active at night. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they either refer to times of day when animals are typically less active or not active at all.
weight gain | Knowledge: The sentence implies that having access to food all the time can have negative consequences, which likely include gaining weight. Eating more calories than one burns can lead to weight gain over time. The other options are less likely to be connected to the context of the sentence: "digesting" is not a negative consequence, "not hungry" suggests a lack of consequences rather than a negative one, "swelling" may happen occasionally but is not generally a consequence of having food available all the time, and "gas" is also an unlikely consequence.
music room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is storing musical instruments. A violin is a traditional orchestral instrument and would likely be stored in a music room, where other instruments are typically kept. The other options (string quartet, orchestra, band room, attic) all describe places where music is played or performed, rather than stored.
all of the above | Knowledge: A projectile is any object that is thrown, shot or projected forward, which means it can come from a variety of sources including a canon, nerf gun, tornado, baseball or any type of weapon. The key to answering this question correctly is understanding the definition of a projectile and recognizing that it can come from multiple sources.
band | Knowledge: Playing an upright piano is typically associated with playing music in a group setting, such as a band, rather than an individual setting like a living room or house. It is also not typically associated with the college or military contexts.
presentation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the audience was learning from what they were watching, which is a common characteristic of presentations. Presentations are often educational or informative, and the audience is there to listen and learn. The other options, such as shows and concerts, may not necessarily have an educational component and the audience may be there purely for entertainment purposes.
vehicles | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people wanted to travel quickly, indicating a need for a mode of transportation. This makes the option "vehicles" the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence, as confessions and toilets are not related to transportation and national parks and supermarkets do not address the need for speed.
learn to speak | Knowledge: Mimicry is the ability to imitate sounds or voices, which is something parrots are well known for. In this context, the sentence suggests that parrots use mimicry to learn how to speak human words or phrases. The other options do not relate to the concept of mimicry or parrots' abilities.
get angry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that reading about terrible injustices can elicit an emotional response. Getting angry is a common reaction to feeling outraged or indignant about something that is unjust. The other options, such as learning about the world or gaining insight, do not necessarily relate to an emotional response. Grief may be a possible reaction, but it is not as strongly suggested by the sentence as getting angry.
cabinet | Knowledge: Liquor is commonly stored in a cabinet, also known as a liquor cabinet or a bar cabinet. This is because liquor needs to be stored in a cool, dark place and a cabinet allows for easy access and organization of the bottles. Fraternity houses may have liquor stored in various places, but it is not a common storage option in a typical home. Soft drinks and night stands are also not common places for liquor storage.
fast food restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lack of a dish at an eatery is unusual, and suggests that the setting is likely to be a fast food restaurant where meals are typically served in disposable packaging or on trays rather than on traditional dinnerware like plates. The other choices don't provide any relevant information to help identify the location based on the given context.
backpack | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy purchased something that can be easily carried around, as he "put them in his" backpack. Out of the given options, only a backpack is a portable item that can be used to carry things around. The other options such as classroom, kitchen sink, cabinet, and store are not suitable for carrying items like pencils around.
arrest | Knowledge: The term "arrest" refers to the act of taking someone into police custody, usually because the person is suspected of committing a crime. The other choices do not have any connection to the context of the question, and are not related to the concept of police custody or law enforcement.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the comforter was used constantly and treaded upon by everyone, indicating that it is a frequently used item for sleeping. Therefore, it should be placed in the bedroom. The linen closet may be a possible option for storage, but it is not the ideal place for a frequently used item. The garbage and living room options are obviously not appropriate. The washing machine may be a good location for cleaning, but not for storing the comforter.
loyal friends  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while family is always the best for devotion, having something else in addition is also nice. The phrase "loyal friends" is commonly associated with companionship, support, and loyalty, which would complement the support provided by family. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sneezing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dusty corner caused a physical reaction in the person doing housework. Sneezing is a common response to inhaling dust and other irritants, so it is the most likely choice. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a common reaction to inhaling dust.
fatigue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and couldn't do much else. This implies that she was likely feeling tired or fatigued, and therefore chose a low-energy activity such as watching TV. The other options are less likely, as joy would imply that she had a good day and was enjoying herself, addiction would imply a compulsive behavior that overrides feelings of fatigue, relaxation would imply a deliberate choice to unwind, and headaches would imply a physical discomfort that would likely prevent her from watching TV.
much | Knowledge: The phrase "over the top" is often used to describe behavior that is excessive or exaggerated. The word "much" is commonly used to convey a sense of excess or abundance, which is why it is the most appropriate option in this context. The other options do not convey the same sense of excessiveness as "much."
home or office | Knowledge: The statement suggests that the carpeting needs to withstand shoes and heavy foot traffic, which is typically a concern in areas of high use. While a gym or church may also have high foot traffic, the reference to the installation taking place in "someone's" space indicates a personal or professional location. "Home or office" is the best fit because it covers both personal and professional spaces that would require durable carpeting. "Bedroom" and "houses" do not provide enough context to make an informed choice.
ground | Knowledge: Well water typically refers to water that is obtained from underground aquifers or wells that tap into them, making "ground" the most likely correct answer. While it is possible that someone could obtain water from a field or the countryside, it would likely require additional equipment or treatment to make it safe for drinking. An oil field, on the other hand, is not a likely source of well water as it typically involves the extraction of oil and gas, not water. Finally, Kansas is a specific location and does not necessarily have any relevance to the answer.
helpful | Knowledge: The question is asking for a characteristic of someone who wants to give assistance, which implies a desire to be useful or supportive of others. The word "helpful" directly relates to this concept and is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Listen" and "prepared" are good qualities for assisting others but do not specifically indicate a desire to provide help. "Humanity" is a vague characteristic that may or may not relate to assistance, depending on the context.
cathedral | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are multiple sights to see, but most people prefer the stained glass at a specific location. The options "doorway", "ancient Rome", "building", and "chapel" do not accurately describe a specific location that would feature stained glass. However, "cathedral" is a common type of religious building that often contains intricate stained glass windows, making it a likely answer.
music store | Knowledge: Drums are a musical instrument that can be found in a variety of contexts, but the most likely place to find one to look at would be a music store. A symphony orchestra may have drums, but they would be part of a larger ensemble and likely not on display for viewing. A child's room may have a toy drum, but it is unlikely that this is what the question is referring to. A rock band may also have drums, but again, they would not be on display for viewing. A parade may feature drummers, but this is not a place where one could easily go to see a drum up close.
sequence of words | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the text had no coherent meaning, indicating that it was just a sequence of words without any logical structure. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not convey the same lack of meaning or coherence. A book, for example, might be difficult to understand but would still have some structure or purpose, while hatred and fade do not relate to language or writing in the same way that analyzing or a sequence of words might.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was up late and using the television as a tool to help him accomplish something. The options "eye strain," "laziness," and "get smarter" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Boredom" is a possibility, but the context suggests that the man had a specific goal in mind. "Falling asleep," on the other hand, is a common reason for people to use the television late at night, as it can help to create a relaxed and drowsy environment.
important | Knowledge: The question is asking for a general description of water to someone, which suggests that the answer should be a broad and fundamental attribute of water. "Important" is the most suitable option because water is essential for all living organisms to survive and is critical for many human activities such as agriculture, industry, and transportation. The other options are either too specific or negative in their association with water.
slaughterhouse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the heifer was no longer useful to the farm, which may mean that it was either too old or unable to produce milk. In such cases, farmers usually sell the animal to make some money. Since "sanctuary farm" and "cow pasture" are not places that buy animals, they can be eliminated. "Countryside" is a generic term and does not specifically relate to the sale of animals. "Cattle ranch" may buy animals, but it is not a common practice to sell unproductive cows to ranches. Therefore, the correct answer is "slaughterhouse," which is where animals are killed and processed for food.
hardware store | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the art project required a big wooden rod, which suggests that the item is not readily available in the immediate surroundings such as a tree stump or broom closet. The options "old clock" and "old houses" are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. A hardware store is a likely place to find a variety of wooden rods in different sizes and shapes.
succeeding | Knowledge: The sentence presents failure as the opposite of the answer, suggesting that the correct choice is a state of achievement or success. The options "completed" and "passed" suggest a one-time event, while "good at it" lacks specificity and could apply to any skill or activity. "Succeeding" and "passing" are both commonly used to describe ongoing progress and achievement, but "passing" implies a minimum standard of performance, while "succeeding" suggests a higher level of success.
wet soil | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, which suggests that moisture is playing a role here. It is a common phenomenon for worms to come out of soil when it is wet because they need moisture to breathe. If the soil becomes too compact or dry, they cannot move or breathe properly, and hence might die. Thus, it is more likely that the worms are coming out due to the presence of wet soil rather than dry soil or other wet things. The option "start to fall" seems to be unrelated to the context of the sentence.
theater | Knowledge: The options include a few different types of events, but only one of them is specifically associated with shows: the theater. A theater is a venue designed for live performances, such as plays, musicals, and comedy shows. While some of the other options may involve entertainment or performances, they do not have the same strong connection to the idea of enjoying a show as the theater does.
container | Knowledge: The question is asking where homemade food is typically stored, and the most logical option would be a container. Containers are commonly used to store food at home, whether it's in the refrigerator, freezer, or pantry. The other options, such as supermarket, jar, backpack, and Wal-Mart, do not make sense as answers since they are not typically associated with storing homemade food.
Steak house | Knowledge: Based on the context of the sentence and the choices provided, it is likely that the question is referring to a side dish that is commonly served with a meal. Potatoes are a common side dish at steak houses, often served as mashed potatoes, French fries, or baked potatoes. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with serving food or potatoes.
supermarket | Knowledge: Many supermarkets have started charging for plastic bags to reduce waste and promote reusable bags. This practice is becoming increasingly common around the world. Other options like a restaurant or Starbucks may also charge for a bag, but it's not as common. The options of closet and home are not relevant to the context of the question.
airplane hangar | Knowledge: An airplane hangar is a large building used to store aircraft. Military bases commonly have airplane hangars to keep their aircraft safe and protected from the elements when not in use. Airport terminals are for passengers and do not typically have airplane storage facilities. The sky is not a physical location to keep an airplane.
electrical device | Knowledge: A computer terminal is an electronic device that is used to interact with a computer system. It consists of a keyboard and a display screen, and is typically used for inputting commands and data into a computer, as well as for viewing its output. None of the other choices are relevant to the definition of a computer terminal.
stoic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was known for being soft and sensitive, but in a situation where everyone's wills were tested, she stood out for being different. Being stoic means showing little emotion and not easily giving in to pressure, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options all suggest the opposite of being soft and sensitive.
united states | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between the presence of dance clubs and higher rates of obesity. Since the options are locations, we need to choose the one that is most likely to have both dance clubs and high rates of obesity. The United States is a large country with a diverse population that enjoys dancing and has high rates of obesity, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are too specific to be considered a general trend.
string quartet | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific combination of instruments - a violin and three others - which is commonly associated with a string quartet. String quartets are often associated with classical music and are comprised of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The other options do not include this specific combination of instruments, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
behind | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if your opponents in a marathon are very fast, you may have difficulty keeping up with them and may fall behind. The word "behind" specifically means to not be in front of or to not keep up with others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Lightly" does not make sense in this context, "train" is not a verb that describes falling behind, "slowly" suggests moving at a leisurely pace, and "sitfast" is not a commonly used term.
sports stadium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a public place where people run and throw balls and it is hot enough to require fanning oneself. A sports stadium is a logical choice because it is a place where sporting events occur where people run and throw balls, and it could get very hot with all of the physical activity and body heat. Saunas and hot rooms are also hot, but they are not typically places where people run and throw balls in public. Living rooms and appliance stores would not normally have this type of activity taking place.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person is looking to buy frozen food in a smaller shop, indicating that they are not looking for a large supermarket or chain store. The most likely place to find a smaller shop that sells frozen food is a local grocery store. The options of refrigerator, freezer, and fridge are not relevant as they are appliances used for storing food, not purchasing it.
misfortune | Knowledge: The question asks for a word or phrase that describes a person who has bad luck. "Misfortune" is a commonly used term to describe someone who is experiencing bad luck or unfavorable circumstances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. "Schizophrenia" is a mental health condition, "fearful" describes a person who is afraid or anxious, "skills" pertains to abilities or competencies, and "criticism" refers to negative feedback or disapproval.
person's head | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was a great man who needed to maintain a certain level of grooming or appearance, which implies that the correct answer likely has to do with personal hygiene or grooming. The term "trimmed" specifically suggests hair that can be cut or styled, which again points towards hair on a person's head. The other options, such as barber shop or dog, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting revenge can bring people a certain feeling. "Satisfaction" is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of accomplishment or righting a wrong. "Being happy," "joy," and "ownership" are not commonly associated with revenge and therefore do not fit in the context of the sentence. "Disappointment" is the opposite of what the sentence is suggesting.
better circumstances | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is providing assistance with the intention of creating something positive for people. "Better circumstances" is the most general and broad option that could encompass a wide range of situations where someone might need assistance, such as financial, emotional, or physical. Happiness and learning new skills are more specific outcomes, while "people helped" is too vague and does not provide a clear goal for Dan's actions. Death is not a plausible option as it does not fit the context of the sentence.
coral reef | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that marine life needs to shelter themselves from a shark, which indicates that the shark is a predator. Coral reefs are known to provide shelter and protection for various types of marine life, including small fish and crustaceans, which may explain why they are a viable option for sheltering oneself from a shark. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
movie theatre | Knowledge: The sentence mentions eating popcorn while being entertained, which is commonly associated with watching movies. Movie theatres are typically known as places where people go to watch movies and enjoy snacks like popcorn. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
distraction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone talks too much, it has a negative impact on other people. The word "cause" indicates that there is a direct relationship between the excessive talking and another negative consequence. "Dry mouth" and "upset stomach" are physical symptoms that may be caused by anxiety or nervousness, but they are not specifically related to talking too much. "Misunderstandings" suggest a breakdown in communication, which may occur if someone is not talking clearly or if the listener is not paying attention. "Headaches" are not directly related to talking too much and are less likely to be caused by a social interaction. Therefore, "distraction" is the most appropriate choice, as talking too much can be distracting to others and disrupt their ability to focus.
basket | Knowledge: Small dogs are often associated with being carried around in baskets or small carriers, so it is logical to assume that they would like to live in a basket. A bathroom or animal shelter would not be appropriate living quarters for a small dog, and there is no indication that they would prefer to live in a big house or in Georgia specifically.
railway station | Knowledge: The phrase "board a vehicle on railing" may refer to boarding a train or other rail-based transportation, which would be done at a railway station. The other options, such as deck or porch, are not typically associated with rail transportation. A flight of stairs may be found at a railway station, but it alone does not indicate rail transportation. A bus station would be used for accessing buses, not rail-based transportation.
golf course | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where doctors are known for going during their free time. While doctors may frequent places such as medical offices or schools for work-related reasons, the other locations listed (nursing home, emergency room) are not typically associated with leisure activities. The option "golf course" is a common stereotype of doctors enjoying golfing during their off time. Therefore, it is the most likely answer.
hotel lobby | Knowledge: A revolving door is a common feature in hotel lobbies, as it allows for easy entrance and exit while also maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the building. It is less common in other locations such as banks or public places, which typically have standard doors or automatic sliding doors. While some apartment buildings may have revolving doors, it is not as common as in hotels, making hotel lobby the most likely answer. The mention of spending the night further supports the idea of a hotel lobby.
reduce | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill had to increase the gain on his audio equipment due to a problem caused by the high-impedance gear he was using. The word "cause" implies that something negative was happening as a result of the equipment, which in this case was likely a loss or reduction of volume. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
over water | Knowledge: Bridges are structures that are built to cross over bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. Therefore, the most likely answer is "over water" because the purpose of a bridge is to provide a safe and stable path over a body of water. The other options may have bodies of water present, but they do not necessarily require a bridge in order to cross or navigate them.
none of the above | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the presence or ownership of a lizard is somehow related to the income of the individual in question. However, none of the choices provided offer any insight into where one might find such a lizard. Additionally, there is no clear correlation between income and the presence of a specific type of reptile. Therefore, the correct answer is "none of the above."
faith | Knowledge: The word "agnostic" suggests that the person is uncertain or skeptical about the existence of a higher power or deity. The sentence suggests that the person has been studying science for a long time, which may have influenced their beliefs to the point where they have begun to lose faith. The other options, such as math or astronomy, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
understanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person studied self-help books, which are typically focused on self-improvement and personal growth. Therefore, it is likely that after studying such books, he gained a greater understanding of himself, his goals, and how to achieve them. The other options, such as inspiration and dreams, may also be possible outcomes of reading self-help books, but they are not as directly tied to the idea of gaining understanding or knowledge.
can smell nasty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a certain characteristic that helps in distinguishing garbage from other things. One such characteristic is a foul, unpleasant odor that garbage often emits, hence "can smell nasty" is the correct answer. The other options do not provide a clear way to distinguish garbage from other things.
multiple | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that 9 is related to 3 as a multiple, which means that 9 is a product of 3 and another whole number. This is a common concept in basic arithmetic, where multiples are used to help students understand the relationships between numbers and their factors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the context is related to travel and staying overnight somewhere. Typically, hotels provide small bottles of shampoo for their guests to use during their stay. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
concert | Knowledge: The mention of a band suggests that the event being described was a musical performance, and the fact that the electricity went out indicates that the performance was being held indoors, possibly in a venue that relied on electricity for lighting and sound equipment. The options "building", "bedroom", "opera", and "church" do not necessarily have any connection to a musical performance, while "concert" is the most likely option given the context.
vegetable stew | Knowledge: The question is asking where a potato becomes softer, indicating that it is already a potato and needs to be cooked or prepared in some way. The options "optical device," "blender," and "pantry" are clearly not related to the process of cooking or softening a potato. A garden patch is where potatoes are grown, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a potato will become softer by being in the garden. Therefore, the correct answer must be "vegetable stew," which is a dish that involves cooking vegetables, including potatoes, in liquid until they become soft and tender.
words | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that space is the most important character on a keyboard. This suggests that space has a crucial role in typing something out, and the most basic thing that one would need space for while typing is to separate individual words. The other options - paragraph, sentence, box, front - are not as basic as individual words when it comes to writing.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone forgot their shopping bag when they went to eat. Since the bag was likely intended for carrying items from a shopping trip, it is most likely to be found at a location that is related to shopping. The options "atlantis" and "closet" are unlikely since they are not related to shopping. The option "retail store" is a possibility, but the sentence implies that the person left the bag behind when they left to eat, so they likely did not go to a retail store afterwards. This leaves "grocery store" and "restaurant" as the remaining options, but since the sentence mentions that they grabbed a bit to eat, it is more likely that the bag was left behind at the restaurant rather than the grocery store.
blaring | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the radio was too loud or making too much noise, since the person complained about it. The word "blaring" specifically means to make a loud, harsh, or unpleasant sound, which would fit with the idea of someone complaining about a radio. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, since they either suggest a different action the radio could be doing, or are not related to radio at all.
control | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government can have an excess of something, and the word "sometimes" suggests that this is not always the case. The other choices, such as "Canada" and "water," do not make sense in this context. "Trouble" and "city" could be possible answers, but the word "sometimes" makes the choice of "control" more likely, as governments are often criticized for over-regulating or exerting too much control over their citizens.
stop | Knowledge: When encountering a pedestrian crossing the street while driving, it is important to stop the vehicle to allow them to cross safely. Driving in reverse may create more danger and is not a recommended action. The option for "passenger" is not related to the situation of encountering a pedestrian, and "open the window" and "walking" are also not relevant.
at a friend | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking where it is inappropriate or unacceptable to throw garbage. It is never appropriate to throw garbage at another person, such as a friend, as it can be disrespectful and harmful. The other options listed are all surfaces or receptacles where garbage is commonly disposed of.
deflation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the central bank is taking action to combat inflation. Inflation refers to a rise in general price levels across an economy, which can lead to a decrease in purchasing power for consumers and a loss of competitiveness for businesses. In contrast, deflation refers to a decrease in general price levels, which may sound like a positive development but can lead to decreased economic activity and higher unemployment. Therefore, it makes sense for the central bank to respond to inflation by taking steps to counteract it, such as adjusting interest rates or the money supply. The other options do not reflect situations that would warrant a response from the central bank in regards to inflation.
oil refineries | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the plumbing mentioned is not related to providing drinking water. Oil refineries have plumbing systems that are primarily used for processing crude oil and other materials, and are not used for providing drinking water. The other options (wall, shower, own home, water fountain) all contain plumbing systems that are used for bringing water to a tap or shower head, and therefore could potentially be used if someone was thirsty.
town | Knowledge: The fact that the police were well liked and respected suggests that they had a positive relationship with the community. The sentence also mentions that it was easier for the police to interact with the community, which implies that the community was small enough for the police to know the residents personally. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
large building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hall the person was lost in was very long, which implies that it was part of a large structure. Of the choices given, only "large building" fits this description. The other options do not necessarily have long halls, or if they do, do not require them to be part of a large structure.
child's book | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the story featuring a koala is presented through colorful pages, which is a characteristic commonly associated with children's books. The fact that the parent thinks it made for a good book further supports this idea. The other options, such as a movie or the Australian outback, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
newspaper | Knowledge: The other options do not involve print media, which is indicated by the phrase "in print form." The internet, car, and television are all electronic mediums, while books can be in print but are not typically associated with current events. Newspapers are a common source of current event information that are available in print form.
backpack | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item being described has a pocket specifically designed to hold a hydration pack filled with water. The only option that makes sense in this context is the backpack, as it is common for hiking and outdoor backpacks to have a compartment or pocket for a hydration system. The other options are unrelated to the context and have no clear connection to hydration or water.
illusion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that even if goals are reduced, failure can still occur if there is some kind of illusion or false belief about the situation. Lowering expectations or holding back may actually help prevent failure, so these options can be eliminated. "Die in a fiery car crash" is a completely unrelated option that can also be ruled out. "Amount to nothing" could be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "illusion" in the context of the sentence.
sea water | Knowledge: The question is asking about a location where there are millions of jellyfish. Jellyfish are often found in bodies of water, such as the ocean or sea. The term "smack" is sometimes used to refer to a group of jellyfish, but it is not a location. Sponge Bob's house is a fictional location and not a place where jellyfish would be found. The store is not a location where jellyfish are typically found. Therefore, the correct answer is sea water.
dog show | Knowledge: Dog shows are events where owners showcase their dogs and compete for various awards. Part of the competition includes the appearance and grooming of the dogs. Therefore, it is likely that a small dog would be well-groomed at a dog show. The other options do not provide any context that would suggest the dog would be well-groomed there.
distraction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people talking during the movie were causing a negative effect for others. Distraction is the most likely option because talking during a movie can be distracting for those trying to watch it. Headaches and sore throat are unlikely because they do not align with the context of the sentence. Misunderstandings and cell phone are also unlikely because they do not fit the context of the sentence either.
haunted house | Knowledge: Halloween is often associated with spooky and supernatural themes, including ghosts and spirits. Haunted houses are a common Halloween attraction and are designed to create a spooky and eerie atmosphere, making them a likely place to find spirits on Halloween. The other options are not typically associated with Halloween or spirits.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The question asks for the location of the closest dining table not in the person's home. The options "conference" and "card room" do not typically have dining tables, while the "living room" may have one but it would still be in the person's house. The "white house" is unrelated to the context of the question. The most likely option left is the "neighbor's house," as it suggests a location outside of the person's home where a dining table would be present.
eat quickly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mom was in a hurry and did not have time to wait for the child to eat slowly. Therefore, the child had to eat quickly in order to satisfy their hunger before leaving. The other choices do not logically follow from the context of the sentence.
Argentina | Knowledge: The question asks for the country where the Andes Mountains alphabetically starts popping up. Argentina is the first country alphabetically that the Andes Mountains pop up through. The other answer options are alphabetically after Argentina.
box | Knowledge: Tying a ribbon around a gift box is a common and popular practice when giving presents. Floral arrangements may have ribbons around them, but it is not as common as tying ribbons around gift boxes. Tying a ribbon around a girl's hair is possible, but it is not as common as tying a ribbon around a gift box. Tying a ribbon around a car or typewriter does not make much sense in the context of giving presents.
ancient Rome | Knowledge: The mention of a "stone arch" suggests that the question is referring to architectural or engineering feats. The use of the word "ancient" further narrows down the possible choices to civilizations that existed long ago. Of the given choices, only ancient Rome is known for its intricate and impressive feats of engineering and architecture, including famous stone arches such as the Arch of Titus and the Arch of Constantine. The other choices (foot, cathedral, building, my bathroom) do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
barn | Knowledge: Milking machines are commonly used in agricultural settings, particularly in barns where cows are milked. The other options, such as an office or a bar, do not have any clear association with milking machines. Industrial areas may be a possibility, but it is still more likely that a milking machine would be found in a barn where cows are kept. A museum may display historical milking machines, but it is unlikely that they would actually be used there.
constellation | Knowledge: The context suggests that the star is lonely and wishing to be a part of something. It is most likely referring to a group or pattern of stars, which is what a constellation is. Hollywood, atmosphere, and solar system do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Night sky could potentially fit, but it doesn't convey a sense of belonging in the way that constellation does.
university | Knowledge: The use of the word "analyzed" suggests a more formal setting, and out of the given choices, a university is the most likely place for someone to be analyzed or studied in an academic context. The other options do not have a clear connection to a formal academic setting. A bookstore and speakeasy are unlikely places for a formal analysis of a poet's work to be happening, while home and classroom are not specific enough to determine if it's a formal setting or not.
better knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a teacher is trying to teach or share something with their class. The phrase "better knowledge" implies that the teacher is attempting to improve the students' understanding or increase their knowledge on a particular topic. The other options do not fit the context of a teacher trying to impart knowledge to their class. "Group students" and "time test" do not make sense in this context, and "suffering" and "state facts" do not imply the goal of teaching or sharing knowledge.
weak | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is strong and morally upright, which makes it likely that they would want to protect someone who is weaker or in need of protection. The word "weak" directly contrasts with the idea of strength, and the other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence. Batman is a fictional character and not relevant to the sentence, while "diluted," "fragile," and "regular" don't provide clear criteria for who needs protection.
south | Knowledge: The sentence refers to the origin of slaves during the time of European slavery, suggesting that they were taken from a specific location. "South" likely refers to the African continent, which was a major source of slaves for European countries during this time period. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not relevant to the topic of slavery or the transportation of slaves.
better communication | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that there are advantages to learning a language specifically for business settings. One of the main benefits of learning a language for business is that it can significantly improve communication with foreign clients or partners. This can lead to greater success in negotiations and a more collaborative relationship overall. The other options (happiness, problems, confidence, comfortness) do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, and are less likely to be a primary reason for learning a language for business.
go somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kids were enthusiastic about getting ready and getting in the car, which implies that they were excited about going somewhere. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - expressing information, dancing, going to the library or fixing the car are not activities that would typically elicit excitement from kids getting ready to leave the house.
search on internet | Knowledge: The question suggests that the student is looking for the answer to a question they do not know. Out of all the options, searching on the internet is the most likely way to quickly find the answer to a question. The other options do not give any direction on how to find the answer to the question, as completing the test or learning to read won't necessarily help with finding the answer to the specific question. Asking questions or reading a book may be helpful, but searching on the internet can often provide faster and more direct results.
study | Knowledge: Learning is an active process that involves deliberate effort to acquire new knowledge, skills, or abilities. Study refers to the act of applying oneself to acquire knowledge or understanding of a particular subject or topic by reading, researching, or practicing. Attention and thought are necessary for learning, but they do not necessarily involve the active process of studying. Exposure may lead to learning, but it is not as direct or intentional as studying.
complete writing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that authors have a strong emotional reaction when they finish something related to writing. The phrase "complete writing" suggests that the authors have finished writing either a book, a story, or an article, and they feel a range of emotions from relief to happiness. The other answer choices do not convey the same meaning and are not in line with the context of the sentence.
desk | Knowledge: The question is asking where there are likely to be multiple desk drawers, indicating that the answer needs to be a location where desks are often found with more than one drawer. The options "holding office supplies," "room," "office," and "school" do not necessarily imply the presence of desks or drawers, whereas "desk" specifically refers to a piece of furniture with drawers used for work or study.
It could be any of the options, as the sentence does not provide any specific contextual clues as to what type of vessel James used to hold the liquid. The choice would depend on personal preference or the availability of containers.
aircraft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the generals are looking to drop bombs from above, which is typically done using an aircraft. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
interaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that loneliness is a common problem among residents in facilities for the elderly, and therefore they are likely in need of some form of social engagement or interaction. The other options, such as plants or respiration, do not directly address the issue of loneliness and would not necessarily alleviate the problem. Additionally, the options expiration and perspiration do not make sense in the context of the question.
feeling of guilt | Knowledge: The question suggests that the act of killing someone is seen as a negative action that may be followed by negative consequences. A common emotional response to taking another person's life is a feeling of guilt, which may be amplified if the person is seen as a "good" or moral individual. The other options (Michigan, dies, being imprisoned, bloody mess) do not relate to the expected emotional response after committing such an act.
depression | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was reflecting on her failures in life and her emotional state as a result of this reflection was likely negative. Depression is a common emotional response to feelings of failure or disappointment. The other options, such as knowledge or confused, are not typically associated with emotional responses to personal failures.
conclusion | Knowledge: Discovering truth is often the ultimate goal of research, which usually occurs at the conclusion of the process. This is when the researcher has gathered and analyzed all of their data, weighed the evidence, and drawn their conclusions. The other options do not have a clear connection to the process of research or the goal of discovering truth.
stairwell | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the elderly person needs assistance pulling themselves up from a certain area in their home, which suggests that the area is not on the ground level. Stairwells are commonly found in homes with multiple levels and are a likely candidate for where an elderly person may need to install a railing for support. Decks and houses may also require railings for safety, but not necessarily for assistance in pulling oneself up. Feet is not a logical answer as it is a body part rather than an installation, and a flight of stairs is too vague and could refer to any set of stairs.
construction site | Knowledge: A beam is a structural element used in construction, typically made of wood or steel. It is often created on a construction site as part of the building process. The other options, such as ceiling or train station, may have beams present, but they are not typically created at those locations. Large buildings and warehouses may have been built with beams, but they would not be created there.
lower blood pressure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was instructed to do something specific in order to improve his health, which is likely related to his blood pressure. Relaxing, lying back and sleeping may be methods to lower blood pressure, but they may not be the specific instruction that John was given. Feeling happy is not necessarily related to blood pressure, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
office | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the receptionist lady works in an office setting, as she uses a rubber stamp on her notes. The other options (art class, indiana, insane asylum) do not have any clear connection to the use of a rubber stamp in an office setting. The word "desk" could potentially be a correct answer, as it is also associated with an office setting, but it is less likely than "office" as it is too specific and narrow in scope.
breaking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person hit the bottle with force, enough to cause pain in their hand. It is likely that the impact would also cause the bottle to break. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
human body | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people of faith believe that the human body is a vessel for the soul, which is a concept commonly associated with various religions. The human body is often viewed as a temporary home for the soul, which will eventually leave the body after death. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fulfilling | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was able to see their idea come to life, which is likely to be a fulfilling and satisfying experience. The other options do not match the positive tone of the sentence and are therefore not likely to be the correct answer. "Sad" is unlikely as it is the opposite of what one would feel when experiencing their idea becoming a reality. "Very nice" and "inspiration" are too vague and do not capture the emotional state of the person accurately. "Make money" is not mentioned in the sentence and is therefore not relevant.
street corner | Knowledge: The sentence states that John runs a "small corner shop", which implies that the shop is located on a street corner. This means that the correct answer is "street corner", while the other options do not have any relevance to the location of the shop.
entertaining | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the movies being referred to are trying to achieve a specific goal, which is to provide enjoyment to the audience through unexpected and lighthearted events. The word "entertaining" is the most appropriate choice to describe this intention. The other options, such as "clever," "excellent," and "watched by people," do not directly relate to the tone or content of the movies being described. While the movies may be intended to be "funny," this term does not capture the full range of what they are trying to achieve.
pharmacy | Knowledge: Contraceptives are typically sold at drug stores or pharmacies, as they are over-the-counter products that do not require a prescription. Medicine cabinets are not a place to purchase contraceptives, as they are typically only used to store medications that have already been purchased. A doctor's office may prescribe contraceptives, but they do not typically sell them directly to patients. The option "vagina" is not a place to purchase contraceptives, as they are not sold directly through the body.
tear up | Knowledge: When someone is experiencing strong emotions, such as sadness or joy, their body can produce tears. This is commonly referred to as "tearing up" or "crying" and is a natural physiological response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that watching a favorite show is a way to unwind after a tiring day. The options "smile," "buy tickets," "laugh," and "succeed" do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the act of relaxing.
advance | Knowledge: The question is asking about the benefits of learning about a subject. Learning about a subject can help individuals advance their knowledge and understanding in that area, allowing them to potentially excel in that field. The other options do not make logical sense in answering the question, as forming opinions and changing can be subjective, headaches are not a benefit, and starting reproduction is not relevant to learning about a subject.
discussion | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the group of friends have gathered together after reading a book, which suggests that they may want to talk about the book and share their thoughts and opinions. The word "discussion" best describes an activity that involves exchanging ideas and thoughts with others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "learn things" and "learning" are vague and not specific to the situation, "fit" does not relate to the book or the gathering, and "nightmares" is not a likely outcome of a book discussion.
went to restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Josh was feeling hungry and needed to satisfy his hunger. The most likely option for him to do in this situation would be to go to a restaurant where he can buy food. The other options, such as bringing home fish or making bread, would require more preparation and may not be possible or practical in that moment. Going to the market or cooking dinner would also take more time and effort than simply going to a restaurant.
head | Knowledge: Hats are typically worn on the head. The other options do not correspond to the location where hats are worn.
enjoy movie | Knowledge: The use of the word "couples" suggests that the context is about a movie that is geared towards both men and women, rather than something more specifically aimed at one gender. The phrase "mostly couples" implies that the movie is something that both partners can enjoy together, rather than being solely focused on the preferences of one gender. The other options are all sexual in nature and do not fit the context of the sentence.
living room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to place their chesterfield (a type of sofa) near their magazine rack, which is typically found in a living room. Ashtrays are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and a museum or foyer would not typically have a personal chesterfield and magazine rack. Derbyshire is a location and not a piece of furniture.
get tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trainer is instructing the person to continue doing a specific exercise until they reach a certain point, which seems to be getting tired. This could indicate that the exercise is meant to be challenging or endurance-building, and continuing until tiredness is a sign that progress is being made. The other options do not necessarily relate to this context, and could be seen as distracting or irrelevant to the sentence.
answering questions | Knowledge: The question is asking about what teachers often do after teaching a lesson, suggesting that there is a common practice or routine. The option "answering questions" is the most likely choice, as teachers typically allow students to ask questions after a lesson to clarify any confusion or reinforce the material taught. The other options, such as "pop quiz" or "teach children," do not necessarily follow the pattern of what teachers do after teaching a lesson.
restaurant | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker lives in a small town and is looking for a nice place to eat. The most logical option would be a restaurant, as dining rooms and shopping areas may not necessarily have high-quality restaurants. Mars is clearly not a viable option for dining out, and big cities may not be accessible or desirable for someone living in a small town.
compare prices | Knowledge: When people are deciding what to buy at a shop, they often compare prices of different items to determine which one offers the best value for their money. This helps them make a more informed decision based on their budget and the quality of the product they are interested in buying. "Spending of money" and "purchasing" are too general and could apply to any aspect of shopping, while "have fun" and "splurge" are more focused on the experience of shopping rather than the decision-making process.
casing | Knowledge: The cartridge of a bullet is the part that contains the bullet, gunpowder, and primer. The casing is the outer metal shell that holds everything together and is usually made of brass or other metals. The other options are not related to the cartridge of a bullet, with bandolier being a type of ammunition holder, gun shop being a place that sells guns, magazine being a device that holds multiple cartridges, and gunpowder being a component inside the cartridge.
warehouse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the grain-seller required a place for storage that is dry, which leads to the conclusion that the correct answer should be something different from "wet". While "pantry" and "storage closet" are both possible options for dry storage, the word "building" is too broad and does not specifically suggest a dry storage environment. Therefore, "warehouse" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a large, enclosed storage area that can protect the grains from moisture while allowing for easier access and organization.
sparks fly | Knowledge: The question suggests that flirting has a positive outcome, and the phrase "primal basics" indicates a natural or instinctual reaction. "Sparks fly" is a common expression used to describe the excitement and chemistry between two people who are attracted to each other. The other options do not have the same positive connotation or relationship to flirting.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that shower curtains are commonly used in a certain location, which is likely to be a place where many people stay temporarily. Hotels are a common location where shower curtains would be used in multiple rooms, while options like police station or dime store do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sell drugs | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a drug dealer engages in the act of selling drugs. While they may also supply drugs, this option is not as commonly used as "selling" drugs. The mention of prison and jail may suggest that drug dealing is an illegal activity, so it is more likely that the dealer would frequent areas where they can sell drugs discreetly. A nightclub is less likely to be a location where drug dealing takes place openly or easily.
retribution | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dave is discussing punishment and is opposed to punishing someone for making a mistake. The word "just" indicates that he believes the punishment would be unfair or unjust. The choices "hatred," "feel sorry for," "feel guilty," and "funny" are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not convey the meaning of being opposed to punishment. "Retribution" is the only choice that specifically refers to punishment for wrongdoing.
lady | Knowledge: This question refers to an old social custom where men were expected to walk on the outer edge of a sidewalk when walking with a lady. This was done to protect the lady from passing carriages or other dangers that may have been present on the street. The other options such as gods, boys, female group, and father do not have any relevant connection to this social custom.
rural area | Knowledge: A floating cottage is a type of houseboat that can typically be found in rural areas with bodies of water such as lakes or rivers. The other options - fairy story, desert, village, and mountains - do not provide a suitable setting for a floating cottage. A fairy story might include magical elements, but a floating cottage doesn't fit the traditional motifs of most fairy stories. A desert, with its lack of water, would not be a suitable environment for a floating cottage. A village might have a river or lake nearby, but it's less likely to have houseboats. And while a mountain lake may exist, the climate and terrain don't lend themselves to houseboats. Rural areas are usually the best bet.
globular cluster | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that older stars in the outer regions of a galaxy form groups. The term "globular cluster" is commonly used in astronomy to describe such groups of stars. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "night sky," "black hole," and "heavens" are broad terms that do not relate specifically to older stars or their grouping. "Press conference" is completely unrelated to astronomy.
church | Knowledge: A bishop is a term commonly used in the religious context, particularly in Christianity. In this context, a bishop is a high-ranking member of the church hierarchy who oversees a certain geographic area or diocese. Since the question is asking about how a bishop moves from one place to another, it is logical to assume that the term "move" refers to the bishop's official travel within their diocese. In this context, the correct answer would be "church" as bishops often travel from one church to another within their diocese to conduct services or meet with their clergy. The other options are not relevant to this religious context.
making more money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer is gaining more land, which implies that they will have more space to grow crops or raise livestock. This would allow them to produce more and potentially increase their profits, leading to the expected positive consequence of making more money. The other options do not make logical sense as a positive consequence of gaining more land. Disputes, more work, more responsibility, and higher taxes would all be negative consequences.
saucepan | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a warning about burning one's hand on the handle of a small, high-walled vessel. This generally describes a saucepan, which is commonly used for cooking on a stovetop. The other options do not have handles that are typically high-walled or require a warning about potential burns.
have energy | Knowledge: Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day because it gives the body the energy it needs to start the day. By eating breakfast, individuals are providing their bodies with necessary nutrients and fuel that can help them feel more energized and alert. The other options do not accurately reflect the purpose of breakfast, as the focus is more on satisfying hunger or indulging in food rather than providing energy for the day.
ankle sprain | Knowledge: Jumping rope is a physical activity that involves repeated impact on the feet, ankles, and legs. An ankle sprain is a common injury resulting from jumping rope, as the constant jumping and landing can put a lot of stress on the ankle joint. Looking silly, sweating, high cholesterol, and becoming tired may be results of jumping rope, but they are not injuries.
eyes | Knowledge: Cats have a highly developed sense of sight, especially in low light conditions, due to their large pupils and reflective tapetum lucidum layer in their eyes. This allows them to see in the dark much better than humans can. Therefore, the most likely feature of a cat that can be seen in the dark would be their eyes. The other options, such as litter of kittens, four legs, nose, and flippers do not have any clear connection to the characteristics of cats that would be visible in the dark.
mansion | Knowledge: A "walk-in type wardrobe" generally refers to a large, separate closet area that one can walk into and browse clothing racks and shelves. This type of wardrobe is more commonly found in larger homes or mansions, where space is not as much of an issue. Recreational vehicles and clothes cupboards are unlikely to have this type of feature, and a regular house or bedroom may or may not have a walk-in wardrobe depending on the size and design.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Bobby found the lamp in a place where he had been sleeping, which suggests that the lamp was most likely located in his bedroom. The other options (building, house, store, ocean) do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to find a lamp beside oneself after waking up.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was keeping his school books in a place where he could easily access them when he wanted to study, which implies that the location was in his home. The options "cabinet," "school building," "bank," and "bookstore" do not fit this context, as they are all separate places from Joe's home. Therefore, the most probable location where Joe's shelf would be placed is his bedroom.
get somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man was in a hurry, which suggests that he had a destination or goal in mind. The options "run away" and "accident" both suggest negative circumstances, which do not fit the context of the sentence. "Pleasure" is unlikely because the sentence does not suggest that the man was enjoying himself, and "falling down" is not a logical consequence of riding a bike quickly. Therefore, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable choice.
mind | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the doctor's were trying to decipher something related to the mental patient's confusion, which is a symptom commonly associated with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The other options, such as class, war, and opera, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be correct answers. The meaning of life may seem like a plausible option, but it is not directly related to the mental patient's confusion in the sentence.
stressed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a baby can lead to stress due to the baby crying. Crying is a common behavior of newborns, which can lead to sleep deprivation and other stressors for new parents. While the other options may also be associated with starting a family, they do not directly relate to the issue of crying babies that the sentence presents.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the family preferred a carpeted living space, which is most commonly found in bedrooms. Carpeting is less common in other areas, such as the gym or near the fireplace, where hard flooring may be more practical. Istanbul, being a location, is not relevant to the sentence. Houses is too broad and does not specify where the carpet was placed.
mystical experience | Knowledge: Going into a trance is often associated with altered states of consciousness and spiritual experiences. A mystical experience refers to a sense of unity or connectedness with the universe, a feeling of being at one with everything around you. This is a common outcome of trance states, which may include meditation, hypnosis or drug-induced altered states. Confusion, sleepwalking, and memory loss are not typically associated with trance states, while peacefulness may be a possibility, but not as closely related as a mystical experience.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was using the dictionary as a makeshift support for a table that was wobbly. It is common for people to put objects like books or dictionaries under wobbly table legs to stabilize them. The other options are not mentioned in the sentence and do not have any clear connection to the context.
basement | Knowledge: The fact that the house had expensive insurance suggests that there was a high risk of damage or loss. The mention of an established history of flooding further supports this idea. Flooding commonly occurs in basements, especially in areas that are prone to heavy rain or near bodies of water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk or filing cabinet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the files are still being worked on, so they need to be easily accessible. Desks and filing cabinets are common places to keep current files, as they are easily reachable and can be organized in a way that makes sense for the work being done. Hard disks, drawers, and computers may be used to store files, but they are not specifically designed for easy access while actively working on them.
coffee | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people add sugar to a certain black beverage, which is a common practice for coffee. Coffee is a popular beverage that is often consumed with sugar to balance its bitterness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stress | Knowledge: The word "punishing" suggests that the work schedule is difficult and demanding, which can lead to stress. Stress is a common response to work overload and can result in a range of physical and emotional symptoms. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence or are extreme outcomes that may not necessarily be the result of a punishing work schedule.
offices | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the employees were complaining about a lack of air conditioning in their workplace, which would most likely be an office. The other options (tables, movie theatre, car, house) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
fatigue | Knowledge: The word "energy" suggests that the question is asking about a physical state rather than a scientific concept. When we run out of energy, we typically feel tired and lacking in physical strength, which is commonly referred to as fatigue. The other options (matter, mass) are scientific concepts that do not relate to the physical state of being tired. Deprived and weakness are closer in meaning to fatigue, but they do not accurately capture the specific sensation of feeling physically drained.
shower stall | Knowledge: Mildew is a type of fungus that grows in damp environments. A shower stall is an area of the bathroom that is often damp and humid, which makes it a prime location for mildew growth. Toenails, mushrooms, cave, and basement do not have the necessary moisture and humidity that mildew requires to grow, so they are less likely to be a common location for mildew.
investigation | Knowledge: The word "following" suggests that the police are starting a process after a crime has been committed. Since the question is asking what the police are "likely to begin," it suggests that the answer is the first step in the process of addressing the crime. "Man hunt," "punishment," "going to jail," and "retribution" are all steps that may happen after the police have completed their investigation, while "investigation" is the logical first step in understanding the circumstances of the crime.
read book | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child needs to pass the time quietly, which implies an activity that is not particularly active or noisy. The option "read book" fits this description, as it is a quiet and solitary activity that can keep a child occupied for long periods of time. The other options do not fit this description - "brood" implies a negative and introspective state of mind, "become adult" is not an activity but a gradual process of growing up, "ask questions" may require interaction with others and therefore may not be quiet, and "clean room" may require physical activity and make some noise.
united states | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individuals are planning a road trip that will take them across a country or region. The option "united states" is the most fitting choice as it is a well-known country with a vast network of highways that can take travelers across the entire nation. The other options do not provide a clear indication of where the road trip is taking place or which highways will be used.
communism | Knowledge: The word "cast aside" suggests that the context is negative or detrimental to freedom. Slavery and captivity are both forms of oppression and are more directly related to the restriction of freedom rather than its cast-aside nature. "Evil" and "good" are too vague to be a clear answer. Communism is historically associated with oppressive regimes that prioritize the state over the individual, which can lead to restrictions on personal freedoms.
experience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the religious man is talking about his personal relationship with faith, indicating that it is something that he has gone through or felt, rather than just believed in intellectually. The use of the word "only" also implies that this is something unique to the individual, not something that can be shared or taught. "Dream" and "light way" do not have a clear connection to the concept of faith, and "belief" and "trust" suggest a more intellectual or abstract understanding of faith rather than a personal experience of it.
person | Knowledge: The context of this sentence suggests that the surgeons were performing an operation in a medical setting, as blood is commonly associated with surgical procedures. The option "person" is the most likely answer, as surgeries are typically done on human patients. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
eat vegetables | Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat is a carnivore, which means that they primarily eat meat. This knowledge helps eliminate the choices "get wet," "wool sweater," and "sharp claws" as they are not related to the diet of a cat. The correct choice is "eat vegetables" as it directly contradicts with the fact that a cat is a carnivore since they do not eat vegetables. The final option, "hunt prey," is not the correct answer as it is actually a behavior that is associated with being a carnivore.
department store | Knowledge: A department store typically offers a wide range of products including clothing, accessories, home decor, and electronics, making it a good option for finding a gift for someone you barely know. Specialty stores usually focus on a specific type of product or theme, which may not necessarily be what the person is interested in. A Christmas tree and lost and found have no relevance to finding a gift, and a party may not necessarily have any options for a gift.
cell | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the membrane being referred to is a cell membrane. Cell membranes are often observed through magnification as they are too small to be seen with the naked eye. The membrane serves to protect the cell and regulate the entry and exit of substances, which is why it is a crucial component of a cell. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being single | Knowledge: Divorce legally ends a marriage, making the individual's current status single. While divorce can be a difficult and emotionally taxing experience, the other options listed do not accurately describe one's marital status after a divorce.
music store | Knowledge: A keyboard is a musical instrument, so it would make sense to look for one at a music store. An office or school would not typically have musical instruments available. The classifieds or online marketplaces may have used or secondhand keyboards available, but a music store would be the most reliable option for purchasing a new keyboard. A landfill would not be a place to acquire a keyboard.
mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place where they can buy clothes as well as other things, which is a characteristic commonly associated with malls. Malls typically have a variety of stores, including clothing stores, as well as restaurants, entertainment options, and other stores selling a variety of goods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
amsterdam | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that canals are a prominent feature of a location in Northern Europe, which is a characteristic commonly associated with Amsterdam. Amsterdam is known for its intricate network of canals, which serve as an important part of the city's transportation system and are also popular tourist attractions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James needed to purchase a new lamp, which suggests that he would need to go to a place where lamps are sold. A store is a common location for purchasing household items such as lamps, while the other choices do not necessarily have a direct connection to purchasing a lamp.
main office | Knowledge: A "master control" is likely a central hub for controlling and monitoring various technological systems within a company. The most likely place for this hub to be located is the main office, as this is where the majority of a company's administrative and managerial functions are typically carried out. The other options, such as a beach or basement, are unlikely locations for a master control hub.
alcoholism | Knowledge: The phrase "hitting the bottle" is commonly used to refer to excessive drinking of alcohol. Therefore, if a person spends a lot of time "hitting the bottle" it can be inferred that they may have a problem with alcohol consumption, which is a characteristic associated with alcoholism. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the phrase and are not related to excessive drinking.
on jury | Knowledge: In a court trial, a group of people known as the jury is responsible for reviewing evidence and deliberating on a verdict. They then pass a sentence based on the verdict they have arrived at. The other options (such as "sure," "judgemental," and "mom") do not have any connection to the function of a court or the legal system.
think ahead | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the other person is able to predict the speaker's moves in chess, indicating a level of strategic planning. The phrase "think ahead" is commonly used in chess to refer to anticipating future moves and considering possible outcomes. The other options do not relate to chess strategy or planning.
parking lot | Knowledge: The presence of a large trash can suggests that the building is likely in an area where there is a lot of garbage generated, such as a parking lot. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. For example, a subway station may have trash cans, but they are typically smaller and spread out along the platform, rather than in front of a single building.
shameful | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person's behavior caused embarrassment to themselves and their family. The word "shameful" is often used to describe actions or behavior that are deemed inappropriate or unacceptable in social situations, and would likely result in feelings of embarrassment, guilt or remorse. The other options do not convey the same meaning as the context of the sentence.
pregnancy | Knowledge: Pregnancy is often associated with weight gain and fatigue, which could cause someone to go to bed early. Additionally, hormonal changes can stimulate appetite and lead to increased calorie intake. The other options are less likely to cause weight gain and early bedtime. Drowsiness and sleeping in could be signs of fatigue, but do not necessarily lead to weight gain. Insomnia typically causes sleeplessness, not earlier bedtimes. Exercise may lead to weight loss and improved sleep patterns.
better comprehension | Knowledge: The question asks about the goal of the activities of students, which implies that there is a purpose or objective behind these activities. The phrase "better comprehension" suggests that these activities are designed to help students gain a better understanding of a particular subject or topic. The other options are possible goals for students, but they do not necessarily address the broader objective of improving comprehension.
freedom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the victim is being held captive by a twisted kidnapper who has made a deal with them. The only way for the victim to gain something seems to be by killing someone, which implies that the kidnapper is offering them a way to escape or gain their freedom. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the concept of someone being held captive or needing to kill someone to gain something.
gaining knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that attending a lecture given by an expert will result in something positive. The options "inspiration," "getting bored," and "drowsiness" are unlikely to be positive outcomes of attending a lecture given by an expert, while "gaining knowledge" is a common expectation of attending a lecture. Therefore, the correct answer is "gaining knowledge."
weakness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy had a flaw or vulnerability that the villain was able to use against him, which points to the correct answer being "weakness". "Definitely" and "will" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, while "wont" is a less common and less relevant word choice.
electric typewriter | Knowledge: The sentence mentions an electric motor and a keyboard, which are both features commonly associated with electric typewriters. Electric fans, drum sanders, electric refrigerators, and electric locomotives do not typically use keyboards or have a connection to writing or printing, making them unlikely answers.
lie | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that most people don't say what they mean and that they twist their words to avoid conflict. This behavior can be described as dishonest or deceptive, which is commonly associated with lying. The other options, such as setting a table, thinking, reading books, and not speaking, are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide an appropriate answer.
baggage compartment | Knowledge: When traveling by air, passengers typically check their luggage and it is stored in the baggage compartment of the airplane. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the storage of luggage during air travel.
liquid | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a flask is a type of container, and the word "hold" implies that something is intended to be placed inside it. Among the choices given, "liquid" is the most likely option for what a flask would be designed to hold. The other choices, such as "fire," "garage," or "contain food," do not make sense in this context.
corner  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the irregular shape of the shelf could potentially be a hazard in high-traffic areas. This implies that the shelf should be placed in a location where it is less likely to be bumped into or obstruct the flow of foot traffic. A corner location would allow the shelf to be out of the way, but still accessible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
buy food | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Alexa needs money to obtain food since she left her wallet at home. John gives her a twenty-dollar bill to enable her to purchase food, which is the most likely option among the choices provided. The other options, such as borrowing, having, or preparing food, suggest alternative ways of obtaining food that do not require money.
discovery | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Jamie had never played an instrument before and that starting to fiddle was an exciting thing for her. This suggests that the answer is related to the experience of discovering something new. Dancing, being happy, and square dancing are not directly related to the context in the sentence. A snapped fiddle string may have been frustrating or disappointing, but it does not fit the description of something that Jamie found thrilling.
person's hand | Knowledge: The options suggest different places where tickets might be used, and the most common place to put a ticket would be in a person's hand to show proof of admission or purchase. At an amusement park, movie theater, train station, or baseball stadium, a ticket may be required to enter or access certain areas. However, simply having a ticket does not guarantee entry without it being presented to an attendant or scanned. Therefore, the correct answer would be a person's hand where the ticket can be easily accessed and presented when needed.
thank god | Knowledge: The question is asking for a religious practice or action that a Christian might do in response to receiving what they needed. "Thank god" is a common expression of gratitude to a higher power in Christianity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
sell beer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the women were working in a setting where selling beer was a possibility, and that they were using their sex appeal to help sell the product. This is a common marketing tactic used in the beer industry, where attractive women are sometimes used to promote the product. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
bar | Knowledge: In most cases, alcohol is served in a mug at a bar, which is a place that specializes in serving alcoholic beverages. A juice bar typically only serves non-alcoholic drinks, and a store or cupboard would not be a typical location for serving alcohol. A cabinet may refer to a type of furniture or storage unit, but it is not a location where one would typically be served alcohol.
die at home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a strong dislike for hospitals, which may indicate that they preferred to be in a different environment for the end of their life. The option "die at home" aligns with this preference and is a common wish for those who want to spend their final moments in a familiar and comfortable setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
part company | Knowledge: The question is asking for a behavior that people exhibit when they do not like each other. "Part company" is a common phrase used to describe the action of separating from someone when a relationship is no longer amicable. The other options do not fit the context of the question and are unlikely behaviors when two people do not like each other.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Joe had access to a rented locker, which is a commodity usually associated with hotels. Bus depots and airports may also offer locker rentals, but they are not as commonly recognized for this service as hotels. "Own home" and "pocket" are unlikely choices because it is not usual to rent a locker in your own home or carry a locker key in your pocket. "Idea" is not related to the question and is not a viable choice.
carrying goods | Knowledge: The purpose of a shopping basket is to carry goods while shopping. It is a convenient and lightweight option for carrying smaller items that do not require a cart. The other options are related to the context of shopping, but do not specifically address the purpose of a shopping basket.
use glass | Knowledge: Using a glass is a common way to drink something politely or formally. Glassware is often used in formal settings, such as at weddings or fancy dinners. The other options do not make sense in the context of drinking politely or formally - opening your mouth is not an appropriate vessel, eating first is unrelated, buying alcohol is irrelevant if the question is about drinking politely, and a coffee mug is not generally used in formal settings.
learn more about |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam is interested in the thing and wants to examine it closely in order to gain more knowledge about it. The option "learn more about" reflects this idea directly. "Interesting" and "interests" are both nouns and do not reflect what Sam wants to do. "Complex" is an adjective and does not reflect Sam's intent. "Go to bed" is unlikely to be the correct answer given the context of the sentence.
strikes | Knowledge: In baseball, a missed swing is typically referred to as a strike, which is one of the ways a batter can be called out. The other options do not accurately describe the situation of missing a swing in baseball. Injury, agony, sore muscles, and pain may all occur as a result of playing the sport, but they are not specifically related to missing a swing.
Austria | Knowledge: The Danube river passes through multiple countries, including Austria, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Croatia). However, the question asks for the current country that contains the river, and Austria is the only option that is currently a country and contains a section of the Danube. Czechoslovakia is no longer a country, and the Nile is a river in Africa, not Europe.
guillotine | Knowledge: The context of the question refers to the French Revolution, a turbulent time in French history characterized by radical political and social upheaval. The use of the term "cut through royal necks" suggests a violent and deadly approach to punishing those in power. The guillotine was famously used during the French Revolution to execute thousands of individuals, including King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette. The other options do not align with the context of the question or historical knowledge of the French Revolution.
ask questions | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the student was experiencing difficulty with finding information in the book, which implies that they are seeking help or clarification. In an academic setting, it is common for students to raise their hand and ask questions when they do not fully understand a concept or are struggling with a task. This makes "ask questions" the most logical answer choice. "Learn" is not a specific action that serves to address the student's problem, "turn pages" is not necessarily helpful in finding specific information, "death" is completely irrelevant to the context, and "go to school" is too general and doesn't address the specific issue.
sadness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while James and Ruth's divorce was not acrimonious, it was still a difficult and emotional experience. The use of the word "amicable" implies that there was not a lot of bitterness or anger involved, but the description of the situation as "not happy" suggests that both parties were likely feeling sad or upset about the end of their marriage. The other options may also be applicable to a divorce, but do not fit as well with the specific language used in the sentence.
carpet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny wants to improve the appearance of his floor, which often involves covering it with a material that is aesthetically pleasing, like carpet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
field with tennis court | Knowledge: A tennis game requires a tennis court and the only option that mentions a tennis court is "field with tennis court." "Match" and "progress" do not refer to a location, while "park" and "highschool" do not specify if they have tennis courts. Therefore, "field with tennis court" is the correct choice.
emergency room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a wound that requires urgent care. Urgent care is a medical treatment that requires immediate attention, which would logically lead an individual to go to the emergency room. The hospital option is a vague option as different hospitals have different departments and services. Body and patient are not locations and injury does not provide any clear direction as to where to go.
interesting | Knowledge: The word "dull" implies boredom or lack of interest. If something is fixed, it would become more engaging and captivating, hence "interesting" would be the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of something being "dull". "Sharp" could make sense if something was physically dull, like a knife or a blade, but in this case, it is unclear what is being referred to.
good review | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person had a positive experience at the restaurant, and upon returning home, he did something to express his satisfaction. The most common way to do this is by leaving a good review on a website, such as Yelp or Google Reviews. The other options, such as owning a house or having loyal friends, do not make sense in this context and are unrelated to the experience at the restaurant. Fever and with cat do not fit the situation at all.
late payment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Greg incurred some sort of penalty or fee related to his inability to pay a cash advance fee. The phrase "dinged for" implies that this penalty was negative or costly. Based on the available choices, the most likely penalty for failure to pay a fee would be a late payment fee, as this is a common penalty for missed or overdue payments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feelings of guilt | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a moral or ethical reason why killing people is wrong, and suggests that the person who is doing the killing may not feel guilty or remorseful about it. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "feelings of guilt." The other options (prison sentence, going to jail, die, hunger) are consequences that may result from the action of killing people, but they do not explain why the person is doing it in the first place.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The sentence uses the word "relaxing" and "not doing anything" together, which suggests a state of relaxation that could lead to sleepiness. The option "shut eyes" is not a plausible answer as it is only a description of a physical action that could happen during relaxation, rather than an outcome. "Listening to music" and "reading" may also be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily lead to falling asleep. Therefore, "falling asleep" is the correct answer.
wet | Knowledge: The question mentions someone spraying another person with a hose. This action commonly results in someone becoming wet, as the water from the hose will soak their clothing and skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
quality time | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man is using the TV as a distraction or means of avoiding something. The use of the word "instead" suggests that the man is choosing TV over another activity, which is likely spending quality time with his wife. The other options, such as getting fat, entertainment, and wasting time, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not involve the man's relationship with his wife. Arguments could be a possibility, but the use of the word "avoiding" suggests that the man is actively trying to prevent a negative interaction.
tree | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman can hear the small dog, which means that the dog must be in a location where it can make noise, such as barking or whimpering. Out of the provided choices, a tree is the only location where a small dog could potentially climb and make vocalizations while staying hidden from the woman's view. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stomach | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the smell of the food made Joe feel a physical reaction in his body. The most logical body part likely to experience such a reaction is his stomach, as it is directly related to the ingestion and digestion of food. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
depression | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that stress can have a negative impact on a person's mood, and can sometimes lead to a more serious mental health issue such as depression. While stress can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches and high blood pressure, the word "mood" implies a more emotional response. Depression is a common condition associated with prolonged stress, and can have a debilitating impact on a person's mental and physical wellbeing. Fatigue can also be a consequence of stress, but it is not specifically linked to mood changes in the sentence. Heart attacks are a more extreme outcome of high blood pressure, which is not always a direct result of stress.
bladders | Knowledge: The sentence is discussing human anatomy and specifically refers to the storage of urine. The bladder is the organ responsible for storing urine before it is eliminated from the body. The other options, such as feelings, names, and naval, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are not related to human anatomy. Additionally, "bladders" is repeated twice in the list of choices, so it is the only logical option to choose.
go to church | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where people go to pray, which is commonly associated with religious practices. Going to church is a common practice among many religious faiths, where people gather to worship and pray together. Kneeling is a common physical posture while praying, but it doesn't answer the question about where people go to pray. Ground and ignorance have no clear connection to the context of the question, and while speaking to God can be done anywhere, the question is specifically asking for a location.
fall out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is considering a wig as a solution to some problem with their hair. The phrase "had begun to" implies that there has been a recent change in the person's hair, and the phrase "up top" suggests that the issue is with the hair on their head. The options "composted," "curl," and "worn free" do not make sense in this context. "Thin out" is a possibility, but doesn't necessarily imply the need for a wig. "Fall out" is the most likely option, as it describes a common hair issue that might prompt someone to consider wearing a wig.
United States | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Colorado's decision to legalize marijuana was significant and groundbreaking in some way. Since Colorado is a state within the United States, the correct answer is "United States." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they are either not part of the United States (Mexico) or not relevant to marijuana legalization (Texas and Arizona).
den | Knowledge: A den is typically a comfortable room in a house that is used for leisure activities such as watching TV, reading, or playing games. Board games are commonly played in dens, as they provide a relaxed and social environment for players. A shelf or cupboard may be used to store board games, but they are not typically played on these surfaces. A shower is not an appropriate place to play board games as it is a wet area designed for personal hygiene. "House" is too general and does not provide any contextual clues relevant to the question.
high street | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man wanted to go shopping but didn't want to be around many people. A high street is a shopping district in a town or city center, often lined with shops and restaurants, but typically less crowded than a shopping mall or busy city area. Canada is a country and not a specific location that the man could have gone to.
own home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog is outside of a warm home with a laughing family inside, which implies that the dog does not have a home or family of its own. Therefore, the correct answer would be "own home." The options "cold room," "suburb," and "nursing home" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Own house" is similar to "own home," but "home" is a more commonly used term for a place where a person or animal lives.
good music | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being discussed enjoys rap music, which may surprise those around them. However, the person justifies their enjoyment of the genre by suggesting that every genre has good music within it. This implies that the person believes that there is no inherently bad genre of music, but rather that it is a matter of personal taste. The answer choice "good music" reflects this reasoning, while the other options are specific genres that do not necessarily relate to the argument being made.
library of congress | Knowledge: The Library of Congress is one of the largest libraries in the world, with over 170 million items in its collection, including books, maps, manuscripts, photographs, and more. It is known for being the largest library in North America and is a symbol of knowledge and discovery. The other options, such as a desk, closet, or classroom, are not large enough to hold a significant collection of books or have any connection to being a library.
station | Knowledge: Police officers typically work out of police stations, which serve as headquarters for law enforcement operations in a given area. While police officers may be present in towns or directing traffic, these are not stereotypical settings for police officers. "Wrong place" is vague and does not provide any helpful information, while "donut shop" is a common stereotype but not necessarily reflective of reality.
test tube | Knowledge: The question implies that the context is relating to storing or collecting more than one drop of blood. A test tube is commonly used in medical settings to hold and preserve samples of blood or other bodily fluids, while the other options - person, human body, battlefield, and doctor - do not seem to be directly related to the idea of storing or collecting blood in a container.
labor in vain | Knowledge: The phrase "never makes much money or status" suggests that the worker has not succeeded in improving their financial or social standing despite their efforts. The phrase "labor in vain" means to work without achieving any meaningful result or benefit, which would be an accurate description of the situation described in the question. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect the worker's lack of progress or success.
exchange information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jack only sees communication as a tool to accomplish something. The phrase "beyond the basics" suggests that he only sees the need to communicate when it is necessary to exchange information. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
save money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman has a specific goal when it comes to shopping - to save money. The phrase "on sale" is a common indicator of discounted or reduced prices, which implies that the woman is looking for ways to save money on her purchases. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the idea of saving money through shopping.
devil | Knowledge: The word "frustrated" implies a negative emotion, and the choices given are all related to religion or mythology. "Devil" is often associated with negative emotions and actions such as anger and frustration, while the other choices are more positive, neutral, or even holy. The meaning of the question is also important in choosing the correct answer, as it specifically asks for a word that someone might shout in a moment of frustration.
living room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the divider referred to is found in a house, where couches and chairs are typically found in a communal area known as the living room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
building | Knowledge: Wood framing is commonly used in construction to create the structure or skeleton of a building. This involves using wooden beams and posts to support the weight of the building and provide a framework for walls, floors, and roofs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
saving money | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person chose to take a bus for their vacation instead of flying, indicating that cost was a significant factor in their decision-making process. This suggests that the person was likely trying to save money, making "saving money" the correct answer. The other options, such as "sitting down" or "making soup," have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
parade | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kid had a specific interest in one particular item among many options, which implies that the item was unique and eye-catching. The choice of the word "parade" suggests that there were many attractive and colorful objects on display. Additionally, toy stores and playgrounds are more common locations for kids to find toys, while a flower shop is unlikely to have a toy balloon available.
to better one's mind | Knowledge: The sentence implies that despite not completing high school, the person enjoyed reading. The phrase "better one's mind" suggests that reading was a way for the person to improve themselves mentally. The other options may be related to the idea of reading, but do not specifically address why the person enjoyed it despite not completing high school.
bathroom | Knowledge: Plumbing refers to the system of pipes and fixtures that bring water into a building and remove waste water. The bathroom is the room in a house where the majority of plumbing fixtures are located, such as sinks, toilets, and showers/bathtubs. While it is possible to have plumbing in a kitchen as well, it is typically a smaller amount and not as complex as the plumbing in a bathroom. Oil refineries and underground locations have no relevance to the context, and while plumbing may be located in walls, this is not the most likely location for it to be found in a house.
old clock | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wooden rod was part of a chime, which is a component commonly found in antique clocks. The fact that the sentence refers to the object as an "antique" further supports the idea that it is referring to a clock. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bad movie | Knowledge: The question suggests that the rubber shark is being portrayed as a villain, which is a common trope in bad movies. Movies often create unrealistic or exaggerated characters to dramatize the plot and create suspense, which may explain why a rubber shark was chosen as a villain. The other options, such as a museum or sea world, do not necessarily have any connection to a rubber shark being portrayed as a villain.
otherwise | Knowledge: The word "tattle" suggests that someone is threatening to reveal or report something. In this context, the person is threatening to do so if they don't get what they want. The word "also" suggests that this person wants something in addition to what they already have or are entitled to. The word "otherwise" indicates a contrast between two possibilities, which fits with the idea of the person wanting something different or else they will tattle. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: Horses are commonly found in fields in rural areas or the countryside where there is plenty of open space for grazing and exercise. Keeping horses in barn stalls or on a race track is not ideal as they need space to move around freely. Fairs are also not a typical place to find horses in fields.
financial center | Knowledge: Banks are typically considered to be financial centers because they handle financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, loans, and investments. The other options do not accurately describe the purpose or function of a bank. "Main street" and "grocery store" describe the location or physical appearance of a building, while "secure place" and "pool of currency" are general descriptions that could apply to many different types of buildings.
physical world | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that feeling a material is a sensory experience that occurs in a physical environment. The options "fabric store" and "attic" may be physical locations, but they do not necessarily imply that the person is in a physical context related to touching materials. "Anything" is too vague and does not provide any context for understanding the sentence. "Science lab" implies an artificial environment rather than a natural, physical one. Therefore, the correct answer is "physical world."
military base | Knowledge: MRE stands for "Meal, Ready-to-Eat" and is a type of food ration used by military personnel in the field. This type of food is not commonly found in fairgrounds, picnics, neighbor's houses, or supermarkets, but is primarily used by the military. Therefore, the correct answer is military base.
college | Knowledge: The question suggests that the library in question is not open to everyone, but rather only to a certain age group. Based on this, the most likely option would be a college library, which typically only allows students and faculty to access its resources. The other options, such as a house, kindergarden, school or downtown, do not fit the criteria of a library that is restricted to a certain age group.
office building | Knowledge: The sentence describes Jill walking to a cubicle, which is typically found in an office building. The other options, such as a house or hotel, do not typically have cubicles. Additionally, the mention of a floor number suggests a multi-level building, which further supports the answer of an office building. The option of a chair is illogical as it does not indicate a location.
solar energy | Knowledge: The question asks for a heat source that can be obtained for free, which eliminates options like gasoline and a car. A bedroom is not a heat source, and fire may not always be free depending on the availability of wood or other fuels. Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of heat that can be harvested using solar panels, making it the correct answer.
airport | Knowledge: In order to travel from Atlanta to Hong Kong, the most common mode of transportation would be by plane, and the departure point would be an airport. The other options, such as a car or skateboard, would not be practical for traveling such a long distance across an ocean. A bus stop or subway may be used to get to the airport, but they are not the primary mode of transportation for the long journey to Hong Kong.
feels good | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the sedative had a positive effect on the patient's pain, which is likely to have caused them to feel better. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely outcome of the sedative, which is to reduce pain and help the patient feel more comfortable. Additionally, the option "immobilize" does not make sense in the context of a sedative for pain relief.
antique store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the speaker is looking for a specific item, an old pie safe with decorative tin. An antique store is a place where one would typically find such an item. The other options, a shopping bag, trash, landfill, and cupboard, do not make sense in this context.
antique store | Knowledge: An icebox built a hundred years ago is considered an antique item, which means it is likely to be sold in an antique store rather than in a regular store or a junkyard. While it is possible that some people may still have an icebox in their homes, it is unlikely that it would be a hundred years old, and it wouldn't be sold in a kitchen or a Walmart.
istanbul | Knowledge: Istanbul is known for its rich history of crafting and selling fine carpets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
grassy field | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the fox movie is important to its reputation or recognition. Foxes are often associated with rural areas and grassy fields, so it makes sense that this type of environment would be a likely setting for a movie featuring a fox. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
club | Knowledge: A disco is a type of nightclub that typically features music for dancing and often includes a dance floor, DJ booth, and bar. Therefore, the most likely answer would be "club," as it reflects the type of establishment that would have a disco. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
bridge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question used a beam to create a temporary structure over a flooded gap. The most logical choice for what he created would be a bridge. The other options, such as warehouse or metal shop, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Shop and new construction are too vague to be the correct choice.
public house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was looking for a bar, which is a type of establishment where alcoholic drinks are served. A public house is another term for a bar or pub, whereas an airport and salon do not typically have bars. Michigan is a state, and a nightclub is not a likely place for James to visit when going to see his sister.
deep ocean | Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in the open ocean, particularly in deeper waters away from shore. The deep ocean provides a suitable environment for many species of sharks, such as the great white, tiger, and hammerhead sharks. Sea World and maritime museums may have sharks on display, but they are generally not found in these environments naturally. Pet stores would not typically carry sharks, and the Great Barrier Reef is a coral reef ecosystem, not a location commonly associated with sharks, although some species can be found there.
conservative | Knowledge: The opposite of progressive is a term that refers to a more traditional or conventional approach, which is often associated with conservatism. The other options are all related to negative or backwards movement, but do not necessarily indicate an opposition to progress.
intelligence or more knowledge | Knowledge: Learning is often associated with gaining more knowledge and becoming more intelligent. Teachers are typically the ones imparting knowledge to students, so it is unlikely that "teacher" is the correct answer. "Dysfunction" does not relate to the purpose of learning, and "know more" is just another way of saying "more knowledge," so both of these options may be eliminated with a little bit of reasoning.
feel ashamed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person has accidentally caused harm to another person, which would likely result in feelings of guilt and shame. None of the other answer choices would make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the consequences of accidentally causing harm to someone else.
new york city | Knowledge: The question refers to a large city on the east coast, which narrows down the options to a handful of choices. The options "jail" and "michigan" are unlikely choices for a question about bars and eateries, and "nightclub" and "restaurant" could refer to many cities. However, "new york city" is known for its vast array of bars and restaurants, making it the most likely answer.
green house | Knowledge: Bees need fresh air to breathe and without it, they may die from suffocation. The only option that contains a structure where air circulation may be limited is the green house. The other options are all outdoor environments where air flow is not typically restricted.
train | Knowledge: Body building is a sport that requires intense physical training and conditioning. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context of the question is "train". This is because preparing to compete in body building involves practicing and perfecting various exercises and techniques to build muscle mass and achieve a defined physique. The other options do not reflect the necessary physical preparation required for body building, such as being "smart" or simply "signing up".
imagination | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question did not intentionally lie, but still had a powerful quality that could have caused confusion or misunderstanding. The word "imagination" would fit this description, as it suggests that the person may have inadvertently created a false narrative or perception of events due to their creative thinking. The other options all describe deliberate acts of deception or concealment, which do not fit the context of the sentence.
suitcase | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer must be something that can hold food. Out of the options given, only a suitcase is commonly used for carrying food, particularly when traveling. The universe, stomach, and stone are obviously not containers for food, and while a box or jar can be used to store food, they are not as commonly associated with it as a suitcase is.
tickets | Knowledge: Going to a play requires a ticket to enter the theater and watch the performance. Without a ticket, one would not be allowed to enter the theater. Patience and time may be required for waiting in line or for the play to start, but they are not necessary to purchase. Having a ticket would make sense grammatically, but it is not a commonly used phrase. A hat also does not have any connection to going to a play.
office building | Knowledge: The term "reception area" typically refers to a space in an office building where visitors can wait to be greeted and receive assistance, including obtaining a key. While a hospital, law firm, gym, and motel may also have reception areas, the context of the sentence suggests that an office building is the most likely location for waiting to obtain a key.
overeating | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that it is important to eat breakfast in the morning but not too much, implying that there is a risk of eating too much in the morning. Overeating refers to the harmful habit of consuming excessive amounts of food, which can lead to indigestion and other health problems. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
work of art | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker was engaged in the act of creating art, and therefore the end product would likely be a work of art. The other options are either outcomes that could result from creating art or subjective experiences that the creator might have while making art, but they are not the actual end product of the creative process. The end product of creating art is usually a tangible object, such as a painting, sculpture, or photograph.
whiskers | Knowledge: The word "tickling" in the sentence suggests a playful or lighthearted interaction. Cats are known for using their whiskers to explore and interact with their environment, which can be playful and ticklish for their human companions. The other options - purring, four paws, four legs, and two eyes - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
parents | Knowledge: The question is asking about something that all people have at first but might not have later in life. The option that fits this criterion is 'parents.' All individuals have parents at birth, but some may lose them due to various reasons such as separation, divorce, or death. The other options such as mentality, feelings, muscles, and brains are not things that people typically lose over time.
meet friend | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the solution to loneliness involves spending time with someone else. Out of the options, "meet friend" is the best choice as it specifically mentions seeing someone who you already consider a friend. "Socialize" and "make friends" are possible ways to alleviate loneliness, but in this context, they are not as direct as meeting up with someone you already know. "Make people laugh" and "get fight" are unlikely solutions to loneliness and are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
catch fish | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is going fishing in the river. One of the main goals of fishing is to catch fish, so this is the most likely answer. The other options, such as buying bait or dropping fish, describe actions that could be related to fishing but do not directly answer the question. And wading in the river could be a way to access better fishing spots, but it doesn't directly answer the question of what you do to the river when you go fishing.
might scare | Knowledge: The word "surprising" suggests that the bill was unexpected or shocking, which could potentially elicit a strong emotional response such as fear or being scared. The options "annoyance," "happy," "humor," and "irritated" do not fit with the context of a surprising bill.
region | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the country being referred to can be described as a "region." A region is a defined area distinguished by geographic, cultural, or political characteristics. The other options, such as continent, America, great outdoors, and forests, are either too broad or too specific to describe "most of the country."
period of recovery | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to get in shape, something is needed in between workouts. This could refer to the fact that the body needs time to rest and recover in order to build muscle and improve fitness. The option "give up" contradicts this idea, while "eat more" may be counterproductive to weight loss goals. "Dance" and "jogging" may be types of workouts, but they do not directly address the need for a period of recovery. Therefore, "period of recovery" is the most appropriate answer.
cooling off | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people enjoy getting wet during the summer season. One possible reason for this is to cool off, as water has a cooling effect on the body. The option "get cold" may be the opposite of what people want during a hot summer day. "Relax" could be a possible reason for getting wet, but it does not necessarily explain why people specifically like getting wet in the summer. "Catching cold" and "catch cold" are essentially the same option and do not make sense in this context as they imply getting sick rather than cooling off.
store | Knowledge: The question implies that the person needs to acquire an eyeglasses case, which suggests they do not currently have one. A store is a logical place to look for an eyeglasses case as it is a commonly sold item in stores that sell eyeglasses or accessories. The other options do not seem to be as relevant in this context, as a factory or bag would not necessarily have an eyeglasses case readily available, a purse may or may not be large enough to hold an eyeglasses case, and a shirt pocket may not be a secure or protective enough option for an eyeglasses case.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence mentions farmland, which is typically found in rural areas rather than urban or suburban locations. Additionally, Mt. Rushmore is a natural landmark that is situated in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, which is predominantly rural and known for its scenic beauty. This indicates that the location being referred to is likely in the countryside. The other options, such as house and farming areas, are too specific and do not provide enough context to make an informed choice.
pick up | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the spy left something at a designated drop location and the handlers were observed doing something in relation to that item. "Pick up" is the correct answer because it suggests that the handlers were retrieving the item left by the spy. "Hold onto" and "carrying" imply that the handlers were already in possession of the item, which does not match the context of the sentence. "Catch" and "picking up" may be possible choices, but "picking up" is a more specific and accurate representation of the action being described.
sour | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sweet has a complementary taste that goes well with another taste. One common pairing is sweet and sour, as found in many dishes like sweet and sour chicken or sweet and sour sauce. The other options do not have a strong association with sweetness in terms of taste pairing. For example, bitter and sweet are often opposite tastes, while salty and dry do not create a pleasing contrast with sweetness.
transmission | Knowledge: The sentence states that noise takes the form of static in a radio, suggesting that the context is related to radio transmissions. The other options do not have any clear connection to radio transmissions or noise in a radio.
make list | Knowledge: The question is asking for a strategy to avoid overspending when making purchases. Making a list of items you need and their prices can help you stay within a budget and not overspend. Paying, spending money, and getting money are not strategies for avoiding overspending. "Have in mind" is too broad and doesn't provide a clear action to take.
comfortable position | Knowledge: Cats are known for their love of sleep, and they often seek out comfortable positions to rest in. This is a common behavior among cats, as they are known to gravitate towards soft, warm spots in order to rest and relax. The other options, such as the floor, residential area, family room, or upside down, are not necessarily related to the context of the sentence, and do not provide any clear indication of how a cat might lay down to sleep.
county fair | Knowledge: The question implies that the cow getting an award is a significant event, which suggests that it is likely taking place at some kind of competition or exhibition. A county fair is a common event where livestock are showcased and judged, so it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as stable, barnyard, sheepfold, and farmyard, are locations where cows may be kept or raised, but they do not have the same association with awards or competitions.
motel | Knowledge: The description of the room suggests that it is a small, self-contained living space with basic amenities, which is commonly found in motels. Schools, hotels, and apartments usually have multiple rooms and may not have a stove or a fridge in the same room as the bed. A friend's house may have a couch and a television, but most likely would not have a stove or a fridge in the same room as the bed.
alley | Knowledge: The word "abandoned" suggests that the garbage cans were left in a hidden or obscure place, rather than in a more obvious location like a driveway, garage, or street. The options "alley" and "own backyard" have a stronger association with places where items might be hidden or left out of sight.
container | Knowledge: The question asks for a suitable place to store leftover soup, which suggests that the correct answer needs to be a container or receptacle of some sort. A toilet mug or supermarket are clearly inappropriate options, and a jar may not be large enough to hold the soup. A cupboard is a possible option, but it does not provide an airtight seal and may not keep the soup fresh for very long. Therefore, a container is the most logical and practical choice.
warehouse | Knowledge: Forklifts are commonly used in warehouses to move heavy loads and stack them onto shelves for storage. The other options do not typically involve the need for a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves. A loading dock may involve the use of a forklift to unload or load trucks, but not necessarily to stack boxes. A construction site and yard may use different types of machinery for heavy lifting, but not typically a forklift. A supermarket would not usually require the use of a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves.
rural area | Knowledge: The word "cottage" suggests a small, cozy dwelling commonly found in rural areas. The phrase "gets flooded often" implies that the area in question is prone to flooding, which is more likely to happen in rural areas with bodies of water nearby, such as rivers or lakes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
victory | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the goal of the battle was to defeat the enemy, which is commonly associated with achieving victory. The other options do not fit with the context of a battle and are not logical goals for soldiers to aim for.
dim | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the view was not clear or bright before changing batteries, which suggests that it was dim. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
early death | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that living life too hard has negative consequences. "Early death" is a logical choice because excessive stress, unhealthy behaviors, and reckless decision-making can all contribute to premature mortality. "Over age," "valuable," "joy," and "happiness" do not fit the context and imply a positive outcome, which is not supported by the sentence.
sping | Knowledge: The word "ping" in the question refers to a message sent from one computer to another to check if the second computer is online and available. A "spam blog" is a blog that has been created solely for the purpose of sending spam messages. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a word that combines "ping" and "spam blog." Of the options given, only "sping" (a combination of "spam" and "ping") fits this description. The other options are not related to spam blogs or online messaging.
purpose | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a difference between simply existing and truly living life, and that having a sense of purpose is important for the latter. Purpose gives direction and meaning to one's actions and choices, and can create a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Acquiring knowledge and happiness may contribute to one's sense of purpose, but they are not necessarily the key to living life. The options "existing" and "joy" do not address the idea of truly living life versus simply existing.
commercial | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the parking lots are associated with stores, which implies a commercial setting. The other options (urban area, business district, airport, amusement park) may have parking lots, but they do not necessarily have stores associated with them.
worthy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student is experiencing a decrease in their sense of self-worth or value due to their failure. The word "no longer" implies that the student previously felt a sense of worth or value, which is associated with the choice "worthy." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
planet earth | Knowledge: Rivers with flowing water are a common feature on planet Earth. While there may be other celestial bodies that feature rivers or similar water formations, the context of the question strongly implies that the answer is related to a planet that humans are familiar with, and Earth is the only option that fits that criteria. The other options are either not planets, or there is no clear connection to flowing water.
hallway or boss's office or large pot | Knowledge: Ficus trees are commonly used as indoor plants in office buildings due to their ability to thrive in low light conditions and their air-purifying qualities. They are often placed in hallways and common areas, as well as in individual offices, including the boss's office. They can be planted in large pots and placed in various locations throughout the building. Tropical zones and regions are not specific to where a ficus tree would be found in an office building.
fabric store | Knowledge: The context of the question is related to buying materials for a specific item, which is a pillow. A fabric store typically sells various types of fabrics, including those suitable for pillow-making, such as cotton, linen, and silk. The other options, such as construction, toy store, and factory, are not commonly associated with selling fabrics for crafts or home decor. House is also not a viable option as it is an improper noun and does not refer to a specific store or shop.
anxious | Knowledge: The sentence contrasts Jason's calm exterior with the fact that he has recently experienced losses, implying that he is now experiencing some negative emotions. "Anxious" is the most likely option because it suggests a sense of worry or unease, which would be a natural response to experiencing losses. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "frustrated" and "flustered" suggest a sense of agitation rather than calmness, "excited" suggests a positive emotion rather than a negative one, and "calmness" is the opposite of what is being described in the sentence.
apartment complex | Knowledge: Balconies are a common feature of residential buildings such as apartments and condos, as they provide outdoor space and an additional living area. The other options listed do not have a clear connection to the presence of balcony railings, and may instead have other distinguishing features, such as ornate decorations in theaters or high-end amenities in hotels.
stand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something is being wrecked during car chases in movies, and that thing is specifically referred to as a "stand". The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. It is important to pay attention to specific keywords and context clues in order to choose the correct answer.
make mistakes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going the wrong way leads to some negative consequences. Out of the given choices, "make mistakes" is the most fitting in this context. Going the wrong way is usually associated with choosing the incorrect path, making errors or taking decisions that may not be beneficial, which all involve making mistakes. The other options such as schizophrenia or ridiculous do not seem relevant to the given context.
jamb | Knowledge: A door jamb is the vertical part of a door frame into which a hinged door fits. If the jamb is moved, it can affect the movement of the door. The other options are not directly related to the function of a door or its frame.
playful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker had a preconceived notion about the personality of elephants, but was surprised to find that the younger ones were playful. The word "playful" means that the elephants were lively, active, and enjoyed having fun. This characteristic is often associated with young animals, including elephants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
golf course | Knowledge: The question implies that the runway being referred to involves shoes that would be considered unusual or unorthodox, even for drag queens. Given the options provided, a golf course would be the most likely place for such shoes to be worn, as golf shoes tend to be designed for function rather than fashion, and would likely look out of place in other contexts such as a military base or a fashion show. The other options have no apparent connection to the idea of shoes that are unconventional.
herb garden | Knowledge: Bees are attracted to flowers for their nectar and pollen, which they use as food. Herb gardens often contain a variety of flowering plants, such as lavender and thyme, which are particularly attractive to bees. The other choices, including the sky, story book, great outdoors, and picnic, do not have a direct connection to the food sources of bees.
criminal charges and/or going to jail | Knowledge: Obstructing justice is a criminal offense that involves knowingly interfering with the legal process, such as tampering with evidence, lying to investigators, or intimidating witnesses. As such, the consequences typically involve criminal charges and the possibility of imprisonment. The other options are not accurate descriptions of the potential outcomes.
office supply store | Knowledge: The items listed (copy paper, pens, and desks) are commonly associated with office supplies, suggesting that an office supply store would be the most likely location to purchase them. The other options, such as a supermarket or artist's studio, do not specialize in office supplies and therefore would not be the most obvious choice.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to education, and specifically to young people learning. A classroom is a common location for such an activity, especially if the subject matter is related to computers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
None of the above - this question presents a common misconception as there are actually many negative consequences associated with drinking alcohol, including but not limited to impaired judgment, liver damage, increased risk of certain cancers, and addiction. It is important to educate oneself on the potential risks and make informed decisions about alcohol consumption.
find truth | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person wants to satisfy their curiosity, which can only be achieved by finding answers or the truth to their questions. The other options, such as seeing a particular program, going to the market, attending school or eating pizza, do not necessarily address the person's curiosity directly. They may provide temporary pleasure or entertainment, but they do not offer a satisfactory solution to one's curiosity.
ground | Knowledge: Dust is commonly found on the ground and can be easily stirred up and made visible in sunlight. It is less likely to be visible in a restaurant or library, as these spaces are usually well-maintained and cleaned regularly. A windowsill may collect dust but it is usually in small amounts and may not be very visible in sunlight. Carpet can also collect dust, but it may not be visible in sunlight if it is a darker color or if the carpet fibers are dense.
lower | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James physically moved or adjusted the stairs in some way to make them higher. To accommodate John's request to get up as well, James would have had to lower the stairs. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Costa Rica | Knowledge: The use of the name "San Jose" suggests a location within Costa Rica, which is a well-known place for diversity in wildlife, including lizards. Captivity and encyclopedia are unlikely locations for a lizard, while New Mexico and imagination land do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
antique store | Knowledge: Opera glasses are typically associated with traditional or classical music events, such as operas, and are often used by individuals who want to get a closer view of the performers on stage. Given that the question is asking for old opera glasses, it's reasonable to assume that they may be looking for a vintage or antique pair. Antique stores often sell old and unique items, including rare or vintage opera glasses. The other options do not seem likely to offer old opera glasses.
plastic holder | Knowledge: The question is asking for a better alternative to a paper clip for holding together paperwork in a hospital desk drawer, implying that the paper clip may not be the most reliable or efficient option. The other choices do not necessarily serve this purpose better than a paper clip. A file folder is useful for organizing papers, but it does not hold them together in a confined space. A staple can easily damage important documents and is not conducive to organizing or adjusting the papers. A desk drawer is not a solution for holding papers together. The keyword "hospital" may indicate a need to avoid metal objects for safety reasons, making a plastic holder the most suitable option.
ill | Knowledge: The phrase "under the weather" is commonly used as a euphemism for feeling sick or unwell. Therefore, the correct answer would be the choice that is associated with feeling sick, which is "ill." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
no legs | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason fish cannot walk on land is because they do not have a specific body part. Legs are necessary for walking on most surfaces, and fish lack this appendage. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for why fish cannot walk.
have food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason why John can't eat lunch is that he does not have any food available to him at the moment. The other options - getting, preparing, buying, or needing food - may all be potential reasons why John can't eat lunch, but the sentence specifically states that he doesn't have any food currently.
trained | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dogs need something in order to behave appropriately. The word "trained" is commonly associated with teaching dogs acceptable behaviors and commands. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
roof | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bird was flying before it got tired and needed to land. Out of all the options, roof is the most likely place for a bird to land after flying, as it is a high point and provides a good vantage point for the bird to rest and observe its surroundings. The other options, such as cage, sky, or on the head of a man, are less likely to be the answer because they don't fit the logical progression of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The term "superhighway" typically refers to a major highway or freeway that connects different areas within a city. Therefore, the most logical answer would be "city". The other options, such as rural areas, cyberspace, computer networks, and industrialized countries, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
dude ranch | Knowledge: A pack horse is a horse that is trained to carry loads on its back, typically used in outdoor environments such as mountains, forests, and ranches. Among the given choices, only "dude ranch" is associated with outdoor activities involving horses. Belmont Park and race track are associated with horse racing, while women's literature and a movie have no clear association with pack horses.
basketball team | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the captain is going to an arena, which suggests that they are part of a team that plays in a sports competition. The options battleship, airplane cabin, and military do not involve sports, so they can be eliminated. The option soldier could be a possibility, but the context of the sentence does not mention anything about war, combat or the military, which rules out that option as well. Therefore, the correct answer is basketball team.
farmer's field | Knowledge: Wheat is a type of crop that is typically grown in open fields, particularly in rural areas where agriculture is common. The other choices, such as bread or mill, are more related to the processing and consumption of wheat rather than its cultivation. Forests are not typical places for growing crops and are better known for their trees and wildlife, so the correct answer is farmer's field.
city | Knowledge: Cities are well-known for having multiple office buildings, as they are usually the center of business and commerce. Industrial complexes may also have office buildings, but the context of the sentence is not related to industry specifically. Work refers to any location where someone may be employed, so it could be any of the options given. New York is a specific city but not all cities are like New York. Suburbia is the opposite of a city and typically has fewer large office buildings.
illness | Knowledge: The other options do not seem to be an immediate cause to stop driving. Traffic jams may cause delays, but not necessarily a complete stop. Wheels turning and tire wear are normal parts of driving and are not an emergency situation. Lack of fuel is also not an immediate cause to stop driving, as the driver may be able to make it to a gas station. Illness, however, can cause someone to immediately stop driving if they suddenly become incapacitated or unable to operate the vehicle safely.
side of head | Knowledge: The question refers to a body part, specifically the ear, which is located on the side of the head. The other options do not have any relevance to the question and can be eliminated as incorrect answers.
help | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's job is to serve customers, which implies that their primary responsibility is to assist customers with whatever they need. The word "help" directly corresponds to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options (such as "come back" or "pay to") do not make any sense in the context of serving customers. "Smile" may be a part of providing good customer service, but it is not the main responsibility of the person mentioned in the sentence. "Money" implies a transactional relationship, which again doesn't fit with the idea of serving customers.
slender | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opposite of being "thick" is being something else. From the choices, only "slender" is a common antonym for "thick," meaning thin or slim. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gain knowledge | Knowledge: Attending a lecture is a common way for students to acquire knowledge on a specific subject. The fact that the student is attending a lecture on engineering suggests that they are interested in learning about this field of study and hope to gain knowledge from the lecture. The other options, such as becoming smarter or going to sleep, do not fit the context of attending a lecture on a specific subject.
stairwell | Knowledge: Fire extinguishers are typically placed in areas where fires are more likely to occur, such as kitchens, workshops, or mechanical rooms. In a building with no windows, it is important to have a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergencies. A stairwell is a common location for fire extinguishers because it is a central location and easy to access from different parts of the building. The other options do not make much sense in the context of the question.
spare room | Knowledge: The question implies that the sofabed is not a permanent fixture in the room and is only used for guests, suggesting that it is located in a room specifically designated for visitors. The options sitting room, living room, and dining room are typically used by the residents of the house, making them less suitable for a guest sleeping arrangement, while a basement is not necessarily a common area for guests. A spare room is often set up specifically for guests and may include a variety of sleeping arrangements, including a sofabed.
yellow pages | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the old lady preferred to search for the restaurant's information using a particular method, which the granddaughter was trying to challenge with her smartphone. The phrase "yellow pages" refers to a directory that lists businesses and their contact information, which was commonly used before the widespread adoption of digital technologies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mandatory | Knowledge: The question is asking for a word that describes something that is not optional and must be done. "Mandatory" is the best choice as it means something that is required by law or rule and cannot be avoided. "Obligatory," "required," and "compulsory" all have similar meanings to "mandatory" and have a similar connotation of something that is necessary. "Selective," on the other hand, means being very careful in your choice and does not fit the context of the question.
go somewhere | Knowledge: The question is asking what you need to do if you don't work from home, implying that you need to go somewhere to start work. The other options do not relate to the context of the question. Walking in the rain, sleeping at night, resting, and riding a bus are not actions that specifically relate to starting work or leaving your home.
urban area | Knowledge: The word "rapid" suggests that the question is asking about a place where construction is happening quickly or on a large scale. Urban areas are typically known for having high population densities and high demand for new buildings, which can drive rapid construction. The other options do not have any clear association with rapid building.
moving | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Dan is doing something to make the car do something, and the word "accelerator" suggests that he is trying to speed up. Therefore, the correct answer is "moving." The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence, or they are the opposite of what is being described (e.g. "slow down").
maine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the churchyard is significant because it is the furthest east in all the contiguous states. Of the given options, Maine is the state furthest east and is therefore the most likely answer. The other options, such as "near the ocean" or "countryside", could apply to many different states and do not provide a clear indication of the specific location of the churchyard.
practice | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking for a legitimate and ethical way to improve one's chances of winning in a competition. Cheating and sabotage are unethical and would not result in a genuine victory. Fairness is a basic expectation but does not provide any useful tips for winning. "In competition" is not a specific action that one can take to improve their chances of winning. Practicing, on the other hand, is a well-known way to improve one's skills and increase their chances of success in a competition.
teeth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the treats the dog enjoyed were beneficial to some aspect of his health. The context implies that the treats were not simply for pleasure, but for a specific purpose. The options "two eyes," "four legs," and "two ears" are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense in relation to the sentence. The option "one mouth" is not specific enough and does not provide any clear indication of why the treats were beneficial. The best answer is "teeth," as treats can be used to clean a dog's teeth and promote good oral health.
indeterminate | Knowledge: The word "foreign" suggests that the characters being used are not typically used in the language or alphabet of the reader. Therefore, it may be difficult or impossible for the reader to interpret the meaning of the typing, making the paper's content indeterminate or uncertain. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hear news | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the ladies at the salon are interested in finding out about something, and that they are eager to hear news whenever someone new arrives. This suggests that they are looking for updates on current events, gossip, or other developments that may be of interest to them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or suggest a desire to learn about something new.
apparatus | Knowledge: The word "intricate" suggests that the machine had many complex and detailed components. The term "apparatus" is often used to describe a complex set of mechanical or electronic equipment, which fits with the idea of an intricate machine. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
competent | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the thing being described is not likely to be considered bad by anyone. The options "profitable," "beneficial," and "valued" all have positive connotations and therefore don't fit the description. "Excellent" could also be seen as positive, but could potentially also have negative connotations depending on the context. "Competent," however, is a neutral or even slightly positive term that is unlikely to be considered bad by anyone.
apartment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to lives in New York City and has a bathroom that they use frequently. Based on common living situations in New York City, it is likely that the person lives in an apartment, which is the most common type of housing in the city. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the idea of a personal bathroom for someone living in New York City.
reduced | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady was trying to reduce her intake of sweets and snacks, which typically contain high amounts of sugar and calories. As a result, it can be inferred that her weight would likely decrease if she continued to eat less of these types of foods. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - defecating is a bodily function, becoming full is a temporary sensation, and gaining weight goes against the goal of the lady trying to eat less sweets and snacks.
church | Knowledge: The context suggests that the committee meets regularly after something specific. Given the options, church seems like the most likely answer as many committees and organizations meet after church services on a Sunday. The other options are not typically associated with meetings for committees or organizations.
furniture | Knowledge: Linoleum is a type of flooring material that is often used in high-traffic areas such as kitchens and living rooms. However, the question specifically asks what you would put on the surface covered with linoleum, which suggests that the answer should be something placed on top of the linoleum. Furniture is a common item that is placed on flooring surfaces, regardless of the material. The other options are not necessarily associated with being placed on top of a flooring surface.
farmyard | Knowledge: The sentence mentions cows enjoying sunshine and solitude by a barn, which suggests that they are on a farm. The option "countryside" also suggests this, as farms are often located in rural areas. The other options, such as "fairgrounds" and "on the moon," have no connection to the context of the sentence and can be disregarded. "Give birth to dogs" is also an absurd option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
shopping mall | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the barbershop is located within a larger structure that houses multiple stores. Shopping malls often have multiple stores under one roof, making them a likely place to find a barbershop that is not in a separate building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker has been traveling and needs to unload their luggage, which is something typically done at a hotel. Hotels are places where travelers can stay and store their luggage while they explore the area. Train stations, ship decks, and bus depots may have luggage storage facilities, but they are not typically the first places people think of when looking to unload their luggage. A bus stop usually doesn't have any storage facilities at all.
mit | Knowledge: MIT is a university that is widely known for its focus on science, engineering, and technology. As such, it is likely that a student who is interested in computers may attend MIT in order to pursue their studies in this field. The other options do not have any clear connection to computer science or technology.
city apartment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe chose to rent a type of living space called a loft. A loft is typically a large, open space in a city building that was originally used for a commercial or industrial purpose and has been converted into living quarters. Soho is a neighborhood in New York City known for its artsy loft apartments, but it is not a type of living space. A hunting lodge is a rustic, rural accommodation for hunters, and a frame house is a type of traditional suburban or rural dwelling. Room and board usually refers to a type of short-term accommodation, such as a hotel or guesthouse.
It is impossible to choose a correct answer for this question as none of the choices can be inferred from the given sentence. Additionally, the options "death and destruction" and "flew out" are particularly inappropriate and insensitive as they suggest extremely negative and potentially harmful outcomes. It is important to avoid using inappropriate or offensive language in questions and answers.
feeling comfortable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that turning up the thermostat has made the person feel warmer, which is a common goal when adjusting the temperature. Feeling comfortable is the most likely outcome of making this change. Overheating and starting a fire are unlikely consequences of simply increasing the thermostat in a bedroom, while an increase in temperature and pleasure are not necessarily related to the context of the sentence.
eat breakfast | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people typically engage in a morning activity with their family, and the choices reflect different possible options. However, the word "stereotypically" suggests that there may be some cultural or social expectations surrounding this activity. Eating breakfast is a common family activity in many cultures, and it is often seen as a time for sharing and bonding. The other options may not be as popular or widely practiced in the context of the sentence.
back up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the little cameras in the car made something easier, and the context of the sentence implies that it has to do with driving or parking. "Back up" is the only option that directly relates to driving and parking, as having cameras in the back of a car can make it easier to see and navigate when reversing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lamb | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when you go to buy a sheep, you will learn something specific about it. The clue is in the word "sheep" itself, which usually refers to an adult female or male sheep. However, the choices suggest that the sentence may be referring to something else. The word "lamb" is the most likely answer, as it refers to a young sheep, and is often purchased for its meat. The other options, such as "wool" and "goat", do not necessarily apply to the context of buying a sheep.
downtown | Knowledge: Shopping malls are typically located in busy, urban areas where there is a high concentration of people and a large amount of foot traffic. Downtown areas are known for having many shopping options and commercial developments, so it is likely that a popular shopping mall would be located there. The other options do not have the same level of commercial development or population density as downtown areas, making them less likely locations for a popular shopping mall.
library | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wound is not urgent, so it is not necessary to go to an emergency room or hospital. A library is not a typical place to go for medical attention, but it may be where someone goes to research or learn more about how to treat their non-urgent wound. The other options are related to getting medical attention, which is not necessary in this case.
fight enemy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that soldiers undergo a significant amount of training, which presumably prepares them for a specific task. The phrase "fight for freedom" seems like a plausible choice, but the sentence does not indicate that this is the purpose of the training. Instead, it suggests that the training is intended to prepare soldiers to engage in combat with an opponent, which makes "fight enemy" the correct choice. The other options, such as following orders or instructions, may be part of a soldier's training, but they do not capture the main purpose of the training that is mentioned in the sentence.
orchestra | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John enjoys playing a specific instrument (a brass drum) and has an interest in classical music. Orchestras typically play classical music compositions and often include brass drum instruments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well - "low notes" could refer to any instrument, "rock band" is unrelated to classical music, "sing" does not involve playing an instrument, and "drum set" is not specific enough to match the description of a brass drum.
trouble | Knowledge: The word "corrupt" implies unethical and dishonest behavior, which can lead to negative consequences such as instability, unrest, and social unrest. In the context of a government, corruption often involves bribery, nepotism and misallocation of resources, which can lead to economic decline and exacerbate inequalities, among other things. The term "civilization" implies a more positive outcome, and the other options do not fit with the negative connotations of corruption.
pretty smart | Knowledge: The use of tools is often considered an indicator of intelligence in animals, as it requires problem-solving abilities and the ability to understand cause and effect. The other options may be characteristics of birds, but they do not specifically relate to the use of tools.
table | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John cleaned the place where food is served last, which implies that he likely cleaned the table. Shelves and libraries are not typically places where food is served, and the fridge and refrigerator are not mentioned as being dirty or in need of cleaning.
gardener | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was responsible for maintaining the rose bushes in his yard, which requires knowledge and skill in gardening. The word "talented" also implies that James was skilled in this area. The other options do not fit as well with the sentence; while "backyard" and "beautiful garden" relate to the setting, they do not describe James's skills, and "plants" and "kew gardens" are too general and specific, respectively.
feelings of guilt | Knowledge: The question suggests that killing people may have an effect on one of the victims. It is known that guilt is a common emotion experienced by individuals after committing a violent act or crime against others. The other options do not have a direct connection with the concept of killing people making one of the victims do something.
feel cold | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to a season, winter, which is commonly associated with lower temperatures and colder weather. People typically feel cold during the winter because of the changes in temperature, and this is reflected in the sentence. The other options, such as using money or becoming old, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
nod and smile | Knowledge: The question asks for a nonverbal way to show agreement with someone without getting close or speaking, so options like standing with them or shaking hands wouldn't be appropriate. Nodding alone or shaking hands alone aren't enough without a verbal affirmation, and shaking hands may not be appropriate in all situations. Nodding and smiling together is a common nonverbal cue that indicates agreement, and is often used in situations where the other person is speaking, such as during a meeting or conversation.
house | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common practice of where to put a book after purchasing it, which is usually in your own personal space for reading and storage like a house or apartment. The other options such as discount store, ground, university, and antique store are not places where books are typically stored after purchase.
farmer's market | Knowledge: Farmer's markets are well-known for selling fresh produce directly from the grower. This means that lettuce can be purchased directly from the person who grew it, allowing for a fresher and more direct connection between the consumer and the producer. Supermarkets and grocery stores typically sell produce that has been transported from larger farms to a central distribution center, and then to the store. Salad refers to a dish made from lettuce and other ingredients, and a refrigerator is an appliance used to store food, not a place to buy it.
trouble | Knowledge: The question asks what giving assistance can avoid, implying that it can prevent something negative from happening. The option "trouble" makes sense in this context, as offering help can prevent someone from experiencing difficulties or problems. The other options, such as "feeling good" or "helpfulness," do not have a clear connection to avoiding negative outcomes.
harbor or port | Knowledge: If a vessel is taking in water, it suggests that it is experiencing some kind of problem or emergency situation. In this context, it is likely that the vessel needs to go to a location where it can be repaired or fixed. Both harbor and port are locations where vessels can go to receive repairs or assistance, making them the most likely options. Deeper and ocean do not offer any solutions to the problem of a vessel taking in water, while human body is completely unrelated to the context.
wilderness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that marmots are captured from their natural habitat. The most logical option among the choices would be wilderness, which could refer to any area where marmots are found in their natural habitat. The other options, such as Switzerland, Spain, Vancouver Island, and Australia, do not have any clear connection to marmot habitats.
airport | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is waiting for a ride, which is likely to be transportation-related. The option "airport" stands out because it is a common place for people to wait for rides and is often associated with the stress of making a flight. The option "bathroom" seems like the most logical choice given the context, but the sentence specifically states that Jane is not in the bathroom.
jail | Knowledge: A jail is a place where people are typically sent as a form of punishment and confinement, so it's reasonable to assume that a human would not want to be there. The other options (church, school, house, park) do not inherently carry negative connotations, and humans may even enjoy spending time in those places.
try to win | Knowledge: The word "games" usually implies some level of competition or goal-oriented activity. To "play" a game usually means to engage in an activity with the intention of achieving a specific outcome or objective, such as winning. While some games can also be educational or focused on creativity (e.g. "learning" or "dancing" games), the majority of games involve trying to beat one's opponents or achieve a high score. Therefore, "try to win" is the most appropriate answer to this question.
find truth | Knowledge: The term "nerd" often implies a strong interest in academic pursuits, and a desire for knowledge and understanding. Therefore, of the given choices, "find truth" would be the most likely activity that a nerd would have a curiosity for, as it aligns with their intellectual and analytical interests. The other options are less closely associated with intellectual pursuits and do not necessarily require a curiosity to do.
kitchen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that even though the living room was arranged for the party, people tended to gather elsewhere while the mother worked. The kitchen is a common area for gathering during parties, as people often enjoy congregating around food and drinks. The other options, wireroom, ocean, hallway, and outside, do not have any clear connection to party dynamics or household living arrangements.
dance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy and Marge were a couple who enjoyed spending time together, but were not interested in a serious relationship or being intimate. The option "dance" is the most appropriate answer as it is an activity that two people can enjoy together in a non-romantic way. The other options imply a more serious or intimate relationship between the two, which is not suggested in the sentence.
surrender | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the player recognized that they were going to lose the game and therefore chose to give up or surrender rather than continuing to play. The phrase "game over" also implies that the game had ended, further supporting the idea that surrender was the appropriate choice. The other options, such as working harder or defending, do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest the player was still trying to win.
pirate ship | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the vessel mentioned is associated with criminals and cannons. Pirate ships are typically associated with both of these things, as pirates were known for raiding and pillaging other vessels, and cannons were a key tool in their arsenal. The other options do not have any clear connection to both criminals and cannons in the context of the sentence.
dorm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John plays chess with his roommate between classes, which implies that they are likely in college or university. The most logical place to have a chess set in a college or university setting would be the dorm room, as this is where John and his roommate likely spend most of their time and where they would have easy access to their own chess set. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
raise children | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people being referred to have a responsibility related to creating or bringing up other people. "Raise children" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to the creation of new people and involves a significant responsibility. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
breathing hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fat man had only run a short distance and was already experiencing some form of difficulty. The option "breathing hard" is the most likely answer as it is common for individuals who are not used to running to experience shortness of breath when they begin to exercise. The other options are not likely as they do not relate to the physical exertion that the man was experiencing.
comfort | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that staying in bed on a cold morning brings warmth, which suggests a feeling of comfort. Resting and comfort are related, but the use of the word "warm" indicates that "comfort" may be a more appropriate choice. "Stubborn" and "bed sores" are not related to the context, and "missing out" is not relevant to the sentence's meaning.
question authority | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the term being sought describes a situation where people do not trust their leaders. "Question authority" is a phrase commonly used to encourage individuals to challenge the actions and decisions of those in positions of power. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
punishment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is hurting another person, which is a crime. The police are responsible for enforcing laws and arresting individuals who break them. Punishment is a common consequence for committing a crime, so it is the most likely choice. Anger, sadness, and suffering may be emotions felt by the victim or witnesses, but they do not necessarily represent what the police will do.
Seychelles | Knowledge: Crabs are commonly found in coastal regions and in water bodies like oceans, seas, and rivers. The options "fish market," "underpants," and "fishing boat" do not seem like suitable habitats for a crab to live in. Maine is a coastal US state, and while it is possible for crabs to live there, it is not specific enough for the question. Seychelles, however, is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean known for their beaches and marine life, including various species of crabs.
death | Knowledge: While getting drunk and experiencing a hangover are common side effects of drinking alcohol, death is a severe and uncommon side effect. Alcohol poisoning, accidents while under the influence, and long-term damage to organs can all be potential causes of death related to alcohol consumption. Frequent urination is a common side effect as alcohol acts as a diuretic, but it is not considered a severe side effect.
atmosphere | Knowledge: The question is asking about the path the astronauts would have to take to get to the moon, suggesting that they would need to go through certain elements in order to reach their destination. The correct answer is atmosphere because before reaching outer space, the astronauts would first have to travel through the Earth's atmosphere. Night sky, universe, and air are not elements that the astronauts would have to pass through to reach the moon, while outer space is the destination rather than an element that needs to be traveled through.
being ahead | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the leading team had become complacent and stopped actively trying to maintain their advantage because they had grown too comfortable. The phrase "being ahead" directly relates to the idea of the team being in the lead, and it makes sense that they would become complacent when they feel secure in their position. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
auditorium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event was a musical performance or concert, which typically takes place in an auditorium or theatre. The other options, such as building or airplane, do not typically host musical events or concerts. Show is too general to be a specific location for a concert in this context, so auditorium is the most fitting choice.
identification | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was waiting in line at the airport and finally got to the ticket checker. The person then got out their billfold, which typically includes identification and other important documents. The context of the sentence suggests that the person is showing their ticket and identification to the ticket checker. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
complimentary | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was wearing new clothes and looked good, indicating that his wife might have praised him or given him a positive compliment. The word "complimentary" means expressing admiration or approval, which fits well in the given context. The other options do not make sense in the context or contradict it.
synagogue or church | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place where people of the same faith gather, which suggests a religious context. Synagogues are places of worship for Jewish people, while churches are places of worship for Christians. Conferences and car shows do not have a religious connection, and Montana is a state and not a specific place of religious gathering.
pick | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who aspire to play guitar often use a specific item made of plastic. The term "chew on" suggests that this item is small and often held in the mouth, and "pick" is a commonly-used item for people who play guitar to pluck the strings of the instrument. The other options do not have any clear connection to playing the guitar.
mandatory | Knowledge: The word "not optional" implies that there is a requirement or obligation to do something. The words "mandatory," "obligatory," and "compulsory" all indicate that something is required or mandated. "Nonelective" could also be a correct answer as it means something that cannot be chosen or opted out of, but it is less commonly used in everyday language. "Lazy" is not related to the question and is a distractor answer.
expiration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the living person is close to death, which means that they will soon "expire" or pass away. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone who is dying. "Massage" and "perspiration" suggest physical activity, which is unlikely for someone who is at the end of their life. "Interaction" does not make sense in this context and "respiration" suggests breathing, which may not be relevant for someone who is dying.
get up early | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to go to sleep sooner than normal, which implies they want to wake up earlier than usual. The phrase "get up early" is the only option that directly relates to the goal of waking up earlier. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the context of the sentence.
income tax | Knowledge: The question implies that there is some sort of payment or deduction that needs to be made when someone is receiving payment. In most countries, people are required by law to pay a portion of their income as taxes to the government. This is known as income tax. The other options are not directly related to the context of the question, and don't make sense as a response.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jenny was at a location where it was not appropriate for her to answer the phone. Since she was just visiting, it is likely that she was at a friend's house or someone else's residence where she was not expected to answer the phone. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not suggest a location where answering the phone might not be appropriate for someone who is just visiting.
live many years | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat had a second chance at life after being nursed back to health by the nice lady. Therefore, it is likely that the cat will have the opportunity to live for many years. The other options do not correlate with the context of the sentence - "dog" is a different kind of animal, "see king" and "sun itself" do not make sense as actions for a cat, and "meow" is what cats usually do.
talk about themselves | Knowledge: Narcissists are known for their excessive self-love and self-absorption. One of the common behaviors associated with narcissism is that they tend to dominate conversations and make them all about themselves. They often have a compulsive need to talk about their accomplishments, experiences, and achievements, and tend to ignore or belittle others' contributions. The other options do not align with the commonly observed traits of narcissistic individuals.
sincere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bad person does not place value on honesty and acting without pretense. The word "sincere" means genuine or truthful, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options may have some connection to morality or character traits, but they do not directly address the concept of honesty or pretense.
library | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a place where you can access maps that are not available for purchase. The most likely location for such maps would be a library, which commonly stocks maps and other resources that are not widely available to the public. The other options, such as a cabinet or guide drivers, do not provide access to maps that cannot be bought, while maps that can't be bought are unlikely to be found in bookstores or on the internet.
high mountains | Knowledge: Marmots are known to be mountain-dwelling animals, living in high-altitude areas such as the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, and the Himalayas. The other options like yellow pages, jungle, woods, and hiding place do not connote any specific habitat that marmots are known to live in.
cross roads | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Emma's condition was not improving despite James' attempts to cheer her up with the cats. The phrase "come to something" implies that a turning point had been reached, and Emma may have sensed that her illness had become more serious. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get money | Knowledge: Taxes are a form of revenue for governments, allowing them to fund public services and infrastructure. Therefore, one of the primary reasons for imposing taxes is to acquire money to support the functioning of the government and its various departments. The other options do not align with the general purpose of taxes and have a negative connotation that is not associated with taxes.
plant kingdom | Knowledge: The sentence states that Ficus belongs to the family Moraceae which is a part of a much broader spectrum. Moraceae is a family of flowering plants and Ficus belongs to this family. Therefore, the broader spectrum in this context is the plant kingdom, which includes all types of plants ranging from algae to mosses to flowering plants. The other options such as science class, garden, flowerpot, and arboretum are not related to the context of the sentence.
farts | Knowledge: High fiber foods are known to cause an increase in gas production in the digestive system, which can result in flatulence or passing gas. This is a common side effect of eating high fiber foods and is often considered an unpleasant sound or experience. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
zoo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is interested in seeing a big cat, which is a type of wild animal generally not commonly found in residential areas or barns. The most likely place to find a big cat would be a zoo, which exhibits wild animals for people to observe. The other options do not have any clear connection to the topic of finding a big cat to see.
mountain range | Knowledge: A mountain range is a geological feature made up of a series of mountains, which are typically made mostly of rock. The other options do not fit the definition of a geological feature made mostly of rock. The countryside refers to a rural area with varying terrain, ground is a general term for the surface of the earth, a street is a man-made thoroughfare, and a bridge is a structure that spans a gap.
in bed | Knowledge: The word "relax" suggests that the gentleman is looking for a comfortable and peaceful place to unwind. While a club or meeting may be social, they are not typically associated with relaxation. A meditation center or church may offer a peaceful environment, but they may not be accessible or desirable for everyone. In contrast, being in bed is a common and comfortable place for relaxation and is therefore the most likely answer.
waving thumb in air | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to hitchhike to their destination since their car won't start, and the most common gesture used while hitchhiking is waving one's thumb in the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desktop | Knowledge: The question specifically asks for a type of computer that is not a laptop, meaning it must have the capabilities of a computer but not be portable. The only option listed that fits this description is a desktop, which is a computer that is designed to be used on a desk rather than being carried around. The other options, such as a library or a table, are not computers at all, and the mention of a space shuttle or microwave oven is meant to be misleading and irrelevant to the question.
forest | Knowledge: The word "thick" suggests a dense and abundant growth of trees. While trees can be found in all of the locations listed in the choices, a forest is typically known for having a high density of trees. Orchards are typically more structured and less dense, while state parks and countryside areas may have a mix of trees and open spaces. Jungles are also known for having dense vegetation, but they are typically found in tropical regions and may not be the most likely answer based on the options provided.
garage | Knowledge: A ladder is a typically used for home maintenance or construction projects, and thus, it is commonly stored in a place where such work is done. A garage is a perfect option as it provides a secure and covered space for storing tools and equipment. The other options, such as an apple orchard or a hardware store, do not make sense as places to store a ladder.
give away | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the clothes were still in good condition, so it wouldn't make sense to burn or throw them away. "Get rid" and "throw out" are also possibilities, but "give away" is a more positive option and often associated with charity or community giving. Therefore, it is the most likely answer.
better day | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating breakfast can help improve someone's day if they have been feeling stuck in a routine and busy. Eating breakfast provides energy to start the day and can help boost mood and productivity. The other options, such as dirty dishes, bad breath, and gas, do not relate to the idea of improving one's day.
leash | Knowledge: Dogs are typically taken outside using a leash, which allows the owner to control and guide the dog while out of the house. The other options (front door, porch, table, toilet) do not facilitate taking the dog outside for a walk or to do its business, and may even be unsafe or inappropriate for the dog's needs.
bedroom | Knowledge: The question is asking about a location in which to place a rug for functional purposes, specifically to keep feet warm at night. The most appropriate answer is "bedroom," as it is the room in which one typically sleeps and where keeping feet warm would be most beneficial. The other choices, such as "table" and "ceiling," do not make sense in the context of the question. "Persia" may be a reference to where the rug was made, but it does not provide any information about where to place it for warmth.
inform | Knowledge: A newspaper is known for providing readers with information about current events, news, and other relevant topics. It is a source of information that is intended to educate and inform readers about what is happening in the world around them. While newspapers may also communicate and announce various announcements or events, their primary purpose is to provide information and news to their readers. "Motivate" and "elongate" do not relate to the primary purpose of a newspaper.
keep score | Knowledge: Keeping score is a common method of determining who wins when playing games. It involves tracking each player's points, goals, or achievements throughout the game and then comparing them at the end to see who has the highest score. Learning how to play the game and trying to win are important steps in playing games, but they do not necessarily determine who wins. Fun is subjective and varies from person to person, and requiring time to be kept may be a rule of some games, but it does not necessarily determine the outcome of the game.
heading north | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the car is traveling from a southern state (Florida) to a northern state (Ohio), which means it is traveling towards the north. The correct answer is "heading north." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence as there is no indication of a rollover, flying, or speeding up.
great barrier reef | Knowledge: The Great Barrier Reef is a famous location in Australia known for its diverse marine life, including sharks. The deep ocean and Pacific Ocean are too vast and general to determine a specific location for seeing a shark. The maritime museum and aquarium may have exhibits on sharks, but they are not natural locations to observe living sharks.
cloud judgment | Knowledge: The sentence implies that easy-to-get sex can impair one's judgment, suggesting that the easiest sex to get "clouds" one's ability to make good decisions. This is a common expression used to describe how certain actions or substances can impair one's clarity of thought. The other options do not relate to this context and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
rainforest | Knowledge: The fact that the tree had thousands of animals living in it suggests that it was located in a habitat with a rich and diverse animal population. The rainforest is a well-known location that fits this description, as it contains a wide variety of species that depend on the trees for food and shelter. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where the tree might be located.
air | Knowledge: Oxygen is a component of the air we breathe. The other options (sky, earth, space shuttle, water) do not contain oxygen in a form that is readily accessible to humans. While the sky and space may contain oxygen in trace amounts, they do not provide a sufficient supply for human consumption. Earth and water do not contain oxygen in a breathable form, and if anything, they may contain harmful contaminants that could be detrimental to human health.
fun | Knowledge: The question is asking about the effect of watching something entertaining on people. The word "entertaining" suggests that the activity is enjoyable and fun, which means that the answer should also reflect this sentiment. The other options, such as "hospitality" and "intelligence," do not have a clear connection to the context of the question and do not make sense as a result. Therefore, the correct answer is "fun."
anger | Knowledge: The phrase "on tilt" refers to being emotionally frustrated or upset while playing poker, which can lead to making poor decisions and losing more hands. The fact that the person is losing hand after hand further emphasizes their frustration, which is often associated with anger. None of the other options suggest a negative emotional state or a correlation with losing in a game.
runway head can be found at a fashion show. | Knowledge: A runway is a long, narrow strip used for planes to take off and land at an airport or military base. However, in the context of the question, the term "runway head" is likely referring to the beginning of a fashion runway where models begin their walk. This is a common term in the fashion industry, and the other options do not make sense in this context.
circus | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that acrobats are performing somewhere and may need a launching platform for their act. The most logical answer would be a circus, as acrobats are commonly associated with circus performances and are known to use various props and platforms to enhance their performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to acrobatics or launching platforms.
catch on fire | Knowledge: When an airplane hits the ground, it often experiences a high amount of force and impact, which can cause it to catch on fire due to the ignition of fuel or electrical systems. While the other options may apply to airplanes in different situations, such as accelerating during takeoff or carrying freight during a cargo flight, they do not accurately describe the result of a plane crashing to the ground.
egg | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dilemma involves a choice between a chicken and something else related to it. The most common association between chicken and another option is probably eggs, which are often produced by chickens. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lake or river | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is likely near a body of water where they can throw a coin. This would typically be a lake or river, as these are common locations where people can engage in activities like fishing, boating, or picnicking by the shore. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a person throwing a coin into the water.
buy food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person does not have raw ingredients, which typically means they do not have the necessary components to prepare a meal from scratch. The options "cook food" and "prepare food" imply that the person has ingredients, which is not the case in this situation. "Buy food" is the most logical choice since it allows the person to purchase ready-to-eat or pre-made meals without needing raw ingredients, while "have food" is too vague and does not provide a clear solution to the problem.
register | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a process that new students have to go through in order to start attending school. The most common process for this is registration, where the student provides information about themselves to the school's administration. The other options, like being old enough or putting on shoes, are not related to the process of starting school.
tail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lizards have the ability to regrow a body part if it is cut off, which is a characteristic commonly associated with their tails. Lizards are known for their unique ability to regenerate their tails as a means of self-defense and survival. The other options do not have any clear connection to this characteristic of lizards.
then have | Knowledge: The phrase "If you get something" suggests that the statement is referring to acquiring or receiving something. The phrase "you'll then have it" is a common expression meaning that you will possess or own the item in question. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
arlington | Knowledge: The use of the word "graveyard" suggests that the location is specifically used for burying the dead. With the exception of "on the ocean," all of the other choices could have graveyards, but "arlington" is well-known for having a very large graveyard - Arlington National Cemetery. This is a significant landmark in the United States that is commonly associated with military burials and honors. The other options lack this same level of specificity and significance.
copy | Knowledge: The word "reproduction" in the question suggests that the answer is something that is made to resemble or imitate an original document. The word "copy" is the most commonly used term to refer to a duplicated version of an original document, whereas the other choices have more specific meanings. "Remake" suggests something that has been remade or redone from an original, "mimeograph" is a specific type of printing machine, and "derivative" implies that something has come from or is based on an original source but is not an exact reproduction.
feel lucky | Knowledge: The question asks for a person's immediate reaction to winning the lottery. The phrase "immediate reaction" implies that the person's response would be instantaneous, and the phrase "winning the lottery" suggests that the person would be experiencing a positive outcome. Therefore, the correct answer would be "feel lucky" as this is the most logical and expected response to winning the lottery. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
pain | Knowledge: The use of the word "small" in the question indicates that the falling episode may not have been severe enough to result in broken bones or serious injury. However, falling can often result in pain, even if it's just a minor discomfort. The option "getting hurt contact with" is not grammatically correct, and "going down" is a vague option that does not specify the outcome of the falling episode.
card room | Knowledge: Poker is a type of card game commonly played in designated areas known as card rooms. These spaces are often found in casinos or other gambling establishments and are specifically designed for playing poker. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and placing a poker table in the middle of the road or at a neighbor's house would not be practical or appropriate.
healthy living | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cleaning what you eat leads to some positive outcome. Cleaning what you eat likely refers to washing fruits and vegetables before consumption, which is a common practice to remove dirt, pesticides, and bacteria. A clean diet is considered an essential aspect of healthy living as it reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses and promotes good digestion. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Canada | Knowledge: Beavers are an iconic animal of Canada and are even depicted on the Canadian nickel. Ontario is a province in Canada known for its vast forests and waterways, making it a perfect habitat for beavers. Woodlands and rivers are also habitats where beavers can be found, but they are not specific enough to choose as the answer. The zoo is not a country or a habitat where beavers are typically found in the wild.
race track | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that horses with jockeys are likely to be found engaged in some sort of racing activity. The word "jockey" typically refers to someone who rides horses professionally or in a competitive context, which makes the race track the most logical answer. The other options (magazines, countryside, fair, kept in barn stalls) do not have any clear connection to horse racing.
meeting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a notepad can be useful for keeping track of agenda items during a particular type of event. While a notepad can be used in many different situations, the word "agenda" is key here, as it suggests that the event in question is likely a meeting of some sort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bus stop | Knowledge: Since the person doesn't have a car, the most likely mode of transportation would be using public transportation, such as a bus. A bus stop would be the best option for the person to get to their destination. The other options are unlikely to provide the transportation needed to get somewhere without a car.
going away | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam had left and his sister was still angry about it. The phrase "planning to return" implies that he had gone away and was planning to come back. The other options do not relate to leaving and returning, making "going away" the only appropriate choice.
prehistoric times | Knowledge: Mammoths are extinct animals that lived during the prehistoric era, which is the period of time before written history. They are often studied by scientists, and their fossils are displayed at museums of natural history. While "ancient times" is a vague description and could technically refer to any time in the past, "prehistoric times" is a specific and accurate answer to the question.
drink | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group sat down on stools with the intention of ordering something. This is often associated with restaurants or bars, where customers order drinks while sitting on stools. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "fart" is an inappropriate choice.
get sick | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exposure to a virus has a negative effect on people, as it is asking what happens when they are exposed. Getting sick is a commonly associated consequence of exposure to a virus, as viruses can cause illness and disease. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this context.
stupid |  | Knowledge: The word "foolishly" suggests that the people in question are behaving in a way that lacks good judgment or common sense. The terms "strange," "kind," and "weird" do not necessarily connote a lack of intelligence or judgment, and therefore would not be fitting descriptors. "Dumb" is a possibility but carries more of a connotation of a lack of understanding or knowledge, while "stupid" more specifically connotes a lack of good judgment.
warm up | Knowledge: The context suggests that John set aside the gun because it wasn't helpful in his current situation, which is implied to involve being in a cold environment. The sentence also states that he needed to build a fire, which would be useful for keeping warm. Therefore, the correct answer is "warm up". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
peace | Knowledge: The phrase "if everyone is loving another" suggests a scenario where there is universal love and harmony between individuals. In such a scenario, it is reasonable to assume that there would be an absence of conflict or violence, leading to peace. The other options- marriage, satisfaction, heartache, and happiness- do not necessarily follow from the given scenario.
Feet | Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of "hands." Hands and feet are commonly recognized as pairs of body parts that are located at opposite ends of the body, so it makes sense that "feet" would be the opposite of "hands." Toes, legs, and even "body part" are not necessarily opposite to hands, as they do not refer specifically to paired body parts located on opposite ends of the body.
cartilage | Knowledge: Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints and acts as a cushion between bones. It is also found in various other parts of the body, such as the nose, ears, and spinal column. Muscle and flesh are soft tissues that cover and attach to bones but do not specifically cover them. Skin covers the outermost layer of the body but does not directly cover bones. Matter is a more generic term that could potentially refer to anything in the body, but does not specifically relate to bone covering.
atlas | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can be used to plan a driving route to the Pacific Ocean. An atlas is a book of maps that can help in this process. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question. Drawings may not provide enough detail for a driving route, San Francisco Bay is just one location and not relevant to a general route to the Pacific Ocean, West is too general, and the Southern Hemisphere is not relevant to driving to the Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere.
music store | Knowledge: A music store is a common place to buy musical instruments, including pianos. Music schools and concert halls may have pianos available for purchase, but they are not typically known for selling instruments. A neighbor's house would not be a legitimate option for purchasing a piano, and a symphony orchestra drawing room is not a common location for instrument sales.
feel full | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a sizable lunch has a specific result. "Feeling full" is the most appropriate answer since it is a common sensation associated with eating a sizeable meal. The other choices are either unrelated or have negative associations (e.g. giving up, obesity) that do not fit with the context of the sentence.
movie theater | Knowledge: Popcorn is a common snack that is often associated with movie theaters, where it is a popular option for moviegoers. While popcorn can be found in other public places, such as at sporting events like soccer games, the context suggests that the most likely place to find popcorn in this scenario is at a movie theater. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The question is asking where olives can be stored to keep them fresh. The choice "jar" could work, but it is not clear if the jar needs to be stored in a specific place. "Pressed for their oil" is not relevant to storing olives. "Ice box" is an outdated term for a refrigerator, so it could work. "Pizza" is not a storage option. "Refrigerator" is the clearest choice as it specifically refers to a place where food can be stored to keep it fresh.
spread wings | Knowledge: Birds typically leave their nest by spreading their wings and flying away. This is a natural and instinctive behavior for most bird species. Singing songs and laying eggs are not related to leaving the nest, while falling down is a potential but unlikely way for a bird to leave the nest. Reproduction is also not related to leaving the nest as it is a separate process that occurs before the young birds hatch and learn to fly.
chair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being seated all day is associated with an office job. Therefore, the correct answer must be something that is related to comfort while sitting. A chair would be the most likely option for providing comfort in this scenario. The other options are not related to sitting nor are they likely to provide comfort for long periods of time.
spending money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had an addiction to the act of shopping and not to actually owning or using the products. This implies that the person was mainly after the experience of spending money rather than the satisfaction of owning or using the products. Option "interacting" doesn't fit the context of the sentence. Option "bankruptcy" is the consequence of excessive spending, not the motive. Option "agony" is unrelated and doesn't make sense. Option "owning" is the opposite of what is suggested by the sentence.
buy things | Knowledge: Going to the market typically involves shopping for goods such as produce, meats, or crafts. The other options such as meeting new people or eating samples could also be potential results but are not guaranteed. Tedium would only be a result if the person finds shopping boring and bankruptcy is a drastic outcome that is not necessarily linked to going to the market.
cool off | Knowledge: The question implies that someone is looking to find relief from the heat, even if they are unable to swim or have allergies. "Cool off" is the most logical option because it offers a solution to beating the heat without requiring swimming or causing an allergic reaction. "Dive", "buy beer", and "wear shorts" are all unlikely solutions or may even exacerbate the problem, and while "eat ice cream" may provide temporary relief, it is not the most effective or practical solution for cooling off.
shore line | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the crab is on land and needs to cross something to reach the ocean. Out of the given options, the shore line is the most likely answer as it refers to the boundary between land and sea. The other options (lakes, shallow waters, tidepools, and the Atlantic ocean) do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not require a crossing from land or are not relevant to the location being described.
nausea | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting drunk is not a desirable experience for everyone, and lists the potential negative outcome of getting drunk as a clue to the answer. Some people experience nausea or vomiting when they consume too much alcohol, making it an unpleasant experience for them. The other options are not commonly associated with the negative effects of drinking too much alcohol, except for death which is a more extreme and rare outcome.
eat first | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is more hungry than thirsty, so it would be best for them to eat before drinking. Eating would provide nourishment and help satisfy their hunger, while drinking alone may not be sufficient. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
wisconsin | Knowledge: Bald eagles are a symbol of America, and they are often found near bodies of water where they can hunt fish. Wisconsin has many lakes and rivers where bald eagles nest and hunt. Wisconsin is also known for its dairy industry and cheese production, making it a likely choice for the second part of the question. The other options do not have a clear association with bald eagles or cheese.
debt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending too much time buying products can lead to negative consequences related to money. Debt is a common consequence of overspending or spending more than one can afford. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
safe bet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a secure and reliable investment. The term "underdog" often refers to someone or something with lower chances of success. Therefore, it would not make sense that this person would invest their money there. On the other hand, a "safe bet" is a secure and reliable investment, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
submarine  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the torpedo was fired from an unseen location, which is a common tactic used by submarines in naval warfare. Submarines are known for their stealth capabilities and ability to attack other ships while remaining hidden underwater. The other options, such as patrol boats or frigates, do not have the same level of stealth and are less likely to be able to launch an unseen attack with a torpedo.
names | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characteristic being referred to is used to distinguish humans from each other, which rules out options like ears and bladders that all humans have. Feelings are a subjective experience and cannot be used to identify individuals, while naval is an anatomical feature that is not unique to each person. Names, on the other hand, are given to individuals as identifiers and are unique to each person, making them the correct answer.
slurred speech | Knowledge: Alcohol affects the central nervous system, including the areas of the brain that control speech and coordination. Slurred speech is a common side effect of drinking too much, as the tongue and lips become less coordinated and precise in their movements. Pass out, forgetfulness, and stumbling may also occur, but they are not specifically related to the ability to speak. Death is a severe but rare consequence of alcohol consumption, and it does not typically manifest as an inability to talk to others.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the traveler is looking for a place to stay, which would typically be a hotel or motel. The options "in a palace" and "Mexico" are too specific and do not apply to all locations. "Every country" is also too broad and unlikely to be true. "Town" is a logical option as hotels are commonly found in urban areas, particularly in town centers where there are many shops and restaurants. "Motel" is also a logical option as they are specifically designed for travelers who need a place to stay on a budget.
plate | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the green beans are being prepared for consumption, which means they would likely be placed on a plate before being eaten. The other options, such as the bathroom or container, do not make sense in this context. The farmer's market may be where the green beans were purchased, but it is not directly connected to the act of eating them. The mouth is where the beans end up, not where they are found before eating.
reckless | Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the timid friend with the trouble the others got into, suggesting that their behavior was opposite to hers. The word "reckless" means acting without thinking about the consequences, which would be a direct contrast to the timid behavior of the friend. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence as they do not suggest an opposite behavior to being timid.
disagreeable | Knowledge: The word "amiable" suggests that the solution they arrived at was friendly and pleasant, but the word "problem" suggests that there was some difficulty or challenge that needed to be resolved. The word "disagreeable" acknowledges that the problem was not easy or straightforward, but the solution was still reached in a friendly and agreeable manner. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not relate to the problem or suggest a negative outcome.
make noise | Knowledge: Going to a concert typically involves listening to music, dancing, and enjoying the performance of the artist on stage. This usually involves cheering, clapping, and making noise to show appreciation and excitement for the music. Making time, payments, hay, or peace do not have any relevance to the context of a concert.
bar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to drink alcohol and unwind after a difficult day. Bars are commonly associated with serving alcoholic beverages, making it the most likely option. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Furthermore, a graveyard or cemetery would not be an appropriate location to drink alcohol.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that fresh baked cookies are a common occurrence at Grandma's place, which is likely to be her house. The other options (fridge, jar, plate, pantry) are unlikely, as they do not necessarily indicate a place where fresh baked cookies are found. A fridge implies a refrigerated space, jars and plates are storage vessels, and a pantry is usually a room for storing non-perishable food items.
working hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had been unemployed for a long time and finally had an interview for a job opportunity. It is likely that the person would feel relieved and motivated to work hard in order to secure the job. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect a positive outcome of the interview. Nausea, rejection, frustration, and stress are all negative emotions that the person might feel if the interview did not go well.
living room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the rug is a place where many people walk and eat popcorn, which is commonly associated with a living room. Living rooms are often the central gathering place in a home where people relax, socialize, and watch TV, making it likely that the rug would see a lot of foot traffic and have popcorn scattered about. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
parking meter | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a specific location where a coin can be placed in order to prevent a car from being towed. A parking meter is a likely choice because it is common for drivers to pay for parking with coins inserted into the meter. The other options, such as a piggy bank, wishing well, change purse, or slot machine, have no connection to the context of the question and do not provide any indication of a place to put a coin to prevent a car from being towed.
getting arrested | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are consequences for expressing oneself without pants in public, which is likely to be a violation of indecent exposure laws. "Getting arrested" is the most likely outcome in this scenario. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
kooky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the behavior of the kids is not considered ordinary or normal by others. The word "kooky" is often used to describe people or behavior that is eccentric or unconventional. The phrase "to them" indicates that the kids themselves view their behavior as perfectly acceptable, which reinforces the idea that their behavior is not typical. The other options imply that their behavior is unremarkable or conformist, which contradicts the meaning of the sentence.
jewelry store | Knowledge: The context suggests that the drawstring bag contains valuable stones, and it would make sense for valuable stones to be purchased or acquired from a jewelry store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
department store | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the gift in question was popular and common, which suggests that it would be widely available in a commercial setting rather than a personal space like a closet. Additionally, the mention of heading somewhere suggests that the person is looking for a specific location or type of store, and a department store is a common location for purchasing gifts due to its wide range of products. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as a christmas tree and stocking are not places to buy gifts, and a specialty store may not carry a widely popular gift item.
feeling of fullness | Knowledge: When someone eats a big dinner and stops eating because they feel satisfied, they are likely experiencing a feeling of fullness. This occurs when the stomach stretches to accommodate the food and sends signals to the brain that it is time to stop eating. The other options, such as weight gain, nausea, and upset stomach, are unlikely to be associated with a feeling of pleasantness or satisfaction after a meal. "Not hungry" is also not the best option since it does not describe a pleasant sensation, but rather a lack of appetite.
cleanliness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, so the answer must be related to the concept of housework. The option "boredom" does not make sense as something that impresses someone, while "chores" is too general and does not differentiate the teen's actions from regular housework. "Allergies" and "pain and suffering" are negative experiences that the girlfriend is unlikely to be impressed by. Therefore, the most logical answer is "cleanliness," which is the outcome of doing housework and could be seen as a positive trait in a partner.
cafeteria | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the person is at school, which suggests that they may have access to a cafeteria or dining hall. The other options (home, under the cow) are not relevant to the context of being at school. The option "menu" may be helpful in finding out if milk is available in the cafeteria, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question. "Accompaniment to meal" is also not specific enough, as there may be other options besides milk that are served with meals.
embarrassment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James's lies were not convincing and that he was laughed at, indicating that he was embarrassed by the situation. The other options imply legal consequences, which are not mentioned in the sentence. Perjury is a crime that can result in indictment, penalty, or jail time, but the sentence does not provide any evidence that James faced any of these consequences.
stars | Knowledge: The Milky Way is a galaxy, a huge collection of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is stars as they are the main component of the Milky Way. The other options such as candy or a refrigerator are not related to the context of the question and can be eliminated as incorrect answers.
north of south carolina | Knowledge: The question asks for the location of North Carolina, so the answer will provide a specific location rather than a general category like "United States" or "Carolina." The phrase "north of South Carolina" provides a clear geographic location and suggests that North Carolina is located above (or north of) its southern neighbor. The option "south" is incorrect because it does not provide a specific location and could refer to any number of places. The option "south of Virginia" is incorrect because it places North Carolina in the wrong position relative to another state.
base | Knowledge: The question is asking for the body part that a head is attached to. The word "attached" suggests a physical connection, which implies that the head is anchored or supported by something else. The term "base" is commonly used to refer to the part of an object that serves as its foundation or support, such as the base of a statue or the base of a lamp. The other options (home, subordinate, foot, point) do not make logical sense in the context of the question.
airport | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking where someone might stop at a gift shop while checking out, which implies that they are leaving a location. Among the choices given, the airport is the most likely option for someone to be leaving from, as they would be checking out of their flight or returning home after a trip. The other options (hotel, Disneyland, train station, museum) do not necessarily involve leaving a location, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
you'll learn | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the teacher was frustrated because the student gave an incorrect answer. The teacher then offered advice to the student by telling them to "just listen." This strongly suggests that the correct answer is related to learning through listening. The phrase "you'll learn" fits this context perfectly, as it conveys the idea that by paying attention and listening carefully, the student will be able to learn and improve. The other options do not make sense in this context, and are not related to the idea of learning through listening.
lighting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was installing something overhead, which is likely to be lights. The context also mentions thunder and lightning, which further supports that the correct answer is "lighting." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laugh at her | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Erin was not successful in being entertaining, which may imply that she was not particularly funny or charismatic. Therefore, she may have wanted people to laugh at her in order to feel validated and appreciated. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get money | Knowledge: Cashing in your chips at a casino usually means that you have won money. Therefore, the casino owner would feel satisfied that you have contributed to their profits by gambling and ultimately losing money. The option "leave" is irrelevant because it does not demonstrate any emotional response from the casino owner. The options "betrayal," "resentment," and "revenge" imply negative feelings towards the player, which are not likely to occur if the player brought in a profit for the casino.
public office | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mascot of a weasel is associated with someone or something that is untrustworthy or sneaky. Public office is a common target of criticism and distrust, so it would be a likely place for someone to assign the weasel mascot. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
concert | Knowledge: A contralto is a type of singing voice, specifically the lowest female singing voice type. The context of the sentence suggests that attending an event where a contralto is being enjoyed would likely be a musical performance or concert, rather than a more casual gathering like a fun or choir practice. The options "describe singing voice" and "chorus" are partially correct, as they both relate to singing, but do not specifically indicate an event or performance.
web | Knowledge: Spiders are known for creating webs in various locations to catch their prey, and this is a characteristic commonly associated with spiders. Basements and cellars may be dark and damp environments where other animals may live, but spiders typically do not live in these spaces. Trees and mailboxes are not typical habitats for spiders, although some species may make their homes in trees.
sentence | Knowledge: A sentence is a string of words that contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. It is considered the basic unit of communication in written and spoken language. A proper noun is a specific name for a person, place, or thing, which can be used as the subject in a sentence. The other options do not accurately describe the structure of a sentence. A phrase is a group of words that does not contain a subject and verb, while a dictionary is a reference book that contains definitions of words. English and language are too broad and general to accurately describe the specific structure of a sentence.
in cinema | Knowledge: The use of "seat" and "vibrates" suggest that the question is referring to a specific type of seat found in a specific location. Seats that vibrate are often associated with movie theaters or cinemas that offer 4D or immersive movie experiences. The other options do not typically have seats that vibrate, making "in cinema" the most likely answer.
thesaurus | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for something beyond just a definition, which could be found in a thesaurus. A thesaurus provides synonyms and related words to the one being looked up, which can help in expanding one's vocabulary and understanding of a word. The other options like a novel, encyclopedia, or see work do not necessarily aid in providing alternate words or expanding one's vocabulary. "Determine word's definition" is redundant as the person was already using a dictionary for that purpose.
sweating | Knowledge: When you wear too many clothes while hiking, your body may become overheated and start to sweat excessively. This can lead to discomfort, dehydration, and even heat exhaustion or heat stroke in extreme cases. The other options do not have a logical connection to the context of the question.
Switzerland | Knowledge: Marmots are commonly found in the Alps, which are located in Switzerland as well as some neighboring countries. The other choices do not have a strong connection to the habitat of marmots. American forest and North America are too broad and do not specify a particular region where marmots may be found. Northern climates may include areas where marmots live, but the term is too general. New Zealand, on the other hand, is too far from the natural habitat of marmots.
library | Knowledge: The question is asking where someone can borrow magazines, which suggests a location where magazines are available for loan. Libraries are well-known for offering a wide variety of reading materials, including magazines, for borrowing. Bookstores and friends do not typically offer borrowing services, while tables and doctors are not commonly associated with magazine borrowing.
hangover | Knowledge: The phrase "hitting the bottle" is a colloquialism for drinking alcohol excessively. The consequences of drinking too much alcohol the night before can result in a hangover, which is characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, and dehydration. While some of the other options may be associated with drinking, such as alcoholism or drunkenness, only hangover specifically refers to the effects of consuming alcohol.
new insights | Knowledge: The sentence suggests James is seeking a deeper understanding or knowledge of something through contemplation. "New insights" seems the most fitting choice as it implies a fresh understanding or perspective gained through reflection. "Revelations" and "enlightenment" imply a more profound experience, while "hesitation" and "lessons" do not seem to align with the sentence's context.
gravity | Knowledge: The force that keeps objects on the surface of the earth is gravity. Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects, in this case, the earth and any objects on its surface. Tectonic plates are responsible for the movement of the earth's crust, the sun and one moon are celestial bodies that orbit the earth, and the four seasons are caused by the earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun. None of these options are related to the force that keeps objects on the surface of the earth.
airport | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the doorways in question are designed for vehicles to drive through, which is a common feature of airport entrances. Airports often have drop-off areas or valet parking where vehicles can pull up directly to the entrance to unload passengers and luggage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
locker room | Knowledge: Athletes typically prepare for games in locker rooms, where they can change into their uniforms, review game plans, receive medical treatments, and mentally prepare for the competition. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
backpack | Knowledge: The word "between periods of instruction" suggests that the context of this question pertains to a school setting. Binders are typically used to organize class materials, and it is common for students to carry them in backpacks between classes. The other options, such as a car, office supply store or bookcase, are not relevant to the context of the question. The classroom may be a possible option, but it is not specific enough to indicate where the binder should be kept between periods of instruction.
workers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that even though there is a lot of automation in factories, the essential aspect of it is still related to human workers. The heart and soul of a factory refers to the human element that is responsible for creativity, innovation, and problem solving. The other options do not fit in the sentence's context and do not relate to the idea of human input that is essential for factories.
skin damage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that bathing five times a day had negative consequences for Lilly's health or wellbeing. Bathing frequently can strip the skin of its natural oils and moisture, leading to dryness and irritation. Over time, this can cause damage to the skin, making it more vulnerable to external factors like sun damage and pollution. Cleanliness is not an issue in this sentence since bathing is already being mentioned, and nudity or tension to ease are not relevant either.
farm | Knowledge: Apple trees are commonly found on farms, as they are a common crop grown for commercial purposes. The other options do not suggest any connection to apple trees.
yard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lazy man did not enjoy having to maintain a certain aspect of the house, which is likely to be related to outdoor maintenance. The option 'yard' is the most logical choice, as it requires regular upkeep such as mowing the lawn, trimming bushes, and watering plants. The other options do not require regular outdoor maintenance and are less likely to be the correct answer.
shock | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a preconceived notion or assumption about something, but discovering the truth was unexpected and surprising, leading to a feeling of shock. The other options do not fit with the idea of being surprised or caught off guard by something.
greedy | Knowledge: The word "want" suggests a desire for something, and in this context, it specifically refers to money. The word "selfish" implies a focus on personal gain without regard for others, which may or may not be related to the desire for money. "Weird" and "ridiculous" are both subjective judgments that do not necessarily relate to wanting money. "Hungry" typically refers to a physical need for food rather than a desire for money. "Greedy" specifically refers to a strong desire for more money or material possessions than one needs or deserves, making it the most appropriate choice.
embarrassment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's comments made the speaker feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. The use of the word "sloppy" implies that the man was criticizing the speaker's behavior, and asking these questions in front of others suggests that the criticism was public. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely emotional response to this scenario.
advance knowledge to understanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person started reading to gain a deeper understanding of a subject. Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that pertains to gaining knowledge or understanding. "Advance knowledge to understanding" is the most fitting choice as it directly relates to gaining a deeper understanding. The other options relate to different aspects of education or other concepts unrelated to the acquisition of knowledge.
air | Knowledge: Confetti is typically thrown into the air during celebrations or events, where it will float and scatter before falling to the ground. This makes "air" the most logical choice among the options provided. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
with someone | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is feeling isolated and lonely on campus, indicating a desire for social connection. The phrase "with someone" directly addresses that desire for companionship. The other options do not directly address the need for companionship and may even exacerbate feelings of isolation (e.g. "confined").
conference | Knowledge: A conference is a gathering of professionals or experts in a particular field or industry. It is a place where people can connect, network and share ideas with others in the same profession. The other options, such as a theater, a supermarket, a town, or a cinema, do not offer the same opportunities to meet and connect with people in the same profession.
research laboratory | Knowledge: White mice are commonly used in research laboratories as they are easily bred and have a high reproductive rate. They are often used for experiments related to genetics, behavior, and disease research. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the typical habitat or use of white mice.
church | Knowledge: The mention of men in robes suggests a religious setting, which is further supported by the option "church." Wine and crackers are commonly served during religious ceremonies such as communion, making church the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bottom out | Knowledge: When a car hits a curb at high speed, it can cause the wheels to hit the curb and then come down forcefully, which is known as "bottoming out." This can cause damage to the underside of the car and may also affect the alignment of the wheels. Rolling over is also a possibility if the car hits the curb at a certain angle or speed, but it is less likely based on the wording of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
airport | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location where one would read magazines while waiting for winged transportation is a place where people board flights. The only choice that is related to transportation and features flights is the airport. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
front door | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the lock was used as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to the school. The most likely place for a lock in this context would be at the front entrance, which is the main access point for the school. The other options do not make sense in the context of a school and are unlikely places for a lock to be used.
inappropriate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's behavior was not appropriate for the situation. It mentions that he laughed during a funeral, which is typically a somber occasion. The other options do not match the context of the sentence.
drenching | Knowledge: The word "submerges" suggests that the clothing is being fully immersed in water, which would likely result in the clothing becoming thoroughly wet or "drenched." The other options do not accurately describe what would happen to clothing when submerged in water.
san francisco bay | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location being referred to is a port city on the west coast of the U.S. where ships from the Pacific Ocean unload their cargo. San Francisco Bay is a well-known port in California, situated on the west coast of the U.S. and known for its large-scale commercial operations, shipping, and maritime industries. The other options, such as northwest, southern hemisphere, west, and atlas, do not fit the specific criteria set forth in the sentence.
cellar | Knowledge: Potatoes need to be stored in a cool, dark and dry place to prevent sprouting and rotting. A cellar is a common storage place for potatoes as it provides the right conditions for long-term preservation. The other options such as countryside, sliced, restaurant, and fried are not relevant to the storage of potatoes for the winter.
strip club | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human had a desire for something sexual in nature, which is often associated with strip clubs as they feature exotic dancers. The other options, such as the space shuttle or international space station, have no clear connection to fulfilling lustful needs. The church is typically associated with suppressing such desires, so it would be an unlikely choice. "Anywhere on earth" is too general and does not provide any specific context to make a knowledgeable choice.
kitchen | Knowledge: A card catalog is a tool used for organizing and locating materials in libraries or other information resource centers. Therefore, options such as book store and library are likely to use a card catalog. On the other hand, a store might use a digital catalogue, but a card catalog is less likely. The kitchen has no relevance to information or resources, making it an unlikely location to use a card catalog.
higher intelligence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after studying, the person came to the conclusion that there was something more than just man's brain at work. The phrase "made sense" indicates that a logical conclusion was reached. The option "higher intelligence" fits well as it suggests something beyond the normal intelligence of a human being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
machine parts | Knowledge: A mechanic is someone who works with machines, particularly in repairing and maintaining them. The options "washing a car" and "servicing airplane" are specific tasks that may be performed by a mechanic, but they do not encompass the full scope of their work. "Oil engine" suggests a specific type of machine, while "machine tool" refers to a specific category of machines used in manufacturing processes. "Machine parts" is the most general option that encompasses the types of machines a mechanic would be likely to work with.
study history | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student is interested in learning about past events. "Study history" is a specific and direct answer that addresses this question, while the other options do not provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand. "Pass course," "better grade," "complete test," "ask questions," and "answer question" are all related to completing a course or an assignment, but none of them indicate a desire to learn about past events specifically.
anxiety | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that meeting new people can be a nerve-wracking experience, which is commonly associated with feelings of anxiety or nervousness. While some people may feel excited about the prospect of making new friends, the question specifies "most people," so this option is less likely to be the correct answer. "Being bored" and "love" are not associated with meeting new people, so they can be eliminated as well. "Happy" is also not the best fit in this scenario, as meeting new people can be a stressful experience for many individuals.
bad feelings | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is experiencing remorse or a sense of guilt about their actions, which is commonly associated with feeling bad. Deception and schizophrenia have no clear connection to remorse or regret, while living in poverty and indigestion are unlikely to be related to the person's emotional state.
go off | Knowledge: The phrase "throwing fruit" suggests that the argument may have turned into a physical altercation, which could have made the situation even more intense or heated. The phrase "go off" is often used to describe a situation that escalates or becomes chaotic, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hang out at bar | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a way to relieve stress with friends, and hanging out at a bar with friends is a common activity that can help to relieve stress. Socializing with friends has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health and can provide a sense of support, which can be helpful in managing stress. Running may also be a stress-relieving activity, but it is not specifically related to being with friends. Drinking alcohol may initially relieve stress, but can ultimately make the problem worse in the long run. Cleaning the house and dreaming are not social activities that involve being with friends.
rural countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that small unpaved lanes can be found somewhere, and the options given provide different locations where they might be found. A city is unlikely to have many small unpaved lanes, as most streets in a city are paved. A bowling alley is an indoor location and has nothing to do with small unpaved lanes. Highways are large and often paved, so they are not likely to have small unpaved lanes either. Estonia is a country and not a location where small unpaved lanes might be found. Therefore, the correct answer is rural countryside, as small unpaved lanes are a common feature of rural areas.
talk too much | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason why the teacher yelled at her students is related to their talking behavior. Talking too much in class is commonly considered as disruptive and can negatively impact other students' learning. Therefore, it's likely that the teacher scolded her students for not following the classroom rules or for distracting others with their talking. The other options, such as answering questions, teaching children or opening boxes, do not seem to be valid reasons for the teacher's outburst.
downtown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the author is looking for the best Japanese restaurant, and based on this, we can infer that the restaurant is likely to be located in an area with a high concentration of Japanese culture and cuisine. Downtown areas of major cities often have districts or neighborhoods that are known for their diverse cuisine, including Japanese cuisine. The other options do not specify any particular area known for Japanese cuisine and culture.
death | Knowledge: The sentence describes John's worry about the potential risks of football, specifically mentioning his fear of the consequences of his sport. The fact that the concussion was less scary than something else suggests that the other option must be even more severe or dangerous. Out of the remaining choices, death is the most severe outcome and the one that would likely cause the most fear and concern. The other options do not convey the same sense of severity or potential danger.
listening | Knowledge: The question implies that effective communication between two people requires a specific action or skill. While opening one's mouth and having a voice are necessary for speaking, they are not sufficient for effective communication as one can talk without being listened to or understood. A translator may help two people from different language backgrounds communicate, but it is not a requirement for effective communication between two people who share the same language. Therefore, the answer must be listening, which involves actively paying attention to what the other person is saying and responding appropriately.
losing money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that buying beer at the store will have a negative impact on your wealth, which implies that it will cost you money to make the purchase. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: relaxation and pleasure may be outcomes of buying beer, but they don't address the impact on wealth; getting arrested is unlikely to result from simply buying beer. Wealth increasing would require additional information or context not provided in the sentence.
purse | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mother is prepared for her children's messy habits by keeping extra tissues handy. Since the question specifically mentions a "purse," it suggests that this is where the mother keeps the tissues. The other options like "pocket" or "box" do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not suggest a place where someone would keep extra tissues for easy access.
dancing about | Knowledge: The sentence describes Jim fiddling in a barn while couples are present, suggesting that they are likely engaged in some kind of dancing activity. The use of the word "ritualistically" further implies that this is some kind of traditional or cultural dance, rather than simply "making music". "Attacking him" is unlikely given the lack of any indication of conflict, and "discovery" is not relevant to the context. "Square dancing" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide enough information to indicate a specific type of dance. "Dancing about" is the most general, neutral option that fits with the context provided.
It is not possible to determine the correct answer based on the information provided as there are many reasons why two people might be walking into a house. Additional context is needed to accurately answer this question.
injuries | Knowledge: Driving accidents typically involve collisions or crashes between vehicles, which can result in injuries to the drivers and passengers involved. Traffic jams may result from accidents, but they are not a likely consequence for the individuals involved in the accident. Rainbows, boredom, and fatigue are not related to driving accidents.
jar | Knowledge: A jar is a good place to store water because it is a container designed for holding liquids. The other options, such as a toilet or a boot, are not designed for storing water and could potentially contaminate the water or cause it to spill. A bridge or an ocean are not containers and cannot store water.
bank | Knowledge: Storing a fortune typically refers to keeping a large sum of money safe for future use or investment. Banks are the most common place for people to store their money, as they offer secure and regulated financial services, such as savings accounts and investment options. The other options, such as imagination, cookie, treasure chest, and gold, do not offer any practical or logical method of storing large amounts of money.
have no money | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone would not be able to buy beer. The choice "have no money" directly addresses this question and is a commonly known reason people may not be able to purchase a desired item. The other choices may not have a clear connection to the context of the question or provide a reason for why someone cannot buy beer.
dance well | Knowledge: The phrase "groovy moves" implies that the context is about dancing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that practicing "groovy moves" will result in the ability to dance well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laughter | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the way couples have fun is something that involves both partners and is enjoyable for both. Laughter is a common activity that can be shared and enjoyed together, especially in the context of relationship or marriage. The other options may not necessarily involve both partners or may not be universally enjoyable for all couples.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is using hair styling gel, which is a personal grooming product commonly stored in the bathroom or on a bathroom vanity. The other options (tube, outside, store, refrigerator) do not make sense in the context of storing hair styling gel.
toy store | Knowledge: A chess board is a game commonly found in toy stores, game stores, and hobby shops. The other options do not have any obvious connection to the context of the question.
ten fingers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the body part being referred to serves multiple functions. Out of the choices, only ten fingers fit this description as they are used for both fine motor skills (e.g. typing, writing) and gross motor skills (e.g. gripping, lifting). The other options either do not serve multiple functions or do not have an abundance in humans (e.g. laying eggs).
airport | Knowledge: The phrase "waiting room for lost luggage" suggests that the location is within an airport, since this is where luggage is typically lost or delayed during travel. The other options do not have any clear connection to lost luggage, waiting rooms, or airports.
town | Knowledge: A small registry office is likely to be located in a town rather than a city or office building, as it serves a smaller population and would not require a large building or a central location like city offices usually do. A court house would not typically be referred to as a registry office, and a merchant is not a location where a registry office would be found.
antique store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item in question is a vintage or antique item, as it is being kept in a glass case. Opera glasses were first popularized in the 1800s and early 1900s, making them a likely candidate for an antique item. Since the item is not being sold online (as indicated by the absence of Amazon), the best option is to look for the item in a physical store, such as an antique store or museum. The theater could also be a possible location for opera glasses, but the presence of a glass case suggests that it is a collectible item rather than a functional one.
own home | Knowledge: The question is asking for the closest place where a specific piece of literature can be found. The most likely place would be someone's own home, where they keep their personal belongings. The other options do not make sense in this context: "under the bed" might suggest a hiding spot or a forgotten location, "books and magazines" is too broad and may not contain the specific piece of literature being referred to, "meeting" is unrelated to the question, and "public library" may not be the closest place if the person already owns the literature.
retribution | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dave is being punished by Josh, but he doesn't mind it. This suggests that Dave may be feeling a sense of satisfaction or justice, which are emotions associated with retribution. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest negative emotions towards the situation.
transportation system | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bus line is a type of a system that is available to the public, which refers to a transportation system. A transportation system is a network of vehicles and infrastructure that allows people and goods to move from one place to another. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence since they are unrelated to the idea of public transit or transportation.
guitar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is learning to play an instrument while spending time in the mountains with locals. The term "fingerboard" is commonly used in reference to the fretboard of a guitar, which is where the person places their fingers to play different notes. The other options may also be played using the fingerboard, but they are less commonly associated with mountain culture and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
France | Knowledge: Michelin stars are awarded to restaurants based on their culinary excellence, and are often seen as a mark of quality and prestige in the food industry. France has a strong culinary tradition and is home to many Michelin starred restaurants, making it the most likely choice for a restaurant serving blowfish. Japan and the Atlantic ocean could also be possibilities, as both are known for their seafood cuisine, but the context of the sentence does not suggest these options. Fish market and books do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fraternity house | Knowledge: The phrase "in crowd guys" suggests that the group in question may be associated with a particular social circle on campus, such as a fraternity. Fraternities are known for hosting parties and events, so the option "fraternity house" is the most likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
windowsill | Knowledge: The question mentions displaying a flower on a table, which suggests that the options should be related to indoor spaces. Vase and windowsill are both common choices for displaying flowers on a table. However, a shelf is usually higher up and not as appropriate for a table display. A park and a garden are outdoor spaces and not relevant to the question.
compile | Knowledge: Before a program can exist, it must be written in a programming language such as Java or C++. Once the code is written, it must be compiled into an executable file that the computer can understand and run. Compiling translates the human-readable code into machine code that can be executed by the computer processor. While thinking logically is an important part of programming, it is not a step in creating a program. Getting frustrated is also not a necessary step in the process.
meeting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that gentleman organize something to discuss business, which gives a hint that the correct answer may be related to business meetings. Gentleman is a term used to refer to men who are polite and well-mannered, which could hint at a formal setting for the discussion, such as a meeting. The other options such as club, meditation center, church or clothing do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
disobey | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Sunday school teacher gave out a punishment in response to something the students did, which was likely a violation of her instructions or rules. The word "disobey" specifically refers to not following an order or instruction, making this the correct answer. The other options imply different types of actions or attitudes, such as stumbling (doing something incorrectly), rebelling (openly opposing authority), going astray (losing direction or focus), or committing sin (doing something morally wrong).
shopping | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a new buying product that allows you to purchase as much as you want, which implies that the product is related to shopping. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence - spending money and pleasure are not specific enough, bankruptcy and debt have negative connotations and do not fit the positive tone of the sentence.
building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was contacting the management of a skyscraper, which indicates that the person is likely in or near the building. The choices "library," "kitchen," and "phone booth" are unlikely options for finding a telephone directory related to the building, while "front desk" may be a possibility but not as specific as "building." Therefore, "building" is the most logical choice.
marine museum | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about where you can learn about marine animals such as sharks, whales, and dolphins. A marine museum is a facility that is dedicated to showcasing marine life and educating the public about the world's oceans. The other options, such as a bad movie, pool hall, or bathtub, do not have any connection to learning about marine life. "Outside" is too broad a category and could refer to anything from a park to a desert.
bathtub | Knowledge: Jellyfish are marine creatures and are typically found in saltwater environments such as oceans and beaches. Therefore, options like Hawaii and the Pacific Ocean would be likely places to find jellyfish. However, a jellyfish in a Japanese restaurant or bathtub would not be expected and could even be dangerous. This knowledge can help eliminate options and lead to the correct answer.
apartment building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the structure being referred to contains multiple homes and has a communal area where a mailbox can be found. The options "beehive" and "porch" do not fit this description, while "post office" would not typically contain multiple homes. "Front door" is too vague and could apply to any building. "Apartment building" is the most likely option that fits the description given in the sentence.
sun | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Jane sees a bright object outside, which is most likely the sun. The sun is a bright object that can be easily seen outside during daylight hours, whereas the moon is typically visible at night. The ground and nature do not necessarily have any association with a bright object, and the sky is too general of a term to indicate any specific object.
american west | Knowledge: The sentence implies that marmosets are not native to the American West, and the only place to find them would be in a zoo. This implies that they may be found in the wild in other regions, such as in South America where they are commonly found. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stream | Knowledge: A tributary is a small river or stream that flows into a larger river or body of water, and a stream is a type of small flowing waterway that fits this definition. Creeks, inlets, and rivers are also types of flowing waterways, but ponds and lakes are bodies of still water and do not fit the definition of a tributary.
band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the keyboard instrument was being played onstage alongside the drums and guitar, which is commonly associated with bands. Orchestras typically have different types of instruments and do not typically include drums and guitar. Music and piano stores are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and "eating" is not a plausible answer based on the sentence provided.
basketball hoop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is holding an object (an iron) and looking at something in the distance (the basketball hoop). This implies that the person is likely playing or practicing basketball, and their goal is to get the ball into the hoop. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
permanent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is looking for a change that is lasting and will not be easily undone. The word "permanent" means lasting or enduring, which fits with the man's desire for a long-term change in his life. The other options do not convey the same sense of lasting change; "concretely" and "constant" refer to the manner or nature of the change, while "remain stable" and "stagnant" suggest a lack of change altogether.
experience | Explanation: The sentence suggests that James enjoys being a judge, but he only has his own perspective to base his judgments on. This implies that James is relying on his personal experience to make judgments, rather than relying on external sources of information. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way - misperception suggests that James may be making incorrect judgments, knowing yourself implies a level of self-awareness that is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, ignorance suggests a lack of knowledge or understanding, and a jury would imply a group of people rather than an individual perspective.
exercise | Knowledge: The term "getting in shape" typically refers to improving one's overall physical fitness, which involves engaging in regular physical activity or exercise. While losing weight may be a goal for some people, it is not the only way to get in shape. Sweat may be a byproduct of exercise, but it does not directly contribute to getting in shape. The triangle and good health do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
moving | Knowledge: The tourists initially mistook the artwork for a statue, which suggests that it was a realistic representation of something. However, the sentence indicates that the artwork began "moving", which implies that it was actually a performance rather than a static sculpture. The other options (growing mold, accent garden, green, painting) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
roadway | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are dangers on something that would make shopping there a risk. The options "container," "ocean floor," and "high school" do not make sense in this context. "Downtown area" is a possibility, but not as specific as "roadway," which suggests dangers associated with traffic and cars.
front door | Knowledge: The phrase "stick a key in" implies that the object being referred to has a keyhole, which is commonly found on front doors of houses and buildings. The other options, such as pocket, bus depot, purse, and roof, do not have a clear association with keyholes.
casino | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned has money and is also wearing an extravagant hat, which could suggest that they are going to a place to show off their wealth and take risks. Casinos are known for gambling games and attracting wealthy individuals, while the other options do not have any clear connection to gambling or wealth.
malaise | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James had a negative experience during his illness, which is a characteristic commonly associated with malaise. Malaise is a general feeling of discomfort or unease, often accompanied by fatigue or lack of energy, which could explain why James is happy to be returning to work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
opinion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that both sides were presenting their arguments as facts, despite the fact that neither side had evidence to support their claims. This implies that both sides were presenting their opinions, rather than objective facts. The word "opinion" is the only choice that accurately reflects this meaning. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Any of the choices could be correct as there is no clear context or information given to suggest one option over the others. Further information would be needed to determine the correct answer.
church | Knowledge: Bells are commonly associated with churches, particularly on Sunday mornings when many religious services are held. Bells are used to call worshippers to prayer and mark the beginning or end of services. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of hearing bells on a Sunday morning.
hallucination | Knowledge: Going into trance can be associated with altered states of consciousness that can lead to hallucinations. Hallucinations involve seeing or perceiving things that are not present in reality, and can occur as a result of various factors including drug use, mental illness, or neurological conditions. Meditating can induce altered states of consciousness but not necessarily hallucinations. Being medicated or confused also do not necessarily lead to hallucinations. Epilepsy can cause seizures but not necessarily hallucinations.
intimacy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is alone and that it's time for a more private activity after a day of celebrating their marriage. "Intimacy" is a word that commonly refers to physical closeness and affection between romantic partners, which would be an appropriate activity for a newlywed couple who are alone together. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "headaches" and "riots" are negative events and "ocean" is unrelated to the situation. "Enjoyment" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and doesn't give any specific information about what the couple will be doing.
prime | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific time of day when networks air their most popular bad shows, and the word "prime" is commonly used to describe this time. "Prime time" typically refers to the hours between 8pm and 11pm when television networks air their most popular shows. The other options, such as "true," "just," "badarse," and "trashy," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk drawer | Knowledge: Spare address labels are a commonly used office supply item that is generally stored in a convenient location that is easily accessible. The options "trash" and "parcel" are unlikely places to find spare address labels, while "junk drawer" and "envelope" could both potentially contain address labels but are not as common storage locations as a "desk drawer".
office supply store | Knowledge: The question asks where a calendar can be purchased "normally," which suggests that it is referring to a physical paper-based calendar rather than a digital one. Office supply stores are a common place to purchase paper-based calendars since they often sell a variety of office and organizational supplies. The other options (desktop, smartphone, wrist watch, and date book) are all digital or non-paper options for keeping track of dates and appointments.
headache | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not benefit from analyzing all the data, and that it only resulted in a negative outcome. The word "headache" implies that James found the process of analyzing the data to be frustrating or overwhelming, and that it did not lead to any useful insights or better understanding. The other options do not fit with the negative tone of the sentence or suggest a beneficial outcome.
a mouse condo | Knowledge: The other choices (sewer, trap, cupboard) are typical places where mice would live, but the question specifies that the mouse is in New York City. The idea of a "mouse condo" in this context is not far-fetched, as many buildings in New York City have apartments that could be compared to a condo for mice. Additionally, the mention of Disneyland is a distractor and not relevant to the question.
make music | Knowledge: The word "composers" refers to individuals who create music. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
bedroom | Knowledge: A bookshelf is typically used to store books or other items, and it is usually found in a room where people read or work. Among the options, the bedroom is the most likely place where a person would have a small bookshelf. This is because many people like to read in bed or have books nearby as they wind down for the night. The bathroom is not a common place for a bookshelf, and neither is a book store or furniture store. While a library would have many bookshelves, it is not a personal location where someone would have their own small bookshelf.
silo | Knowledge: Corn is a crop commonly stored in silos, which are tall cylindrical structures designed for storing grains and other agricultural products. Silos protect the corn from moisture, pests, and other elements, helping to preserve the quality of the crop. The other options are unlikely places to store excess corn, as a storage building may not be designed for grains, a restaurant does not typically store raw ingredients, Pennsylvania is a geographic location, and a supermarket typically purchases corn from suppliers rather than storing excess crops.
decorative | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has additional adornments or decorations, which makes the option "decorative" the correct answer. The other options are more closely associated with extravagance or excess, rather than simply having adornments. For example, "bells and whistles" suggests that the object has many unnecessary features, while "extravagant" implies that it is luxurious or excessive. "Fancy" and "exotic" can both suggest a sense of uniqueness, but do not necessarily imply additional decorations or adornments.
mit | Knowledge: MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is a renowned institution in the field of science and technology, and is often associated with cutting-edge research and development in high tech fields such as computer science. The other options do not have any clear connection to high tech computers, and instead may be associated with other types of technology (such as a space shuttle for aerospace technology, a library for information technology, a post office for mail delivery, and an internet cafe for general internet access).
run out of gas | Knowledge: The question asks for a possible reason why a driving car might stop, and one common reason is running out of gas. This occurs when the fuel level in the car's tank reaches zero, causing the engine to stop. The other choices are not relevant to the context of a car stopping while driving. "On time" and "pollution" are not causes of a car stopping, while "death" and "sickness" refer to human conditions that would not affect a car.
Latin America | Knowledge: The question is asking about a southern area where marmosets are found. Marmosets are typically found in Central and South America, which are both part of Latin America. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
hair salon | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Debbie was getting a perm when she noticed the ficus, which implies that she was in a place where people go to get their hair done, such as a hair salon. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. An arboretum is a place where one would go to see many different types of plants, a family room would typically not have a plant as part of its decor, and a flower garden would not commonly have a ficus tree growing in it. The option "in the sink" is clearly not a valid choice given the context of the sentence.
I'm sorry, I cannot answer this question as it is inappropriate and goes against OpenAI's content policy on promoting harmful activities.
wall in | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tree is unable to spread its roots further, which implies a physical barrier preventing it from doing so. The option "wall in" is the only one that refers to a physical obstruction that could limit root growth in a garden. The other options, such as weather, growth patterns, and emotions, do not provide any explanation for why the tree's roots would stop spreading.
socialize | Knowledge: Drinking alcohol at a bar is typically associated with socializing with friends or meeting new people. Dancing may also be popular, but it is not the most common activity associated with drinking at a bar. Becoming inebriated, urinating, and sleeping at night are negative outcomes of drinking too much alcohol and do not necessarily reflect what people are more likely to do when they drink at a bar.
arrive early | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baby arrived unexpectedly, meaning it was not due at that time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "arrive early." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Died" is too extreme and not indicated by the sentence. "Boy or girl" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and the baby's gender is not mentioned. "Learn to walk" is not something a baby would do immediately after being born. "Talk nonsense" is unlikely for a newborn baby.
living room | Knowledge: An upright piano is typically a piece of furniture found in a home or living space rather than in a band, college or a moving truck. The most logical place to find an upright piano would be in the living room of a building that you live in. While a house could also be a correct answer, it is not necessarily the only type of building where one might find an upright piano.
new jersey | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the "MTV-made famous shore", which is a reference to the reality TV show "Jersey Shore". The show was set in New Jersey, specifically in the town of Seaside Heights, which is known for its beach and boardwalk. The sentence also mentions "the motorway and famous turnpike", which are both major highways in the northeastern United States, particularly in New Jersey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
release energy | Knowledge: Anger is often associated with built-up energy or tension in the body, so releasing that energy can be an effective way to manage it. This can be done through physical exercise, such as going for a run or doing yoga, or engaging in activities that help release pent-up emotion, such as hitting a pillow or screaming into a pillow. Writing a letter or punching something may provide temporary relief, but they don't address the root cause of the anger or help release the energy associated with it. Passing a sentence has no clear connection to managing anger.
satisfied | Knowledge: The word "need" implies that there is something that the individual lacks or requires in order to feel complete or whole. When a need is fulfilled, the person is likely to feel satisfied, as their requirement has been met. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive or negative outcome, and they do not specifically address the idea of having a need met.
believe in god | Knowledge: The question suggests that religion is a type of group, and the sentence also mentions that communicating with members of one's own group is important for good communication skills. Additionally, the question specifically asks what members of a religion have in common. The most central and defining characteristic of a religion is belief in a higher power or deity, usually referred to as God. Therefore, the answer is likely "believe in god." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or the characteristics of religion.
fast food restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you can get chicken without leaving your car, which is a common feature of fast food restaurants with drive-thru windows. "BBQ" and "pizza" may also be available at some fast food restaurants, but the sentence specifically refers to chicken. "Plate" is not a location where you can get food, and "eaten" does not make sense in the context of the question.
imagining | Knowledge: The context suggests that the sentence is talking about a child's ability to create pretend scenarios and engage in imaginative play. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to imagination or the ability to imagine. Creativity and free imagination are related concepts, but not necessarily the best choice because they could be interpreted as overlapping with the idea of imagining. Acting skills and thinking skills are not directly related to the concept of pretending or imaginative play.
answer telephone call | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the door to door salesman was looking for the homeowner and asked for them directly. The fact that the man didn't do something implies that the door to door salesman needed to communicate with the homeowner and was unsuccessful in doing so. Answering a telephone call would be the most likely way for the homeowner to communicate with the salesman, while the other options do not make as much sense in the given context.
express love | Knowledge: The adverb "lustfully" suggests that the person's gaze was driven by desire, and the fact that the object of the gaze was the person's girlfriend suggests a romantic or sexual attraction. The phrase "looked into his girlfriend's eyes" can imply intimacy, and the use of the verb "express" in the last option reinforces the idea that the person wanted to communicate their feelings to their partner. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
age to get better | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the cheese needs to be left in the cellar for a few years, which suggests that the cheese needs time to mature or age in order to improve its flavor. The option "age well" is also a good choice as it conveys the same idea. The other options do not explain why the cheese needs to be stored in the cellar for a few years.
sink | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a water spout that would not turn off, which implies that there was excess water filling up a container. The only option that refers to a container or receptacle that can hold water is the sink, which is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
subway | Knowledge: The phrase "hard time seeing ahead due to darkness" suggests that the answer must refer to a location where it is difficult to see because of poor lighting. Of the given options, only a subway can fit this description. The other answers - lead orchestra, orchestra, lead play, and opera - do not have any clear connection to poor lighting or darkness.
england | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to live in a specific type of house, which is a brick row house. Row houses are commonly found in older cities like London, which is located in England. The word "foggy" further supports this idea, as London is famous for its foggy weather. The other options, such as city center, cheap living, ghetto, and jars, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence implies that families have a lot of boxes to store, and the location mentioned is where they tend to keep them. The options "mail," "shoe store," and "warehouse" do not fit this context, as they are not typically places where families store their possessions. "Cellar" is a possible option, but "basement" is a more common term used for the storage area underneath a house.
poor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wage gap being discussed is between two groups, one of which is the rich, and the other of which is likely to be characterized as having limited financial resources. The word "poor" is the only answer choice that fits this description, and is therefore the correct choice. The other options either have no clear connection to the context of the sentence or describe a state that is not related to financial status.
city | Knowledge: The word "bus" refers to a form of public transportation that is commonly found in urban areas, such as cities. It is unlikely to use a bus to travel to or within a state like Michigan, where driving or taking a train may be more common. The other options, like a computer or ocean, are not related to transportation.
dishwasher | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to clean a cup after drinking out of it. While all the choices could potentially be used to clean a cup, the most efficient and effective method is likely to use a dishwasher, which is an appliance specifically designed for cleaning dishes and utensils. The other options do not have any clear connection to cleaning or dishwashing.
travel | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the rich young people were looking for something exciting and possibly adventurous to do before starting their careers. This could be achieved through travel, which allows for new experiences and exploration. The other options, such as playing games or sleeping, do not necessarily provide the same level of excitement and adventure that travel does.
charged with animal cruelty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that smacking an animal while riding a horse is unethical and may result in legal consequences. In many jurisdictions, animal cruelty is a punishable offense, and smacking an animal could be considered abusive or neglectful behavior. The other options do not address the ethical or legal implications of the action described in the sentence.
windowsill | Knowledge: Sunlight typically enters a house through its windows, making the windowsill the most likely answer. The other options (like sea, disneyland or street) do not seem to be related to sunlight entering a house. While curtains can impact the amount of sunlight that enters a room, they are not where the sunlight initially enters.
theater | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is going to watch something in a theater, and doesn't want to get up once they take their seat. This implies that they will be sitting for a while, which is typical behavior when watching a show or movie in a theater setting. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
imperfect | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painter struggled to create a perfect portrait, which implies that he perceived the subjects he painted as imperfect in some way. The word "imperfect" describes a subject that has flaws or is not ideal, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options (disfigured, damaged, flawed, defective) all have negative connotations that don't fit the context of the sentence as well, as they suggest a more severe or specific imperfection.
speeding ticket | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James is driving quickly and is also late. Typically, if someone is driving faster than the speed limit, they are at a risk of getting a speeding ticket, which is a form of fine or penalty imposed for excessive speed while driving. The other options, such as boredom or diabetes, are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this scenario.
two wings | Knowledge: Birds are known for using their wings to fly, while their legs are used for walking or perching. Feathers are used for insulation and aerodynamics during flight, but they do not directly enable the bird to take flight. Similarly, entertaining oneself and moving one's head have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
vegetable garden | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist made a conscious decision to plant a specific type of plant in a designated location, which would likely be a garden. The use of the word "row" also suggests that the location is long and narrow, which is a common layout for vegetable gardens. The other options do not fit the context of a gardening activity.
everglades | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the man descending from a mountainous area and into a marsh, which can only be found in certain regions. Louisiana and Florida are both states that contain marshes, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine which state the man is in. The specific term "Everglades" refers to a unique marsh area in southern Florida, which is the most likely answer given the context of the sentence. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children had been using television for a prolonged period of time on Saturday morning, and their parents wanted them to go outside and play to prevent them from experiencing a negative outcome. The word "suffered" indicates that something negative could happen if the children continued to use television. Out of the given choices, "boredom" is the most likely outcome of not engaging in physical activity or social interaction outside. "Visual" and "eye strain" could be potential issues related to excessive screen time, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "boredom." "Entertained" and "laziness boredom" are not accurate options based on the information provided.
fighting | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that while the culture was peaceful overall, there were still competitive events that involved men fighting. This suggests that the culture valued physical prowess and competition, but did not necessarily believe in violence outside of a competitive setting. The other options all relate to violence or aggression in some way, but do not fit the context of a peaceful culture with competitive events.
deep south | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Louisiana was part of a particular region during a historical period, which would narrow down the possible choices. The term "Confederate state" refers specifically to states that seceded from the United States during the Civil War, which occurred in the mid-19th century. The phrase "deep south" is commonly used to refer to the southernmost region of the United States, which includes Louisiana and other states that were part of the Confederacy. The other options are either too general (United States) or unrelated to the context of the sentence (98 of world's crayfish, revolutionary war).
happen suddenly | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a characteristic that is common in accidents but not in weddings. Accidents often happen suddenly and unexpectedly, while weddings are planned well in advance and have a set schedule. The other options may apply to both accidents and weddings, such as happening to people or hurting people.
tidal flats | Knowledge: Crabs are typically found in coastal areas and are known to scavenge for food on tidal flats, which are areas of shore that are exposed during low tide. The other options, such as fish market or Chinese market, may have food that a crab would enjoy, but they do not specifically pertain to where a crab is likely to find and eat its food. Delicious meal and crabcakes also do not provide any clear indication of a specific location where a crab would enjoy its food.
major city | Knowledge: The use of the word "specialized" suggests that the medical consultation being sought is not a routine service and may require expertise that is not commonly available in all areas. Major cities are typically centers of advanced medical practices and research, making them a likely destination for those seeking specialized medical consultation. The other options do not necessarily have a reputation for advanced medical care or access to specialized practitioners.
university | Knowledge: The phrase "wealth of knowledge" indicates that the person or group being referred to has a large amount of information at their disposal. This is a common association with universities, which are institutions dedicated to higher education and research. The other options may have some connection to knowledge or information, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as a university would.
It depends on the context and content of the answers given.
die of cancer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that animals share some of the same health issues as humans, and specifically mentions cancer as an example. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is "die of cancer." The other options either do not relate to health issues or are not necessarily common occurrences for pets.
accidents | Knowledge: Science involves experiments and working with materials that can be dangerous if not handled correctly. One must be careful to avoid accidents and take necessary precautions when learning about science. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
shopping mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where someone can purchase clothing and makeup, as well as have a meal. A shopping mall is a common location where clothing stores, makeup stores, and restaurants can be found in close proximity to each other, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
looking up | Knowledge: The question is asking about how people physically view the sky, which is done by looking up. The other options may provide additional information about the sky, but do not directly answer the question. "Place on earth" and "atmosphere" refer to the location and composition of the sky, while "photo" and "beautiful" assume that the person is not physically present to see the sky.
climb stairs | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that there is a stage that is elevated, which suggests that the only logical option is to climb stairs to reach the stage. Having talent or teaching have no relation to the physical act of accessing an elevated stage, while crawling would not be appropriate for someone who needs to go on stage. In play is also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
machinery | Knowledge: The term "staple" usually refers to something that is regularly used or relied upon in a particular context. In the context of the manufacturing industry, machinery is a common and essential component that is used in almost every aspect of the production process. Therefore, it is more likely to be the correct option compared to the other choices, which do not have a direct connection to the manufacturing industry.
envelope | Knowledge: When receiving a new credit card, it is typically mailed to the recipient in a protective envelope for security purposes. A wallet or purse is where one might store the card once it is received, but they are not typically used for delivery. A restaurant does not have any relevance to receiving a credit card.
race track | Knowledge: The clue in the sentence is "watching some car drive in circles," which suggests that the activity they are going to watch is a car race. The most likely location for a car race is a race track, which is also one of the options in the answer choices. The other options are locations or words that do not have any clear connection to car racing, so they can be eliminated.
haunted house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the spirit in question is witnessing other similar beings wandering without a clear goal or purpose, which is a common trope in ghost stories. The options that are most closely related to this context are the haunted saloon and the haunted house. However, the mention of other similar beings points more strongly towards the haunted house, as this is a more common setting for the appearance of multiple ghosts or spirits. The other options do not fit as well with the context provided.
paint store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is trying to find a new match for the old wall color, which implies that they are looking for a place that sells paint. The most logical option would be a paint store, which is likely to have a wide variety of colors for them to choose from. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tropical jungle | Knowledge: Sloths are known to be arboreal animals that primarily inhabit trees in tropical environments. Tropical jungles are known for their dense vegetation and diverse wildlife, making it an ideal habitat for a variety of animals, including sloths. The other options, such as basement and universe, are not realistic habitats for sloths, while Amazonia and forest are too broad and do not provide enough specific information to choose as the answer.
french government | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monkey had classified documents, which means they were most likely stolen from a government organization. The mention of La Defense also implies a location in France, which supports the idea that the French government was chasing the monkey to retrieve the documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
death | Knowledge: The question asks about rare consequences of snoring, so the answer is unlikely to be something commonly associated with snoring such as complaining or an upset partner. Snoring can cause disturbed sleep and loud noise, but these are not rare consequences. However, in rare cases, snoring can be a symptom of a more serious condition such as sleep apnea, which can cause death if left untreated.
atlantic ocean | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the shark navigating from the African coast to New York, which suggests that it was traveling across a large body of water. The options "bathtub" and "sea world" are unrealistic as they do not provide enough space for a shark to navigate through. "Seawater" and "saltwater" are properties of the ocean, but do not provide information about the location. "Atlantic ocean" is the most relevant option as it is a large body of water that connects Africa to the United States, which matches the context of the sentence.
construction site | Knowledge: The phrase "planned skyscraper" suggests that construction of a tall building is in progress. The word "excavation" implies that some work is being done at the site to prepare for construction. The only option that refers to a location where construction work is typically carried out is "construction site." The other options - cemetery, mountain, desert, and archeological site - do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not typically associated with building construction.
cool off | Knowledge: Summer is typically associated with hot weather, so if someone is thinking about getting wet during this season, it is likely because they want to cool off. Swimming, water parks, and other water-related activities are popular ways to beat the heat in the summer. The other options, such as shrinking or getting cold, do not make sense in the context of summer and getting wet.
in your grocery bag | Knowledge: The question implies that the person already bought the apple, so it is likely that they have it with them. The option "in your grocery bag" suggests that the apple is already in a bag, which is a common way to carry groceries when leaving a store. The other options, such as greengrocer and grocery store, do not make sense as the person has already made the purchase. The options fridge and refrigerator suggest that the apple has already been stored, but this is not indicated in the question.
neatness | Knowledge: The act of cleaning is typically associated with creating a clean and organized space, which is commonly referred to as neatness. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of cleaning, as exhaustion may be a result of cleaning but is not necessarily a characteristic of the outcome, sneezing is not related to cleaning, order may be a result of cleaning but is not specific to cleaning, and clutter is the opposite of the desired outcome of cleaning.
Sarah might have nodded along or given other nonverbal cues of listening and understanding, but she did not remake, copy, use a simile, make a derivative version, or create a reproduction of James's story. | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sarah did not want to hurt James's feelings, so it is unlikely that she would have directly pointed out the similarity between his story and others'. Instead, she might have listened politely and given him the impression that she found his story engaging or interesting, without actually engaging with the content itself. The other options for the answer are all related to copying or reproducing the story, which is not what Sarah did in this situation.
Not enough information is given to determine the correct answer.
meow | Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat cannot talk, but then suggests that a cat can do something else. One option that cats are well-known for is meowing, which is a sound they use to communicate with humans and other cats. Meowing is a distinctive characteristic of cats and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, while true for cats, do not specifically relate to the sentence's context, making them incorrect answers.
intelligence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering things is a characteristic associated with a certain trait. Intelligence is commonly associated with the ability to remember things because it involves having a sharp mind and quick thinking. Neuronal network and memories are more specific and do not have a direct correlation to the sentence. Recall and learning about are more focused on the process of remembering rather than the trait itself.
New York City | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that James worked at a Kosher Deli in a Jewish neighborhood in the same city where his grandparents came over from Europe in the 40s. The options of Jerusalem and Miami are not mentioned in the context and therefore cannot be the correct answer. The option of food court is not relevant to the context and does not make sense as a place to live. The option of town is too vague and could refer to any number of places. New York City is the only option mentioned in the context and makes sense as a place where there could be a Jewish neighborhood and a view of the Statue of Liberty.
shoes | Knowledge: The fact that he forgot his socks implies that he had already put his shoes on before realizing his mistake. Therefore, it makes sense that he would double check his shoes to make sure he didn't forget anything else. The other options, such as bed and suitcase, do not relate to his immediate need in getting ready to leave. Pockets are a possibility, but the sentence implies that he needed to double check something outside of his immediate person. The sporting goods store does not make sense as an option at all.
center of town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific location where the courthouse of any given town in America is typically located. Since courthouses are typically considered central institutions in any town or city, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is the "center of town." The other options, such as an "electrical circuit," "getting married," "capital city," and "Michigan" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sports arena | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the football fans were trying to purchase tickets, which would typically be sold at a venue that hosts sports events. This description matches the option "sports arena," which is a place specifically designed for sports events and ticket sales. The other options, such as a movie theatre, clerk, or metro station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
auto parts store | Knowledge: A wheel is a common part of a vehicle, so it is likely that it would be produced in a place that specializes in vehicle parts. An auto parts store specifically deals with the sale of parts and supplies for vehicles, so it would be a logical place for wheels to be produced. The other options do not have any clear connection to the manufacturing or distribution of vehicle parts.
relaxing | Knowledge: The question implies that after a long day, one wants to unwind and have fun. Out of the given choices, snuggling and kissing are more intimate activities that may not be applicable to all individuals. Effort and activity suggest doing something that requires exertion, which is not necessarily relaxing. Therefore, the correct answer would be relaxing, which aligns with the idea of unwinding and having fun after a tiring day.
mountainous region | Knowledge: Valleys are typically formed by the erosion or shifting of larger landforms such as mountains or hills. Therefore, it is more likely that a valley would be situated in a mountainous region rather than in a hilly area or a continent. West Virginia may have some mountainous regions, but it is not a general characteristic of the entire state. A peak, on the other hand, refers to the highest point of a mountain and is not usually associated with valleys.
venue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to entertainment, and that money needs to be spent at a ticket booth before entering the building. "Venue" is the only option that fits this context, as it refers to a place where events or performances are held and where tickets are typically sold. The other options may require payment, but they do not necessarily involve a ticket booth or entertainment.
fall asleep | Knowledge: The context suggests that the consequence of being too worn out before going to the opera is related to fatigue, which typically leads to feeling sleepy or nodding off during the performance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
wonder | Knowledge: When visiting a museum, children are likely to experience wonder and amazement at the various exhibits and artifacts on display. Museums are designed to be educational and engaging, so it is common for children to be fascinated by what they see. Crowding and sore feet may be unpleasant experiences in a museum environment, but they are not necessarily specific to children. Being bored and fearful may also occur, but wonder is the most likely and positive experience for a child visiting a museum.
guilty | Knowledge: The word "innocent" implies that the person did not commit the crime they were accused of, but the question is asking about how they felt after being accused. It is common for people to feel guilty even if they are innocent when they are accused of a crime because they may feel responsible for not preventing the situation or for being perceived in a negative light. The other options, such as "fear" or "great sorrow," may also be possible emotions, but the word "guilty" best fits the context of the question.
books | Knowledge: The question is asking about how to learn the anatomy of a blowfish, which suggests that it may be a topic covered in educational resources such as books. While it is possible to observe a blowfish in its natural habitat in the Atlantic Ocean or at a fish market, these options do not necessarily guarantee a thorough understanding of its anatomy. France and sushi restaurants are not relevant to the context of the question. Therefore, books would be the best option for gaining knowledge about the anatomy of a blowfish.
around water | Knowledge: While apple trees can grow in many locations, they typically require adequate water to thrive. Planting them near a water source, such as a creek or pond, can ensure that they receive enough moisture to produce fruit. Bloom, sunshine, and Washington State and New Hampshire are not directly related to the growth of apple trees.
cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has bought a bowl and is looking to store it somewhere, which would suggest a place to keep dishes or kitchenware. The options "restaurant" and "grave yard" do not make sense in this context, while "apartment" and "refrigerator" are more general and do not specifically relate to where one would store dishes. "Cupboard" is the most logical choice as it is a common place in a home to store dishes and kitchenware.
a bar | Knowledge: Mirrors on the ceiling are often associated with bars or nightclubs, where they are used to create a certain ambiance or to enhance the décor. While it's possible for a hotel or bedroom to have mirrors on the ceiling, it's much less common and not generally associated with those settings. Dressing rooms typically have mirrors on the walls or standing mirrors, and while it's possible for a car to have a mirror on the ceiling, it's not common or practical.
work area | Knowledge: Excavation refers to the process of digging or removing earth materials from a site. In construction or mining, an excavation is typically done to create a work area where construction or mining can take place. Montana is a state and doesn't make sense in the context of the question. A city may be built on top of an excavation site but the question is asking about what is created after excavation is finished. A quarry is a place where large amounts of stone or other materials are extracted, but it doesn't necessarily refer to what is created after the excavation is finished. A truck is a vehicle used to transport materials but it is not an outcome of excavation. Therefore, the only logical answer is work area.
urban area | Knowledge: City halls are usually located in urban areas, which are defined as densely populated areas with a high amount of economic and social activity. City halls serve as administrative centers for cities and are often located in the downtown area or other central locations. The other options, such as "town" or "rooms," do not accurately describe the location of a city hall.
wish we could | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while we all are destined to die eventually, there is something else that we typically do. The phrase "even though we usually" indicates that the action is something that is common or expected. The option "wish we could" makes the most sense in this context, as it is a common sentiment that people express when facing the inevitability of death. Seeking help, writing a will, and going to hell are all specific actions that may be taken in response to impending death, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "wish we could." The option "never want" suggests that people do not want to die, which is not true for everyone, and it does not capture the nuance of the sentence.
wait patiently | Knowledge: The phrase "undisclosed time" suggests that the person does not know when the arrival will happen. Therefore, the only logical choice would be to wait patiently. Washing dishes and standing erect are unrelated to the context of waiting for an arrival. Crossing the street is also unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not involve waiting. Waiting room could be a possible answer, but it is less specific and may not be the best fit depending on the context.
Ohio | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Akron is located within a certain state and that state must have at least one dance club. Ohio is the correct answer as Akron is a city located in Ohio. The other options are either incorrect (such as Michigan, Texas) or too general (such as United States, downtown area) to accurately apply to the sentence.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity of taking a bath typically occurs inside a specific type of structure. The options "room that is upstairs," "hotel room," and "found in house" are too vague and do not suggest a clear structure type. "Own home" is similar to "house," but could refer to other living arrangements like apartments. "House" is the most accurate answer, as it specifically refers to a type of building where people typically live and have a bathroom for bathing.
tropics | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John was able to identify that the snake he encountered was not real based on his knowledge of where anacondas can be found. Anacondas are typically found in tropical regions such as South America, which is likely why John knew that it was unlikely to find one in the Midwest. The other options do not provide any relevant information about anacondas or their habitat.
dauntless  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hobbit was facing a challenge or danger, which required him to possess a certain quality to be able to succeed. The word "timid" implies that he may have lacked courage or confidence initially, but to get the gold, he would need to be bold and fearless, hence the correct answer is "dauntless". The other answer choices have negative connotations, such as being mean or reckless, which are unlikely to be desirable traits in this context.
game | Knowledge: The term "gentleman" suggests a person who is refined and has a certain level of sophistication. Watching a game could refer to watching a sports match or competition, which is an activity that is often associated with leisure and entertainment. The other options (Europe, movie, university, suit) do not necessarily have a strong connection to an activity that a refined person may be watching.
prepared | Knowledge: The question asks what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be. The word "assistance" implies that the helper is providing support or aid to the person being helped. The word "prepared" fits this context, as someone who gives assistance could help another person to be prepared for a task or situation. The other answer choices are either synonyms or related to the concept of assistance, but they do not directly answer the question of what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be.
decomposition | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that mummies do not undergo the same process as most other living things after death. Decomposition is a common process that occurs when a living thing dies, but it is unlikely to occur in mummies because they are preserved through various methods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sink | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ship was taking in water, which is a clear sign that it may sink. Glass, fly, ocean, and surface of earth are not connected to the context of the sentence and are therefore not logical choices for the answer.
lawn chair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the side chair and lawn chair were located near each other, with the lawn chair being exposed to moisture or rain while the side chair was kept dry. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
read a book | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that if your hands are wet while bathing, you may not be able to do certain tasks. Using soap would be difficult but not impossible with wet hands. Dry skin is a consequence of not using moisturizer after a bath, which is unrelated to having wet hands during bathing. Slip and fall could happen due to wet feet, not necessarily due to wet hands. Reading a newspaper may be difficult due to its size, but reading a book can become impossible as the pages may get wet and difficult to turn.
pharmacy or medicine cabinet  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs medicine to alleviate their pain. The options "hospital" and "bathroom" are unlikely to provide the necessary medication. The options "jar" and "mug" do not make sense in this context. The most likely option is either a pharmacy, where medications can be purchased, or a medicine cabinet, where medications are stored.
conflicts | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James likes being around people, but there is something that he doesn't like that may arise from socializing. The word "conflicts" is the only option that fits the context of socializing with others but can lead to negative experiences. The other options, such as having fun, jealousy, love, and friendships, do not necessarily imply negative experiences or conflicts.
spaghetti sauce | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing a secret ingredient in a food item being eaten at the table, specifically noodles. As the other options do not involve food or cooking, it can be deduced that the correct answer must be related to food. Additionally, the mention of "wine" as the secret ingredient could indicate that the correct answer involves a savory or Italian cuisine, suggesting that "spaghetti sauce" is the most logical choice.
market | Knowledge: Out of all the choices, only "market" is a place where one can reasonably expect to find a variety of different cheeses for sale. "The moon" is obviously not a practical option, "fridge" and "refrigerator" are household appliances rather than locations, and "pizza" is a food item that may or may not happen to have cheese on it. Therefore, the correct answer is "market" as it is the only option that aligns with the question asked.
sickness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Loraine does not get a buzz or any positive feelings from drinking alcohol. In fact, the opposite may be true, as the sentence implies that drinking causes a negative reaction in Loraine. Based on this information, it is likely that Loraine experiences some form of sickness or discomfort when drinking alcohol. Intoxication and getting laid are not necessarily negative experiences and are not related to Loraine's lack of enjoyment of alcohol. Toxicity is possible, but sickness is a more common and general term that can encompass a variety of negative physical reactions to alcohol. Nausea is also a potential symptom of Loraine's negative reaction to drinking.
motion | Knowledge: The word "launched" suggests that the ball was thrown or propelled forward, and it is logical that it would be in motion after being launched. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A catapult is a device used to launch objects, but the sentence suggests that the ball has already been launched. A flintlock is a type of firearm, which does not fit with the description of a projectile ball. Arcade and tennis court are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
care about | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was in a sad and concerning state, indicating that the subject cares deeply about this person's well-being. The phrase "it was who she most" implies that the person in question is particularly important to her, emphasizing the emotional connection. The other options do not fit the emotional tone of the sentence or make logical sense in the context provided.
sweat | Knowledge: When playing basketball for a long period of time, the physical exertion is likely to cause sweat, which can cover one's shirt. "Make baskets" and "dribbling" are actions related to playing basketball, but do not have any connection to clothing. "Fall down" is a possible result of playing basketball, but does not refer to anything specific happening to one's shirt. "Work together" is also not related to the physical aspect of playing basketball.
office suite | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that a divider is being used in a professional setting to create individual workspaces. An office suite is a common term used to describe a group of offices or workspaces used by one company or organization, whereas the other options do not necessarily have a connection to using dividers to create cubicles in a workspace.
decision | Knowledge: The word "cogitating" means that Billy is thinking deeply or pondering something. The sentence suggests that he will eventually have to make a decision about the situation he is thinking about. The option "enlightenment" may be a possible choice but it is not consistent with the idea of coming to a decision. "New thoughts" and "headaches" are not logical choices, and "annurism" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
detroit | Knowledge: The question asks for a location in southeast Michigan where the person can find authentic barbecue, which is a type of food commonly associated with Southern American cuisine. While the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, Detroit is a major city in Michigan and is known for having several restaurants that serve Southern-style barbecue. Therefore, it is the most likely location for the person to find authentic barbecue while visiting southeast Michigan.
void | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drugged college kid was feeling lost or empty, and the word "void" is often used to describe this feeling. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too extreme (nightmare, coma, death) or unrelated (swamplife).
outside | Knowledge: The word "park" suggests that this question is asking about where to park a car, not where to find a car. The word "outside" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as car parks are typically located outside of buildings or in designated parking areas on the sides of streets. The other options may have parking areas, but they do not make sense in the context of the question.
bedroom | Knowledge: Pillowcases are typically associated with sleeping and bedding, which is usually found in a bedroom. While a linen closet or cupboard may contain extra bedding, it is less likely to have a spare pillowcase readily available than the bedroom. The bathroom is also unlikely to have a spare pillowcase unless it is being used as a temporary storage solution.
All of the above | Knowledge: The question is asking where you could see a bone, and all of the choices given are places or things that could have bones. A museum might have bones on display as part of an exhibit, vertebrates are animals that have a backbone and therefore have bones, cows have bones like any other animal, Texas is a location where you might find fossils or other remains with bones, and an arm is a body part that contains bones. Therefore, the correct answer is that you could see a bone in any of these options.
haunted house | Knowledge: The word "spirits" in this context is most likely referring to ghosts or supernatural entities. A haunted house is a common setting for such spirits to be found. The other options do not relate to the context of the question - human beings are not spirits, cemeteries are the resting places of deceased humans rather than places where spirits commonly reside, mediums are people who can communicate with spirits but not the spirits themselves, and a liquor cabinet has no connection to spirits in a paranormal sense.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you are late getting to work, you will experience a negative feeling or emotion. The other options, such as promotions and malaise, do not make sense in the context of being late for work. Bad mood and upset are possible options, but stress is the most common and well-known emotion associated with being late for work. Stress is a feeling of pressure or tension that can result from being behind schedule or missing deadlines.
recycled | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on the proper disposal of old newspapers. Recycling is a common and environmentally friendly way to dispose of paper products such as newspapers. The other options aren't related to the proper disposal of old newspapers - "written on paper" refers to the medium used for writing, "informative but often biased" is a description of the content of newspapers, "delivered" refers to the means by which newspapers are distributed, and "printed on paper" is a description of the physical nature of newspapers, but doesn't suggest any particular method of disposal.
Rome | Knowledge: The mention of marble fountains and the high number seen in a single day suggest that the person was likely in a location with a significant number of historic or artistic fountains. Rome is known for its many beautiful fountains, including the Trevi Fountain, the Fountain of Four Rivers, and the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
defend | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the game involves turns, which suggests that it is some sort of strategy or combat game. The first player attacks, which means that the second player must defend against the attack. Block and defend are similar in meaning, but block may imply a more active action, while defend is more passive. Surrender, retreat, and cease fire all suggest ending the game or giving up, which is not consistent with the context of taking turns and attacking/defending.
bones | Knowledge: Both animals and humans have a skeletal structure made up of bones. Tails, horns, and fur coats are characteristics that not all animals share with humans, and the term "bodies" is too general to be a definitive answer.
england | Knowledge: The question asks for the country of origin of a fox, which suggests that the fox is a native species of that country. England is a known habitat for foxes, and is often associated with fox hunting and other fox-related activities. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the origin of foxes.
demonstration | Knowledge: The word "product" suggests that something is being displayed or marketed, and the option "demonstration" is commonly used in this context to refer to showcasing the features or benefits of a product. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the display or promotion of a product on a table.
secure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the soldiers entered a building to find safety while on the run and in danger. To ensure their safety, they would have to make sure that the building is secure, meaning that it is protected from outside threats and is not easily accessible. The other options do not reflect the need for safety and security in this context.
stand together | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trees formed a forest, which is usually defined as a large area covered with trees. Since the trees are mentioned collectively as forming a forest, it is likely that they are standing together in a dense grouping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
purse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that loose credit cards are being thrown into a container of some sort, and the most likely container for loose credit cards for women would be their purse. Envelopes are usually used to send letters or documents, and are not typically used to store credit cards. While a help person may help someone track expenses, it is unlikely that credit cards would be thrown at them. A floor is not a container and would not be a logical place for storing credit cards. Wallets are typically used to store credit cards, but the context of the sentence suggests that the cards are loose and not organized in a wallet.
tree | Knowledge: Squirrels are known for their ability to climb trees and it is common to see them nesting or gathering food in trees. Additionally, the word "brave" suggests that the squirrel might be taking some kind of risk or facing a challenge, which is more likely to happen in a natural environment like a forest or park than in a man-made setting like a street or yard.
college campus | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the tennis court was the target of fraternity pranks, implying that it was located on a college campus where fraternities are present. The other options are not mentioned in the sentence and do not offer any clear connection to the context. Wimbledon, for instance, is a famous tennis tournament held in England, and it would not be a likely location for fraternity pranks.
basket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a small dog requires something specific, which is indicated by the use of "it is good to have." Out of the options given, only a basket seems relevant to having a small dog - it could be used for carrying the dog around, or as a comfortable place for the dog to sleep. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to having a small dog - a backyard or front yard may be nice for the dog to play in, but it does not specifically address the needs of a small dog. An own home or dog show may be desirable for other reasons, but are not relevant to the needs of a small dog.
undecided | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the news held a forum to discuss who people would choose for some kind of position or role, but that there was a group of individuals who had not yet made a decision. This group would be called "undecided." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "reject" suggests a negative decision, "predetermination" suggests a decision already made, "force" is not related to decision-making, and "blank" is not commonly used to refer to people who have not made a choice.
shoebox | Knowledge: A shoebox is a container specifically designed to hold shoes, so it would be the most logical answer to the question. Keeping a shoe on your left foot or at a wedding are not relevant to the question. While a shoe could be kept in a closet or a house, those answers are too broad and do not specify a specific location within those spaces.
sock | Knowledge: This question is asking for the logical sequence of putting something on your foot. The most common item to put on your foot first before anything else is a sock, followed by a shoe. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Fungus is a type of infection that does not belong on your foot, and grave and table are not items that you would put on your foot.
dominated | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the discovery of horses by Native Americans had an impact on the plains landscape. The word "dominated" indicates that the Native Americans may have become more influential and powerful in their environment after acquiring horses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
adrenaline rush | Knowledge: Seeing the finish line in a race can often trigger an adrenaline rush, which is a surge of energy and excitement that can help the athlete push through and finish strong. This is a common experience for many athletes and is likely why the option "adrenaline rush" is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Russia | Knowledge: The sentence highlights that the factory produces specialized toys such as AK47's and MiGs, which are associated with the Russian military. This suggests that the factory is located in or associated with Russia, making "Russia" the correct answer. The other options, such as free trade zones, industrial park, napoleon, and workers, do not provide any context or connection to the mention of specialized Russian military toys.
produce fruit | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that farmers will plant an apple tree for a specific purpose. The option "produce fruit" is the most viable choice as apple trees are a known source of fruit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
strip mall | Knowledge: The term "steak house" typically refers to a restaurant that specializes in serving steak, which is a type of meat often associated with high-end dining. However, strip malls are known for having a variety of small storefronts that cater to a wide range of consumer needs, often including fast food and casual dining options. Therefore, it is unlikely that a strip mall would have more than one steak house, as it would not necessarily be the ideal location for this type of fine dining establishment to succeed. The other options are all locations where one might reasonably expect to find multiple steak houses, depending on the size of the city or the preferences of the local population.
emergency room | Knowledge: The word "urgent" suggests that the wound requires immediate attention, which is typically provided in an emergency room. A hospital or injured person could refer to a variety of medical situations, not just urgent wounds. "Hurt" is a vague term that does not provide any specific information about where to go for medical attention. "Battle" is not a medical location, but rather a description of a specific type of conflict.
cambodia | Knowledge: Mines and explosions are often associated with countries that have experienced or are still experiencing armed conflict, as landmines are frequently used as weapons. Cambodia is a country that has a history of conflict, including civil wars and the Cambodian genocide, which has resulted in a large number of unexploded landmines across the country. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hop | Knowledge: Frogs are known to move on land by hopping, which involves pushing off the ground with their back legs and landing on their front legs. Jumping several feet is unlikely since frogs are not capable of sustained flight. Swimming is how frogs move through water, not on land. Leaping is similar to jumping and also unlikely for a short distance. Walking is not a typical form of movement for frogs as their legs are adapted for jumping and hopping in water and on land.
congratulated | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person achieved a positive outcome and was recognized by their peers in response. The word "congratulated" suggests that they were praised or acknowledged for their achievement, which is a common response to success. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not relate to achievement or imply a negative reaction from others.
gear shift | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is an issue with the chain on Bill's bike, which is likely affecting the function of the bike. The gear shift is a crucial part of the bike that allows the rider to change gears and adjust their speed. If the chain keeps coming off, it's likely that the gear shift is not able to function properly, which would make it difficult to use. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
old enough | Knowledge: Admissions counselors are responsible for evaluating students' readiness for school based on a variety of factors, including age. Therefore, the answer is likely to be "old enough" as it pertains to the age requirements for starting school. The other options do not necessarily relate to the admissions process or age requirements for starting school.
eat bread | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker has successfully made a good loaf of bread, and the only thing left to do is to consume it. The other options are not relevant in this context.
get ready | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is preparing to leave for work, so "get ready" is the most appropriate choice. "Wake up" is too general and could refer to any time of day, "have job" is not an action someone does before leaving for work, "message the boss" is not a common task before leaving for work, and "take bus" may not apply to everyone, as some people might drive or walk to work.
look at things  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person dislikes visiting museums because of the stillness and the requirement of looking at things. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. Taking pictures, appreciation, crying or whispering do not necessarily require stillness, and may not be directly related to visiting museums.
western hemisphere | Knowledge: The Atlantic Ocean is located on the western side of the globe, so the correct choice will likely relate to the western hemisphere in some way. The other choices do not necessarily suggest a connection to the Atlantic Ocean.
getting acquainted | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to learn something about someone they are talking to. "Getting acquainted" refers to the process of becoming familiar with someone and learning about their background, interests, and personality. The other options are related to communication in general, but do not specifically refer to the act of learning about someone during a conversation.
happy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is having fun by doing a lot of planned activities, which is often associated with feeling happy and fulfilled. The other options do not accurately describe the context of the sentence. "Do like" and "do enjoy" are not commonly used phrases in English, "spontaneous" suggests the person is not planning activities, and "work less" is not related to the context of fun and planned activities.
punishment | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone may believe that killing is justified. The option "punishment" aligns with the concept of capital punishment or the death penalty, which is sometimes argued as a justifiable form of punishment for certain crimes. The other options are not in line with the context of the question.
jail time | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James committed a serious crime (stabbing someone to death) and will likely face legal consequences as a result. Given the severity of the crime, "jail time" is the most likely outcome. The other options do not provide a logical consequence of committing such a serious offence.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence implies that having a dry, clean floor is particularly crucial in one specific type of building. Restaurants are places where food is prepared and served, and any spills or wetness on the floor can pose a safety hazard for both employees and customers. In contrast, places like beds, synagogues, and weddings do not necessarily have the same level of risk associated with a wet or dirty floor. The option "all buildings" is too broad and generalizes the sentence's meaning.
being caught | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John needed to escape from something he was afraid of being caught by. The words "escape" and "scared" imply that there is some danger or threat he is trying to avoid. The use of the word "runt" may suggest that he is physically small or weak, which could make him more vulnerable to being caught. The other options also suggest some form of confinement or restriction, but they do not specifically imply that John is afraid of being caught.
exhilaration | Knowledge: James loves climbing, which suggests he enjoys the physical and mental challenge of ascending a height. The word "exhilaration" means excitement and pleasure, which is a common feeling associated with climbing and experiencing heights. The other options are less likely to be associated with positive emotions related to climbing. Exhaustion and falling down are negative outcomes that James would likely want to avoid, nervousness is a feeling of anxiety, and vertigo is a feeling of dizziness or disorientation.
dentist office | Knowledge: The word "drill" is commonly associated with dental procedures such as drilling a cavity or preparing a tooth for a filling or crown. These procedures are typically performed by a dentist in a dental office, not in a garage, army, basement, or repair shop. Therefore, the correct answer is "dentist office."
get money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you become an undercover shopper, your main goal is to perform a review of products you purchase. Getting paid for the review is a common practice in this field, so it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer is "get money." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
alley | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is using a trash can in the downtown district of a city, which implies that they may be in a densely populated area with buildings and businesses. When in the downtown district of a city, alleys are often used as service entrances for businesses and are commonly lined with dumpsters and trash cans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
find truth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the archaeologist was driven by a desire for knowledge or understanding, which is commonly associated with the pursuit of truth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Billy needs rest, which suggests that he's tired or stressed. The phrase "wanted to have rest" indicates that he wants to take a break and unwind. The option "relax" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly relates to the idea of taking a break and resting. The other options are either too specific or don't match the context of the sentence.
corner | Knowledge: A cube is a three-dimensional shape that has six faces, all of which are squares. It has eight corners, also called vertices, which are formed by the intersection of three edges. The sentence specifically mentions "top, bottom, and two sides," which leaves only one possibility for the missing component: a corner. The other options do not fit the characteristics of a cube.
stand erect | Knowledge: The word "authoritative" implies a sense of power or control. Standing erect, or standing tall with good posture, is often associated with confidence and assertiveness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of appearing authoritative.
full stomach | Knowledge: The phrase "make a pig of myself" suggests overeating or indulging in an excessive amount of food. Therefore, the most likely outcome would be a full stomach. The other options, such as gaining energy or feeling satisfied, do not align with the context of overindulging. Dieting, on the other hand, is the opposite of overeating and would therefore not be the correct answer.
healthy relationship | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that "every human wants with someone else," implying a positive and intimate connection between individuals. A healthy relationship fits this criteria and is a common desire among humans. The other options do not align with the context of the question and do not describe a desired connection between individuals.
afternoon | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weather was different from what was expected in the evening, which implies that the temperature changed during the day. The correct option would be the one that indicates a specific time of day when the temperature was not what was anticipated. The other options do not relate to the time of day, and the desert option may even suggest that the evening was still cold.
movie | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about an activity related to darkness. The only option that makes sense in this context is "movie," since many movie theaters offer snacks including ice cream and the theater is typically darkened during the film. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
irish bar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the harp is commonly played at a specific type of establishment. This is likely to be an Irish bar, as the harp is an important symbol of Irish culture and is often associated with traditional Irish music. Other options, such as a music shop or auditorium, are not specifically linked to the harp and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
united states | Knowledge: The question explicitly mentions fast food chains, which are commonly associated with the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to fast food chains. Additionally, visiting a county or a seaside does not necessarily guarantee an abundance of fast food options.
partner | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to someone they worked closely with during the dance competition. Praise for one's own moving abilities, happiness, or talent would not typically be phrased in this way, and sitting still is clearly not relevant to a dance competition. Therefore, it is most likely that the subject is praising their dance partner for their part in the victory.
weight loss | Knowledge: The sentence implies that eating healthier and exercising are likely to have a positive effect on one's physical health. Weight loss is often a desired outcome of these activities as they can help to burn calories and reduce body fat. Tiredness and sweat may be temporary side effects of exercising, but they do not necessarily indicate a positive outcome. Diet is also important for overall health, but it alone may not result in weight loss without exercise.
speak to god | Knowledge: The question implies that praying is possible even if someone is paralyzed, which means it does not require physical movement. Speaking to god is a common way of communicating with him during prayer, and this would not be impeded by paralysis. Going to church or kneeling both require physical movement, which would be difficult or impossible for someone who is paralyzed. Praise for god and sincere prayers are important components of prayer, but they do not specifically address the issue of paralysis.
personal | Knowledge: The question suggests that the object is not commonly found in a common room, which implies that it may have personal significance or be specific to an individual's taste. The other options do not necessarily imply a personal connection, e.g. rare or elite could refer to an expensive or exclusive object that is not commonly found, but it does not necessarily imply a personal connection.
front yard | Knowledge: Mailboxes are typically found in front yards where people receive their mail. Porches may sometimes have a mailbox, but not typically in such large numbers. Hardware stores and diners are unlikely places to find mailboxes, and downtown areas may have a few mailboxes, but not to the extent of "hundreds of thousands."
court house | Knowledge: A registry office typically deals with legal matters such as births, deaths, marriages and property. As such, it is likely that you would need to visit a court house, which is a government building where legal matters are handled, before entering a registry office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
chemistry lab  | Knowledge: Helium, magnesium, and sulfur are commonly used elements in chemistry experiments and are likely to be found in a chemistry laboratory. The other options such as atmosphere and air are not specific to a school setting, while supply closet and laboratory are too general and could apply to any type of school or workplace.
public building | Knowledge: The sentence specifies that James went into his office at "city hall," which is a public building used for government and administrative purposes. Skyscrapers and tall buildings can also be public buildings, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine if this is the case. "Work" and "a house" are too general and do not specify the type of building.
shelf | Knowledge: The question is asking where you would place a candle if you wanted it on a wall, suggesting that the candle needs to be in a position that is both secure and elevated. A shelf is a logical choice because it can hold the candle securely and is already attached to the wall, making it an easy and safe option. The other options (birthday cake, church, floor, and dark) do not make sense in the context of the question or would not provide a safe or practical location for a candle on a wall.
city | Knowledge: The question is asking for what a town is a subset of, and a city is a logical answer because cities are typically made up of smaller towns within their boundaries. Rural areas and countryside are more general terms that can encompass towns, cities, and other types of settlements. Train stations are specific locations within a town or city, but they do not define what a town is a part of. A state is a political boundary that a town may be located within, but it does not necessarily make up a part of a town.
tradesmen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a specific group of people came in to complete the flooring of the building. The term "tradesmen" generally refers to skilled workers who specialize in a particular trade or craft, such as flooring installation. The other options (builders, architect, target, tornado) do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the task of flooring installation.
east | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about the location of the Indian Ocean in relation to Africa. Looking at a map, we can see that the Indian Ocean is located on the eastern side of the African continent, with countries like Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique bordering it. The other choices do not provide any relevant information to help us determine the correct answer.
collaboration | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the group's ability to communicate well contributed to the quality of their work. Collaboration is a key component of successful teamwork, and effective communication is essential for collaboration to work. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - progress and static might refer to the group's work output, coup might suggest a sudden achievement or success, and confusion implies a lack of communication or understanding.
stand still | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is being asked what they will do if they don't turn and don't move. Of the given choices, standing still is the only action that fits this description. Twisting implies a change in direction, and going straight implies movement. Therefore, the correct answer is stand still.
town | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where millions of apartments can be found. The option "town" is the most likely choice as it is common to find a large number of apartments in urban areas with high population density. Michigan is a state and is not specific enough to determine the location of millions of apartments. "Inside the house" is not a location where millions of apartments would be found. "Avoid buying" and "budget" are not locations at all, but rather suggestions or considerations when looking for apartments.
distract police from a real crime or arm robbers (either answer could be correct depending on the context of the question) | Knowledge: Both of these answers could be considered illegal actions that guns can do. If the question is asking about illegal actions that are directly related to the use of a gun, arming robbers would be the correct answer as it is a direct violation of weapons laws. However, if the question is more broad and includes the potential consequences of gun use, distracting police from a real crime could also be considered illegal since it obstructs justice. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the potential illegalities of gun use.
organism | Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that applies to all living things that have at least one nerve. The term "organism" refers to any living thing, whether it's an animal, plant, or single-celled organism. The other options are not applicable to all living things as they refer to specific parts or features of the body, or a particular type of animal.
shake hands | Knowledge: When people meet for the first time in a professional or formal setting, it is common to perform a handshake. This gesture indicates a mutual respect and sets the tone for a positive interaction. The other options may also occur during a meeting, but the sentence specifically mentions "meeting" which suggests a greeting or introduction is taking place, making the handshake the most likely option.
telephone book | Knowledge: The question asks where one can look up a number to a business when there is no electricity. This suggests that the answer should not involve electronics or power, ruling out options like power grid and roulette wheel. An equation and math problem are not relevant to looking up phone numbers. A telephone book, however, is a printed directory of phone numbers, making it a reliable source of information when electricity is not available. Therefore, the correct answer is telephone book.
nose | Knowledge: The sentence states that cats are mammals, and it is common knowledge that all mammals smell with their nose. The other options do not have any direct correlation to the context of the sentence.
strong | Knowledge: The sentence implies that wrestling requires a certain level of physical strength. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "strong." Options such as "train yourself," "take lessons," and "choke hold" may relate to wrestling to some extent, but they don't clearly describe a trait that is commonly associated with people who wrestle. Similarly, while having strength may go hand in hand with wrestling, it doesn't necessarily imply that someone who wrestles is always very strong.
ignorant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while Billy had intelligence, he lacked experience in certain areas. "Ignorant" means lacking knowledge or experience in a particular subject, so it would be the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "garish" means overly colorful or flashy, "bright" is a synonym of intelligent rather than inexperienced, "make invisible" is not related to Billy's situation, and "backward" suggests a lack of intelligence rather than a lack of experience.
razor | Knowledge: In a barbershop, a razor is typically the most important tool a barber uses because it is what is used to actually cut the hair. While scissors are also important, they are typically used for more precise cuts and shaping rather than the initial cut. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not a tool used for cutting. The other options (commercial area and city) are completely unrelated to the context of the question.
freshwater lake | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the man loved to fish for bass, which are a type of freshwater fish. This suggests that the man would prefer to fish in a freshwater environment. The other options, such as river or live in ponds, may also offer freshwater environments but are not specific to the type of fish the man loves to catch. Additionally, the sentence suggests that the man needs a boat and equipment, which are typically used in larger bodies of water such as lakes. The option of sunshine or music store does not have any clear connection to fishing.
details | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is describing what makes a good movie and that they appreciate "little" things. This implies that they value attention to detail, which is important in creating a high-quality film. The other options, such as "mice," "go home," "witty," and "headache," do not make sense in the context of describing what makes a good movie.
People | Knowledge: The question is asking about who keeps their car in a parking area, which could refer to any group of individuals who own cars and need a place to park them. The other options are all specific locations where parking areas might be found, but they do not necessarily answer the question about who uses them.
corvette | Knowledge: The question is asking for a similarly powerful vessel but faster, which rules out options like patrol boats or yachts which are not designed for speed or strength. An aircraft carrier and a destroyer are both larger and more powerful than a battleship, with different functions and purposes. A corvette, on the other hand, is a smaller, swift military vessel designed for speed, agility, and firepower, making it a suitable option for someone looking for a faster alternative to a battleship.
beautiful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman had a positive emotional reaction to the music. Given that the other options have negative connotations (silent, irritate) or don't clearly reflect an emotional response (express emotion, quiet mind), the correct answer is likely to be "beautiful," which is a word commonly used to describe music that is pleasing or enjoyable to listen to.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the toilet was built into a suit used by zero gravity travelers, which implies that the travelers were in space. The context of the sentence implies that this was a particular type of vehicle or mode of transportation, which makes the options of aircraft, stadium, and restaurant less likely choices. The word "toilet" also suggests a limited range of options, and the presence of "shuttle" in the phrase "space shuttle" makes it the most logical choice.
nightmares | Knowledge: The other options in the list do not specifically indicate a problem with sleeping, whereas nightmares are commonly associated with disrupting sleep patterns. While being at a party or having fun might lead to a lack of sleep in some cases, these options are not specific enough to be the correct answer to this question. Death and relaxation may or may not have an impact on sleep, and would depend on the individual and their circumstances.
available | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah's wife wanted her to be more present and accessible, which is often conveyed through the term "available." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
coffin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family had a lot of love and affection for their pet dog, so it is likely that they would have given it a proper funeral or burial. The option "coffin" is the most appropriate choice for this, as it is a container used for laying a body to rest. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
breathe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question had lived a fulfilling life and was content at the end, implying that they had accomplished their goals and were at peace with their life. The phrase "died with no regrets" further emphasizes this idea. The last thing that the person did was to take their last breath, indicated by the phrase "as he took his last." The other options - reading a book, going to school, or embarking on a journey - do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the person's contentment or the idea of dying with no regrets.
ocean | Knowledge: The sentence establishes that a continent is a large area of land, but then contrasts this with what the globe is mostly covered by. The most common answer to this would be an ocean, as oceans cover roughly 71% of the Earth's surface. The other options, while all related to geography in some way, do not make sense in this context - for example, Australia is a continent but not the answer we're looking for here.
desirable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a home base when camping is important or beneficial. The word "base" implies a central location or starting point, and having a designated place to return to while camping can make the experience more comfortable and organized. The other options do not make sense in the context of camping or having a home base.
undergrowth | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fox ran into a forest and disappeared, suggesting that it was able to conceal itself among the plants and foliage. "Undergrowth" refers to the shrubs and small trees that grow beneath the larger trees in a forest, providing cover for animals like foxes. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to the landscape or the behavior of the fox.
cobbed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are different varieties of corn, and that Sam and June chose to buy loose corn because it was less expensive than another variety. The word "cobbed" refers to corn that has been removed from its cob and packaged, which makes it a likely candidate for the more expensive option. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rural area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John lives in a remote and isolated location where farming is no longer a prominent activity. This description matches the characteristics of a rural area, which is typically an area that is sparsely populated and dominated by agricultural or natural landscapes. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they either describe a specific type of building or location or do not meet the criteria of being remote and without farming activity.
become stronger | Knowledge: Exercise is commonly associated with building strength and improving overall physical fitness. The other options, such as tiredness, exhaustion, getting sick, or using energy, do not directly relate to the benefits of exercise. In fact, exercising can actually help combat fatigue and increase energy levels. Therefore, the most logical answer is that people participate in exercising to become stronger and healthier.
weigh | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercising for many months will cause a decrease in something, which is most likely a physical change in the body. The term "weigh" is the only option that specifically refers to a physical measurement of the body, while the other options have more general or nebulous meanings. "Stretch" and "work out" may actually increase rather than decrease with exercise, while "expend energy" and "blood" are not necessarily associated with a change in weight.
willing to help | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys giving assistance, which implies that they have a positive attitude towards helping others. "Willing to help" is the choice that best fits this description. "Helpful" and "prepared" are related to being able to give assistance, but do not necessarily imply enjoyment. "Help one" is grammatically incorrect, and "go home" is not related to giving assistance at all.
sharing of knowledge | Knowledge: The word "communication" implies the act of sharing or exchanging information or ideas between individuals or groups. The other choices such as "conductor" or "people to think" do not accurately reflect the motive behind communication. "Distributed information" could be another valid option, but "sharing of knowledge" implies a more active and intentional exchange of information rather than just passively disseminating it. "Confusion" is an opposite, and would not be a motive for communication but rather a potential negative consequence.
large home | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has saved up enough money to buy something significant. The mention of a dream entrance hall suggests that the purchase is related to a dwelling place and the use of the word "bought" indicates a purchase. "Hat rack" and "school" do not fit the context of purchasing a large home, while "palace" seems too grandiose for the given information. "Gateway" is also unlikely since it does not fit the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends gathered to engage in an enjoyable activity, which is commonly associated with playing cards. The phrase "have fun" is also often used in reference to social gatherings, which further supports this answer choice. The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence; for example, there is no indication that the friends were drinking alcohol or feeling bored.
integrate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is additional code from another team that Saul needs to incorporate into his own program. The word "integrate" specifically refers to the process of combining different pieces of code or software systems into one cohesive program. The other options do not relate to incorporating new code and would not make sense in this context.
lose money | Knowledge: The question is asking for a factor that could prevent someone from being able to buy a house. Losing money is a common reason for many people not being able to afford a home. This might be due to a job loss, unexpected expenses or debt payment obligations. Bargaining, paying for, settling down or distance do not seem to imply a lack of affordability for buying a house.
cook dinner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is hungry in the evening, which is typically a time when people eat dinner. The phrase "cook dinner" specifically refers to the action of preparing a meal at home, which is a common activity for people who are hungry in the evening. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to meals at different times of day or involve going outside of the house to eat.
cause bleeding | Knowledge: The word "messy" suggests that the injury can cause some sort of bodily fluid or substance to be present, which would be the case with bleeding. Infections and distress may not necessarily be messy, and while death may result from an injury, the term "messy" does not necessarily describe the outcome. "Hurts" is too general and could apply to any injury, but it does not necessarily imply messiness.
country club | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tennis players are professionals playing for money, which implies that they are likely playing at a location where they can earn a living from the sport. Country clubs are often associated with higher-end tennis facilities that attract professional and semi-professional players, while college campuses and health clubs are more likely to have recreational players. Wimbledon is a specific location and may not be the correct answer depending on the context of the question. Outside is too broad, as professionals could be playing anywhere outdoors.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that typing for a long time can be physically demanding and potentially harmful. Pain is a common signal from the body indicating that it is under stress or strain, and thus taking a break is necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also a potential health risk associated with typing and can cause pain, but it is a specific medical condition rather than a general sign one should take a break. Letter, thirst, and printed word are not related to the physical stress associated with typing.
countryside | Knowledge: Trees are often planted along rural roads, especially those located in the countryside, to provide shade and create a pleasing aesthetic. State parks and forests may also have trees lining the roads, but the context of the question implies a more common occurrence, which favors the countryside option. Gardens and yards may have trees, but they are not typically planted along roadsides.
frustration | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone is struggling to learn about science, which suggests that they may feel frustrated. Learning can be a difficult process, and science is a complex subject that requires a lot of effort and dedication to master. Smiling or becoming happy may be unlikely responses to struggling with science, while accidents and experimentation are not related to the emotional experience of learning.
pharmacy | Knowledge: When a doctor prescribes medication, it means they are recommending a specific type and dosage of medication for a patient's health condition. Antibiotics are a type of medication that can only be obtained with a prescription. Therefore, the patient would need to take the prescription to a pharmacy where a licensed pharmacist would dispense the medication. The other options do not accurately reflect the proper process of obtaining a prescription antibiotic.
stay awake | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is afraid of something that may harm him while he is sleeping, so he chooses to stay awake instead. The phrase "nothing can hurt you" implies that staying awake is seen as a way of protecting oneself from harm. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
sand pile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many grains of sand being referred to, which when put together, form something. The only option that matches this description is "sand pile." The other options, such as "eye," "bathing suit," "clam," and "create pearl," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
versailles | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John may be in a palace, which immediately rules out options such as a courtroom or office complex. The mention of a courtyard and a famous palace suggests that the location may be a historical landmark or tourist attraction. Spain, while it does have many famous palaces, is a broad option and therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Finally, the option "lawn" is clearly not the correct answer as it does not fit with the context of the sentence. This leaves "versailles" as the most likely option since it is known as a famous palace with a well-known courtyard.
live lives | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the topic is the entire life cycle of animals. The other options are only specific actions that animals may do during their lives, while "live lives" encompasses their entire existence. It is also a basic fact that animals are born and then live until they die, which further supports the correct answer.
shelf | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the employee was stocking a product, which typically involves placing it on a designated surface for customers to access. In a store setting, products are often stocked on shelves, making it the most likely option in this context. The other choices, such as display case and demonstration, do not fit the typical method of stocking a product in a retail setting. Market and store are too general and do not provide enough specific information to help make a choice.
racetrack | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a place where they can drive their car at high speeds. A racetrack is a common place for car racing or high-performance driving, where drivers can push their cars to their limits in a controlled environment. The other options do not provide a suitable location for high-speed driving. A garage or parking lot are confined spaces, while a freeway and side of the road have speed limits and regulations that prohibit reckless driving.
classroom | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place with a single ceiling that can also be located on the ground level. This rules out options such as airplanes, which have multiple levels and are not on the ground, and lofts, which are typically located aboveground. A house or building may have multiple ceilings, so those options can also be eliminated. A classroom, on the other hand, typically has a single ceiling and can be located on the ground level, making it the correct answer.
accidents | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a surprising event occurring while driving. One possible consequence is that it could lead to accidents, as unexpected events can cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles or collide with other cars. Fainting, being frightened or laughing do not seem to be appropriate responses to the situation, and "funny" is not a suitable answer in this context, as the question implies a potentially dangerous or serious scenario.
settlement | Knowledge: A tentative agreement usually means that parties involved have come to an understanding, but are not yet fully committed. A settlement, on the other hand, means that the agreement has been finalized and legally binding. The other choices, such as communication or celebration, do not necessarily indicate a finalized agreement. Parting ways also suggests that the negotiation did not reach a successful conclusion. Shaking hands may symbolize agreement, but it does not necessarily mean that a final decision has been reached.
feel sad | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting is associated with an emotional response, which is likely to be negative since the choices include "death," "punishment," and "accident." "More hurt" is also a possible response to hurting, but it is not a valid answer to the question because it is a physical response rather than an emotional one. "Feel sad" is the most appropriate answer because it aligns with the emotional connotations of the sentence.
expensive | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that diamonds have a high value because they are neither free nor cheap. The term "expensive" is commonly associated with objects that have a high monetary value. The other options, such as enslaved or imprisoned, do not make sense in the context of a discussion about the price of diamonds.
chopped | Knowledge: When making chicken salad, the chicken is typically cooked first and then chopped or shredded into smaller pieces before being mixed with the other ingredients. Baking, grilling, or buying pre-cooked chicken at the store would not necessarily result in the chicken being in smaller pieces. "Eaten" is not a method of preparing the chicken. Therefore, "chopped" is the most likely correct answer.
keep secret | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to keep a surprise party a surprise, one needs to do something specific. To keep a surprise party a surprise, one must keep the fact that there is a party a secret from the person who is being surprised. The other options are not related to keeping a surprise party a surprise in any way.
brains | Knowledge: The question is asking for a unique trait that humans possess in comparison to most other animals. While some animals may have certain similarities anatomically, such as having two legs or two feet, the defining characteristic that sets humans apart is their brain power. Humans have evolved to develop a highly complex, sophisticated brain that allows for advanced thinking, problem-solving, and communication. Therefore, "brains" is the correct answer that aligns with the context of the question.
rising interest rates | Knowledge: Inflation is often accompanied by rising prices, which can lead to an increase in interest rates. This is because the central bank may raise interest rates to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation. A higher interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, which can help to curb spending and reduce inflation. Therefore, being aware of rising interest rates is important when fighting inflation. The other options do not have a clear connection to inflation and loans.
south america | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scientist was searching for a specific type of bird, the endangered toucan, and that he was doing so in a forest. South America is known for its dense and diverse rainforest regions, which are home to many species of exotic animals, including toucans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
injuries | Knowledge: Playing football carelessly can lead to various injuries such as sprains, fractures, and concussions. Injuries are a common consequence of not taking safety precautions seriously while playing physical sports like football. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they describe positive outcomes of playing football, whereas the phrase "too carelessly" suggests a negative impact.
pet store | Knowledge: Pet stores are well-known for selling pets, including dogs, so this choice would make the most sense in the context of the question. The other options, such as outside, neighbor's house, park, and rug, do not provide any clear indication of where one would obtain a dog.
get paid | Knowledge: The most common reason for someone to try to cash in a check is to receive payment for work or services rendered. The other options, such as "extra money," "great joy," "quitting," or "profit," do not necessarily pertain to the act of cashing a check.
airport | Knowledge: Passengers who are planning to travel to another continent are most likely to be found at an airport. Airports are the main hubs for international travel, and are where travelers usually board planes to travel to other countries or continents. The other options are unlikely to have passengers traveling long distances, and are more commonly used for shorter journeys within a city or region.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to keep the antibiotic out of reach of children, implying that it should be stored in a secure location. A medicine cabinet is a common location for storing medications that need to be kept out of reach of children. Storing the antibiotic in the stomach or a capsule does not make sense as these are not storage locations, and being prescribed or coming from a pharmacy does not provide any information about where to store the medication.
rattle | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that when a can of spray paint is shaken, there is a sound or movement that occurs. The word "rattle" implies a shaking or clanking noise, which is a common characteristic of a can of spray paint being shaken. The other options do not accurately describe the expected result of shaking a can of spray paint.
recyclable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the symbol on the bottom of the glass bottle is related to its properties or intended use. The options "combustible," "dirty," and "very fragile" do not seem relevant in this context, while "clear" is a characteristic of glass that does not require a symbol to indicate it. Therefore, it is likely that the symbol indicates that the bottle can be recycled, which is a common practice for glass containers.
apartment | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that George is tired of his current living situation, which suggests that he is likely referring to his apartment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
eating | Knowledge: The question is asking about an action that is typically associated with having lunch. Eating is the most logical choice as it is the main activity that usually takes place during a meal. Hunger is a sensation that someone might experience before or after lunch, but it is not an action. Burping and laughing are unrelated to the act of having lunch, while food is a broad category that could refer to any aspect of a meal.
runway | Knowledge: When a plane reaches its destination, it must land on a runway. The runway is specifically designed for planes to take off and land safely. The other options do not make sense in the context of a plane reaching its destination. The plane may be in the air during flight, but it must eventually land on the runway. "Eat" and "fall" are not relevant to the question.
wilderness | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and are known to burrow in the ground or rocks. Therefore, the option "wilderness" seems like the most appropriate choice as it is a vast area of undeveloped land with diverse terrain and vegetation which can provide a suitable habitat for marmots to thrive. The other options such as "jungle" or "new zealand" do not align with the natural habitat of marmots.
make bread | Knowledge: The question is asking for a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger, which suggests that they may not have had access to a lot of money or resources. Making bread is a simple and inexpensive way to feed a family, as it only requires basic ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and salt. Going to the store, going to the market, or bringing home fish may not have been viable options for a medieval family depending on their location, income, and availability of resources. Eating a hamburger is not a plausible option because hamburgers did not exist during medieval times.
hollowness | Knowledge: Solidity refers to the state of being firm, stable, and strong. Hollowness, on the other hand, is the opposite, as it suggests that something is empty or lacking substance. The other options do not convey this sense of opposition to solidity, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Openness and fluidity suggest a lack of constraint, while weakness and instability suggest a vulnerability, which are not directly related to solidity.
box | Knowledge: Kleenex is a brand name of facial tissue typically used for wiping or blowing one's nose. While it is possible to carry individual tissues in a purse or pocket, the question specifically asks about where Kleenex is originally obtained from. The most common way to obtain Kleenex is by purchasing a box of tissues from a store or supermarket.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill struggles with riding his bike uphill, indicating that it requires a significant amount of physical exertion. The phrase "pushed himself to the point of" implies that Bill's physical activity was so strenuous that it caused him to experience a negative consequence. "Exhaustion" is the only choice that accurately reflects the consequences of over-exertion, while "falling down", "give up", "travelling", and "going somewhere" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The question suggests that the feeling one experiences after working hard to improve at chess and succeeding is related to a sense of achievement or fulfillment. The choice "satisfaction" best captures this idea. "Smart" may be a feeling one experiences after successfully solving a challenging problem or learning something new, but it is not necessarily the feeling associated with improving at chess. "Have fun" is not the most fitting choice as it does not reflect the idea of hard work paying off. "Made" is not a feeling, it is a verb. "Superior" is not the most fitting choice as it implies a sense of dominance or superiority over others, which may not be the case in this scenario.
guitar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the instrument in question is a popular one and usually has four strings. The options trumpet, kite, quark, and bird's nest are either not instruments or do not have the characteristic of having four strings. The guitar, on the other hand, is a popular instrument that typically has four strings, making it the correct answer.
own home | Knowledge: The options include different types of establishments, but the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to their personal oven. It is unlikely that a person would have access to an oven in a prison, school or restaurant setting, and while there may be ovens in pizza places, the most common place for an individual to have an oven is in their own home.
remorse | Knowledge: Killing someone is a serious act that often elicits strong emotions. While it is possible that someone may feel scared or worried about getting caught and going to jail, the term "remorse" specifically refers to a feeling of deep regret or guilt about a past action, which is more likely to apply to someone who has taken another person's life. The term "horrible" is also associated with negative emotions, but it is not specific enough to the context of the question. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotional response to killing someone.
injury |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing a potential outcome of competing against a fighter with better training. One logical outcome of facing such an opponent is that you might sustain an injury. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
suffering | Knowledge: The question is asking for the result or consequence of hurting someone else. "Suffering" is a logical choice because it describes the pain or distress that the person who was hurt is likely to experience. The other options do not adequately capture the consequence of causing harm to another person. "Punishment" and "arrested" may be consequences from a legal or social perspective, but they do not necessarily describe the emotional or physical result of being hurt. "Anger" and "hatred" may be emotions that the injured party may feel, but they do not describe the physical or emotional pain that results from being hurt.
oral report | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is standing in front of people while holding index cards. This is a common practice during giving an oral report or presentation. The use of index cards can help the speaker remember important points and stay organized while delivering a speech. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
military base | Knowledge: The word "bugle" is often associated with military and is typically used to signal specific events, such as reveille in the morning. In this context, the sentence suggests that a bugle sounded every morning at a location related to military operations or training. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context.
video game | Knowledge: The term "level up" is commonly associated with video games, where players progress through different levels of difficulty as they gain experience points. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of leveling up. A garage, food court, carpenter's shop, or building may have different purposes but do not relate to the gaming context.
water fountain | Knowledge: Birds typically clean themselves by bathing in water, either in natural bodies of water, such as rivers or ponds, or in man-made structures like bird baths or water fountains. The other options do not involve water or a place where birds could bathe. Nest is where they live, outside is too general, birdhouse is where they rest, and roof doesn't involve any water source for bird cleaning.
submachine gun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the player in the video game preferred to use the rocket launcher from a distance, indicating that the weapon was best suited for long-range combat. However, when the player was up close, they switched to a weapon with a fast firing rate, suggesting that they needed to take out enemies quickly. The assault rifle, submachine gun, and shotgun all have rapid fire capabilities, but the shotgun is typically used for close-range combat, making it an unlikely choice. The pistol and grenade launcher do not have the rapid firing capabilities suggested in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is submachine gun.
present bill | Knowledge: The question suggests that the waiter has already provided drinks, which is typically an early step in the dining experience. After providing drinks, the waiter's next action is often to present the bill so that the guests can pay and leave. The other options are less likely to follow immediately after providing drinks and do not fit the typical sequence of events in a dining experience.
landscape | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the angst filled teenager did not appreciate something that is related to rolling hills. The only option that seems related to rolling hills is landscape, which typically includes hills and other natural features. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
strong emotion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painting was created while the person was feeling angry, which is likely to have influenced the resulting artwork. Anger is a strong emotion, and it is likely that the painting conveyed this emotion inadvertently. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence - while creating art can be a work of art, a feeling of accomplishment or pleasure, these options do not connect with the fact that the creator was angry while making it. Making love is also a completely unrelated option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
congress | Knowledge: The sentence implies that passing a bill is a slow and tedious process, which is commonly associated with the US Congress. The US Congress is responsible for passing bills into law, and the process often involves long debates, negotiations, and revisions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
universe | Knowledge: The universe is the vast expanse of space that contains all matter, including stars, planets, and galaxies. It is unlikely that anyone could ever see all parts of the universe, let alone light within it. Therefore, the correct answer is universe. The other options all have surfaces or openings where light can enter, reflect, or emit, making them visible to the naked eye.
quark | Knowledge: Hadrons are composite particles made up of quarks held together by the strong force. This is a fundamental concept in the branch of physics known as particle physics, which includes string theory. The other choices have no connection to the concept of hadrons or particle physics.
ship goods | Knowledge: The question is asking for the most efficient way to sell things to customers. Shipping goods directly to customers is often the most efficient method as it eliminates the need for a physical store or additional branches, and allows for larger quantities of products to be transported at once. Owning a factory may be efficient for producing the products, but it does not necessarily mean that the company can efficiently sell them. Branching out may increase accessibility, but it may not necessarily be the most efficient option. Mail order requires customers to wait for the product to be delivered, which may not be the most efficient option for all customers.
opaque | Knowledge: The context suggests that the paint that Jim considered using would have covered up the natural beauty of the wood. This implies that the paint is not transparent and therefore, opaque would be the best answer. Opal refers to a type of gemstone and does not make sense in this context. Obscured and obscure mean to make unclear or difficult to understand, and thick does not necessarily imply that the paint would cover up the natural beauty of the wood.
civil | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that even though John disliked waiting in line, he still chose to do it anyway. The phrase "not breaking line" implies that John felt a sense of obligation to follow the rules and be considerate of others in the queue. Therefore, the correct choice would be something that relates to being polite or showing good manners, such as "civil". The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
become wet | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person was washing their hands, which implies that their hands became wet as a result. The other options do not make sense in the context of washing hands. "Jazz hands" is a type of dance move and has nothing to do with washing hands. "Health" is a broad and vague option that does not provide enough context to make sense as an answer choice. "Skin irritation" and "dry skin" may be possible outcomes of washing hands with harsh soaps or chemicals, but the sentence does not provide any indication that this is what happened.
contract | Knowledge: The sentence describes a muscle, and the word "stretched" implies that it was previously extended or lengthened. In this context, when a muscle "contracts," it means that it is shortening and tightening back up again. This is a normal and healthy response to stretching, as it helps to strengthen the muscle and improve its flexibility. The other options do not fit with what typically happens to a muscle after it has been stretched.
wrong | Knowledge: In this context, "fail after giving an answer" suggests that the person's answer was incorrect. "Wrong" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to giving an incorrect answer. "Problem" and "question" are too general and don't necessarily imply an incorrect answer. "Ask" and "swear" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drunk man was angry or frustrated, and he expressed this emotion by slamming a bottle down on something. The most logical option is the table, as it is a common object that can be found near someone who is drinking. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence; buying beer and getting a ticket are unrelated to the man's behavior, aim is not a tangible object, and breaking is a consequence of the man's action rather than the target of it.
mexico | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human wants to be in a warm place, which eliminates options like "in the fridge." The context of the question further suggests that the choice should be a location rather than a profession, which eliminates options like "doctor" and "workplace." The remaining option that fits the context is "mexico," as it is a country with a warm climate.
hair salon | Knowledge: Round brushes are commonly used in the hair salon industry for styling and blow-drying hair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of round brushes.
house clean | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the guest was asking the woman how she keeps her home in good condition. The answer given by the woman emphasizes the importance of not neglecting housework, which implies that her home is typically very clean. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence – feeling satisfied and boredom are emotions, while nice home and pristine house suggest a higher level of cleanliness than simply maintaining a clean house.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the exercise involved deep and slow breathing, which is a common technique used to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Other options, such as warm air, staying alive, or living, do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence. Calmness is a possible alternative, but relaxation is a more specific and commonly used term for the desired outcome of breathing exercises.
beef | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that chicken is not a popular option, so it's important to choose another form of nourishment that is likely to be more palatable. Of the options given, beef is the most likely to be a safe bet, as it is a commonly consumed source of protein and is often used as a substitute for chicken in dishes. Freezer, plate, and pizza are not sources of nourishment, and a fast food restaurant is not a specific type of food.
basket | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about something that can be used to carry a small dog, so options like swimming pool, dog show, backyard, and own home do not make logical sense. A basket, however, is often used to transport small animals, and would be a reasonable choice for carrying a small dog.
intangible | Knowledge: The word "corporeal" in the sentence means physical or tangible, so the evidence mentioned is something that can be touched or seen. The sentence also suggests that most of the evidence would not be useful, which implies that it might be intangible or not physically present. Therefore, the correct answer is "intangible," as it means something that cannot be touched or has no physical substance. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they refer to things that are not physical.
filing cabinet | Knowledge: The word "hanging" suggests that the files are being stored vertically rather than horizontally. The only option that allows for vertical storage is the filing cabinet. The other options - tree, suitcase, computer, and desk drawer - do not typically involve files being stored in a vertical position.
killing | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the man was caught stabbing his wife to death, which implies that he committed the act of killing. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the crime that the man committed.
ocean floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crab is a sea creature and that it uses camouflage tactics to catch prey. "Ocean floor" is the only option that relates to the habitat of sea creatures. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
destroy each other | Knowledge: The phrase "at war with one another" implies a violent conflict, which often leads to actions such as destruction and aggression. "Interact" and "talk to each other" are not likely scenarios in the context of war, as the parties involved are typically not in a position to negotiate or communicate effectively. "Run amok" is a vague term that does not provide enough context to indicate a logical consequence of war. "Desire to win" is a general statement that could apply to many situations, but it does not specifically address the consequences of war.
astounded | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the performance was impressive and had a strong impact on the people who witnessed it. The use of the word "eloquent" further indicates that the performance was characterized by a high level of skill and proficiency. The word "astounded" is the most appropriate choice for describing the reaction of the audience to such a performance, as it conveys a sense of awe and amazement. The other options do not convey the same level of impact or intensity that would be associated with a stunning performance.
frustration | Knowledge: The question is asking about problems specifically related to children learning about the world. Of the given choices, frustration seems to be the most related to this topic, as children may struggle to understand complex concepts or may find it difficult to process new information. Confusion, anger, and sadness may also be emotions that children experience while learning, but they do not necessarily pertain specifically to the process of learning about the world. Loss of innocence may be a theme in some cases, but it is not a direct problem that children face when learning about the world.
Italy | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John went to get an authentic pizza, which is a popular dish in Italy. Additionally, the mention of a terrace and balcony suggests a European-style building, which further supports the idea that John might be in Italy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the customer was looking for a larger selection or more options than what was available locally, and this implies that the customer was looking for a bigger selection offered in a more populous area. The urban connotation of "city" fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options have limited relevance to the context, as a dancehall and theater refer to specific types of buildings, a car dealership refers to a specific type of business, and Vegas, short for Las Vegas, would not be considered a local place for most people.
going to jail | Knowledge: Perjury is a serious crime that involves lying under oath in a legal setting. If someone is found guilty of committing perjury, they may face legal consequences such as fines, probation, or even imprisonment. Going to jail is a common punishment for this offense. Embarrassment and tension may also be feelings that someone experiences in relation to committing perjury, but they are not legal consequences. Mistrial is also not a direct consequence of perjury, but rather a legal decision to invalidate a trial due to some other issue. A lawyer is not a consequence, but rather someone who may be involved in defending or prosecuting a case involving perjury.
make up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple had a conflict or disagreement, but were able to move past it with a forgiving attitude. "Make up" is a common expression used to describe the act of resolving a disagreement and becoming friends again. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
become broken | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the warranty was purchased as a precautionary measure for fragile objects. Fragile objects are prone to breaking, and the purpose of a warranty is typically to provide coverage in case of damage or defects. Therefore, the correct answer is "become broken." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
growing older | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that wisdom is acquired over time, which implies that the person is aging and accumulating life experience. The phrase "as you live life" also supports this idea. The other options, such as toothsome and breathe, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
expression | Knowledge: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic expression, where dancers use their bodies to convey emotions, tell stories, and express themselves. Swan Lake is a famous ballet, but it is not a broader category that could be used to describe ballet dancing as a whole. Intercourse and fatigue have no connection to ballet dancing or artistic expression, and "become tired" is not a category that could be used to describe any form of dance.
upstairs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John heard a loud noise coming from below him, indicating that he is living in a multi-level building. The phrase "perfectly normal" suggests that the noise is a regular occurrence, and it happens at a specific time of the day. The phrase "he really hated living here" implies that John is not happy with his living situation. Based on these clues, the correct answer is "upstairs," as it is the only option that is related to living in a building with multiple levels. The other options do not make sense in this context.
car show | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are experiencing antique transportation as a form of entertainment. A car show is a popular event where antique cars are displayed and people can observe and interact with them. The other options do not have any clear connection to antique transportation, or are unlikely places where such an activity would take place.
playground or park | Knowledge: The options "gymnasium" and "bearing" are unlikely because they do not typically involve outdoor play. "Street" may have children playing, but it is not a designated area for children and is not very safe. "Playground" and "park" are both places designed for children to play and engage in physical activity, making them the most likely options.
beauty salon | Knowledge: Hair gel is commonly used in styling hair, and the profession of applying hair gel typically falls under the beauty or salon industry. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of professionals applying hair gel. A dressing room may be used for wardrobe changes, a perfumery typically sells fragrances rather than hair products, a bathroom is a common place to apply hair products but does not imply the presence of professionals, and while barbers also work with hair, they do not specialize in applying hair gel.
sweat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person takes competition seriously and works hard even when playing simple games. This implies that the person puts in physical effort and might sweat due to the exertion. The other options do not necessarily reflect physical exertion or hard work during competition.
call the police | Knowledge: When a child is missing, a parent's first course of action should be to contact law enforcement as soon as possible. Time is of the essence when it comes to finding missing children, so getting the police involved right away is crucial. While a parent may feel fear and worry in such a situation, that is not the action they would take to find their child. Homeschooling and closing a box are irrelevant and have no connection to the context of the question.
have fun | Knowledge: Playing games is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment, which is typically described as "having fun." While some games can be challenging or competitive, the primary purpose of playing games is usually to engage in an enjoyable activity. The option "bored" is listed twice, making it an unlikely correct answer as it does not offer any new information. "Win" and "challenge" may also be possible outcomes of playing games, but they do not capture the essence of the experience in the same way "having fun" does.
misunderstandings | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are not communicating or talking to each other, something negative happens. The word "misunderstandings" implies a lack of clear communication between individuals, which can lead to confusion and conflict. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the negative effects of a lack of communication.
Own home | Knowledge: A small dog is most likely a pet and would usually have a designated sleeping area within its owner's home. A backyard or garage may not provide adequate shelter or safety for a dog at night, and an animal shelter is not a suitable long-term option for a pet. A basket could be a good option, but it is not exclusive to dogs and may not provide enough warmth or comfort.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cost of beer is higher at a certain type of public event. Sporting events are known for having high prices on food and beverages due to demand and the captive audience. Refrigerator, drink, and fridge are irrelevant to the context of the sentence, while bowling alley could be a possibility but is not commonly associated with expensive beer prices.
interesting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing new people move in next door will elicit a certain response. The word "interesting" implies that there is a level of curiosity or intrigue involved. The other options may be possible, but do not capture the sense of curiosity suggested by the sentence. "New friends" assumes a positive outcome that may not always occur, "new experience" is too vague and could refer to any number of things, "look around" is not a response but rather an action that may occur as a result, and "change of surroundings" may not necessarily be interesting.
act of sex | Knowledge: Based on common knowledge and biology, it is known that two adults engage in sexual intercourse before the woman gives birth to a child. The other options do not accurately describe the process that leads to childbirth. "Loving couple" and "consent" may be necessary factors for healthy and consensual sexual intercourse, but they do not directly answer the question. "Birth" and "parents" refer to the end result and relationship status, respectively, rather than the action that precedes childbirth.
hurry along | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are busy, they tend to do something in response. "Hurry along" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of urgency and rapid movement, which is a common response to being busy. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of being busy. Making lists may be a response to being organized, but not necessarily busy. Trading places and talking to each other do not necessarily indicate a response to busyness. Saying "hello" to one another may indicate social interaction, but not necessarily a response to busyness.
staggering | Knowledge: The word "inebriated" is commonly used to describe the state of being drunk or intoxicated. People who are drunk often have difficulty maintaining their balance and walking in a straight line, leading to a staggering or swaying movement. Jumping and fighting are not necessarily associated with being drunk, and paralysis would make it impossible for the person to move at all.
shocking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Johnny's behavior after the original incident was not acceptable. The use of "completely" indicates that his actions were extreme. "Accidental" suggests that Johnny's behavior was unintentional, which contradicts the sentence's suggestion that his actions were a problem. "Detestable" suggests that Johnny's behavior was deliberately offensive, which could be a possibility, but there is no evidence to support this in the sentence. "Effusive" suggests that Johnny's behavior was excessively emotional, which does not fit the context. "Enabled" suggests that someone facilitated Johnny's behavior, which also does not fit the context. Therefore, "shocking" is the most appropriate answer.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence states that Mary is a high school student, which indicates that she is most likely attending classes in a school. The sentence also suggests that Mary was studying, which further supports the idea that she was in a classroom or library, both of which are common places for students to study. The other options, such as university, dinner, or every aspect of life, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
leave work | Knowledge: The sentence states that the woman had a busy schedule and needed to run errands and pick up her kids "the second she did" something. This implies that whatever she did would directly affect her ability to complete her tasks. Choosing "leave work" makes the most sense in this context, as leaving work would give her the time to run her errands and pick up her kids. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
a lot of noise | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the child's mother was told that she was distracting her downstairs neighbors, implying that the noise was the problem. Jumping up and down on the floor is likely to cause a lot of noise, which is why the mother was reprimanded. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not involve making loud noise.
panic  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person waited too long before starting work, which implies that they are now in a state of urgency, potentially experiencing stress or panic. Excitement and eagerness may be associated with starting work, but the phrase "waited too long" suggests a negative connotation, ruling those answers out. "Working" is a state of action, not a state of mind.
in Kentucky | Knowledge: Kentucky is known as the horse capital of the world and has a long history of breeding and raising high-quality horses. Many famous horse races, such as the Kentucky Derby, are held in Kentucky, and the state has a large number of horse farms and breeders. The other options do not have any clear connection to horse breeding or quality.
selling things | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was motivated by the desire to make money. One common way to achieve this goal is by selling goods or services. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
captivity | Knowledge: The phrase "out of its cage" suggests that the lizard is being kept in some kind of enclosure or captivity. The other options, such as Costa Rica or a river, do not relate to the concept of captivity or being in a cage. Encyclopedia and garden may be related to lizards but do not give information about the lizard's status.
bridge | Knowledge: Bridges are typically built on strong foundations that can support the weight of the structure and withstand the forces of nature. Foundations made of rock are often preferred because they provide stability and durability. Pillars may also be built on rock foundations, but they are typically smaller structures than bridges. Mountains and mountain ranges are natural features that are not built by humans, and the surface of the earth is too broad to be considered a foundation for a specific structure.
negative | Knowledge: When jumping a car, the positive terminal of a live battery is connected to the positive terminal of the dead battery, and then the negative terminal of the live battery is connected to a metal ground point on the dead car (such as a bolt or a metal surface). Therefore, after connecting the positive terminal, the next step is to connect the negative terminal. The term "negative" is also commonly used to refer to the negative terminal of a battery, making it a logical choice for the answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
emotional | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drama had a strong emotional impact on the humans who experienced it, which can be inferred from the phrase "highs and lows." This indicates that the humans were experiencing a range of emotions, which would make them emotional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tree | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a squirrel ran up to its home, which is most likely a tree. Therefore, it is likely that the small dog would be barking up a tree as it may have spotted the squirrel and is trying to catch its attention. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pantry | Knowledge: The word "dry" suggests that the items to be stored may be affected by moisture or humidity. A pantry is typically a cool, dry place designed for storing food items such as canned goods, cereal, and non-perishables. A storage closet may also be dry, but it's not typically associated with food storage. A building or warehouse may not have the right conditions for dry storage, and "inside" is too general and does not provide enough context.
cupboard | Knowledge: A cupboard is a type of storage unit often found in kitchens that typically contains plates, bowls, and other kitchenware. The fact that the bowl is "nestled among other bowls" suggests that it would be found in a storage area with other similar items, such as in a cupboard. The other options do not typically contain or store bowls in the kitchen.
agree or disagree | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people have differing opinions, which implies that they are in a position to agree or disagree with one another. Divorce, belief in God, and gaining weight do not have any logical connection to this context. Becoming angry is a possible emotional response, but it is not a direct action that people can take with one another.
smoothness | Knowledge: The word "grooming" suggests that the person is concerned with appearance and hygiene, which often involves smoothing out roughness in skin or hair. Therefore, someone obsessed with grooming is likely to enjoy smoothness. The other options are not necessarily related to grooming or appearance.
question authority | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the government was targeting people who were protesting, which typically involves speaking out against authority or challenging the status quo. This indicates that the government likely disliked people who questioned authority, making "question authority" the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
church | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Bill is most likely speaking in a religious setting, such as a church. The idea of giving money to someone in exchange for good things happening is often associated with religious practices, such as tithing. The other options, such as a stadium, hockey game, baseball game, or movie theater, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
getting divorce | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Joe wants to end his marriage to Jane, which suggests that they are discussing a divorce. The option "getting divorce" directly addresses this point and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, such as "pleasure" and "beatings," do not make sense in the context of this sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. "Heartache" and "heartbreak" could potentially make sense, but they do not directly address the specific action that Jane is accepting (i.e. a divorce).
wonder | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy enjoys learning and appreciating various subjects, but is not particularly skilled in one of them (art). When he visited the museum, he likely experienced a sense of wonder and amazement at the various works of art on display, even though he may not have felt creatively inspired to create his own art. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
use water | Knowledge: Water is an essential element when it comes to cleaning clothes. It is used to rinse out stains and dirt from fabric, especially when combined with detergent. While sorting may be helpful in organization, it is not a necessary step in cleaning clothes. Bleach is a type of cleaning agent that may be used in some cases, but not in all, and getting dirty is the opposite of cleaning. Laundering is the process of cleaning clothes, so it is not a necessary item you need in addition to water.
flat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the screwdriver was unexpectedly sharp, which may indicate that it was not designed to be sharp. The word "sharp" in this context typically refers to a point or edge that can pierce or cut through objects. In contrast, the word "flat" means lacking in sharpness, which could explain why the screwdriver's surprisingly sharp tip was unexpected. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
chesapeake bay | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the local government in question is located in the eastern U.S. and has a thriving crab fishing industry. Chesapeake Bay is well-known for its abundant blue crabs and is located on the eastern coast of the U.S. North Carolina is also located on the eastern coast, but there is no indication in the sentence that it has a significant crab fishing industry. Crab pots are a tool used in crab fishing, but they are not a governmental entity. Sandy beach and eastern coast are too broad and do not provide a specific location.
laundromat | Knowledge: The other options - wash clothes, cellar, house, and garage - all make sense as places where one might put a washing machine. However, a laundromat is a public place where people go to do their laundry, and each machine is typically shared by many people throughout the day. It would be odd for someone to put a personal washing machine in a laundromat since it is intended for individual use.
restaurant | Knowledge: The word "eat" implies that the chocolate cake is a food item meant for consumption. While it may be possible to eat a chocolate cake at home from a box, the other options (mouth, school, and supermarket) are not feasible locations to eat a chocolate cake. A restaurant is a likely choice because it is a place where food is served and eaten. Therefore, the correct answer is "restaurant."
being slapped | Knowledge: The phrase "unwanted flirting" suggests that the flirting is not welcome or appreciated by the recipient. In this context, the result of such behavior would likely be negative, such as causing problems or leading to a physical altercation like being slapped. The other options do not fit with the negative connotations of the phrase "unwanted flirting."
bad feelings | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the divorce between the two individuals resulted in negative emotions or a strained relationship, as evidenced by their lack of communication. While some of the other options may be a result of a divorce, the context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to the emotional effects of their separation.
cabinet | Knowledge: A cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, typically in a kitchen or dining area. It would be a logical place to put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon, as it could be kept out of the way and protected from spills or other accidents. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. A camelback is a type of hydration pack worn on the back, a cup and can are both used to drink from, and a backpack is for carrying items, not storing drinks.
reject | Knowledge: The sentence states that James decided not to accept temptation, which implies that he actively chose to resist it. The word "reject" is the only option that accurately reflects this action, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Predetermination" refers to something being decided beforehand, "undecided" means not having made a choice yet, "force" implies using physical or emotional pressure, and "concluded" means coming to a decision after consideration.
tropical areas | Knowledge: Monkeys are typically found in tropical areas, such as rainforests, where they live in the trees and forage for food. They are not typically found in school, research laboratories, or pet stores, as they are wild animals and not domesticated. While monkeys may appear in storybooks, this is not a reliable indicator of their real-life habitats.
tow truck | Knowledge: Attaching a chain to a car bumper is a common practice for tow trucks, which are used to transport vehicles that are unable to move on their own. The other options, such as obesity, bicycle, motorbike, and jewelry store, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cost money | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone might avoid getting a new car. One of the most common reasons for avoiding a new car is the expense. New cars are often more expensive than used cars and require more ongoing financial investment in terms of maintenance, repair costs, and insurance premiums. The other answer choices have no clear connection to the context of the question.
process information | Knowledge: Generally, computers are known for their ability to process and manipulate large amounts of data, making them useful in a variety of contexts. While some advanced systems may be capable of more complex tasks such as decision-making, the primary function of most computers is to process information quickly and accurately. The other options, such as thinking or making decisions, are typically associated with human intelligence and are not capabilities typically associated with computers.
were hungry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating only ice cream is not a healthy choice when one is hungry. This implies that there are healthier food options available when one is hungry. The other options like being depressed, cooling down or letting the ice cream melt in the mouth do not have any clear relation to the context of the sentence. The option of exercising may be a healthy choice but it is not suggested as an alternative in the sentence.
anxiety | Knowledge: The use of the word "unprepared" suggests that the person taking the final exams is not ready for the test. This could lead to feelings of stress, nervousness, and anxiety. Graduation and graduating are not relevant because they suggest a task that has already been completed (not something that is about to be undertaken). Happy is not relevant because the sentence is discussing a negative emotion, and headaches may be a side effect of stress but are not the main focus of this sentence.
dry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the champagne had a sweet taste as well as another quality that is complementary to sweetness. The opposite of sweet is often considered to be sour, bitter, or spicy, which do not fit with the context of the sentence. Decaying is not a taste, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Dryness is often used to describe the taste of champagne and is a common characteristic of high-quality sparkling wines. Therefore, dry is the correct answer.
bottle | Knowledge: Bottles typically have a narrower neck and wider body, making it necessary to hold them by the neck to ensure a firm grip. Holding a glass by the neck doesn't make much sense, as glasses are typically wider at the base, and holding them by the neck would result in an unstable grip. "Shoulder" and "body" are not descriptors of a type of drink, and "guillotine" is not related to drinks at all, so the correct answer is "bottle".
mulberry bush | Knowledge: The mulberry bush is a common place referenced in the classic nursery rhyme "Pop Goes the Weasel," suggesting that it would be a good place for a weasel to hide. The other options do not have any clear connections to weasels or their behavior.
name | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that every person has that not every wolf has. The answer is likely to be a trait or characteristic that distinguishes humans from wolves. Out of the choices given, only "name" fits this criteria as wolves do not typically have names, while humans are commonly given names. The other choices, such as "human intelligence," "hide," "mouth," and "heart" may be traits that both humans and wolves have in common.
write code | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed a computer program to complete a task, and he had the knowledge of how to make it. Therefore, he would logically start to write code in order to create the program. Debugging comes after writing code and refers to the process of finding and fixing errors in the code. Getting frustrated or damaging the computer are unlikely actions one would take in this situation. Compiling is the process of turning code into a program, but it is done after writing and debugging the code.
form friendships | Knowledge: The word "convivial" suggests a friendly and sociable atmosphere, which is conducive to forming new connections and relationships. When people are in a convivial setting, they tend to be open and receptive to meeting new people, which can lead to the formation of friendships. The other choices (expect miracles, think of life, talk to each other, arguments) do not necessarily pertain to the context of the sentence, and do not align with the expectation of a convivial setting.
relaxation or renewal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking a break affects work in a particular way. Based on this, relaxation and renewal are the most likely options, as they both denote positive outcomes of taking a break. "Distractions" and "delay" suggest negative impacts, while "snoring" is not related to the context at all.
soda | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer should be something that is commonly consumed with drinks. While a show, bar, dinner, and refrigerator may be associated with drinks in certain situations, soda is a classic beverage that is often served alongside alcoholic drinks or other types of beverages. It is also a common option for people who want a non-alcoholic drink to accompany their meal or snack.
america | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the fast food restaurant is present in multiple locations across a wide area. The option "america" is the most fitting answer as it encompasses anywhere in the United States where the restaurant may have a presence. The other options such as "big cities", "center of town" or "Los Angeles" are too specific and do not cover the entirety of the restaurant's potential locations.
interests | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob has a variety of hobbies or activities that he enjoys, as evidenced by his interest in both geology and waterskiing. The word "interests" is the most appropriate choice to describe this, as it refers to the things that someone enjoys doing in their free time. The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence.
flat ground | Knowledge: The keyword "slope" suggests that the answer should be the opposite of something that is sloped or inclined. "Flat ground" is the only option that fits this description, as it indicates a surface that is level and without any significant changes in elevation. The other options either imply a decline or an incline, which contradicts the meaning of the keyword in the question.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the referee is skilled in refereeing various games and has been offered a job that he is unsure of. The fact that the job offer doesn't specify a particular game suggests that it could be a position in a general sporting event. The options related to specific games such as football, hockey or boxing are not supported by the given information. The choice "side with opponent" is contradictory to a referee's role and doesn't make sense in the context.
nausea | Knowledge: The question asks about short term effects of eating hamburgers in excess, which suggests that the answer should be a relatively immediate consequence. While gaining weight and health problems can be long term consequences of consuming too many hamburgers, nausea is a common side effect of overeating or eating greasy or heavy foods. Death and tomato are not logical options for this question.
clean room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends have commented on the condition of the person's living space, indicating that it may be messy or cluttered. In this situation, it would be appropriate to clean the room in order to address the issue that has been pointed out by the friends. The other options do not provide a solution to the problem.
child's hand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small ball is being bounced by someone or something, and one of the options refers to a "child's hand," which is a common place for a child to hold and bounce a small ball. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a soccer game involves a larger ball, the street and sidewalk may refer to bouncing a ball, but not specifically a small one, and a toy store is not a likely place for a ball to be bounced.
European city | Knowledge: Ring roads are commonly used in European cities to help ease traffic congestion by providing a bypass around the city center. While other options may have freeway systems or cars, there is no indication that these factors would necessarily lead to the use of a ring road.
school | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location where one gains knowledge is relevant to the answer. The options "apartment", "house", and "table" do not indicate a specific context for learning. However, "school" is a common location where people use computers to gain knowledge through research, studying, and online classes. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "school".
movement | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is something that occurs between two points, which implies some sort of action or motion. The other choices do not accurately describe what passes between two points in space or time. "Relaxation" and "uneasiness" are emotions and cannot physically pass between two points, while an "obstacle" would impede or block movement and "elapsed time" is a measure of time, not a physical entity that passes between two points.
bed | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common hiding place for young boys to keep dirty magazines, which implies that the material is likely inappropriate or taboo. The bed is a common hiding place for personal items, such as magazines, because it provides privacy and can be easily accessed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
restaurant | Knowledge: A cup is a common item that is typically used to serve a beverage, such as coffee or tea. Restaurants are places where people often gather to have a meal and drinks, so it is likely that someone would bring you a cup at a restaurant. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fridge | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about hanging notes in the kitchen, which suggests that the notes are likely related to grocery lists, reminders, or messages for family members. The fridge is a common location for hanging such notes as it is a central and easily accessible spot in the kitchen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
suck blood | Knowledge: Fleas are known for feeding on the blood of their hosts, which is likely the cause of the dog itching. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of fleas. Biting and attacking may be related to flea behavior in some way, but sucking blood is the most accurate answer based on the information given in the sentence. Jumping and laying eggs are also behaviors associated with fleas, but they are not directly related to why the dog is itching.
large city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the buildings were designed to accommodate a large number of people, which is characteristic of urban areas where population density is high. Large cities are typically designed to have a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, in order to support the needs of a large population. University and town are not likely to have the same level of infrastructure or population as a city, while in a hole and small are not feasible options for the construction of such buildings.
breathe | Knowledge: Breathing is a necessary function for all living beings, and it is essential for sustaining life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Learning and marriage may enhance one's life, but they are not essential for survival. Sorrow is a negative emotion and cannot be considered a requirement for living life. Wear a mullet is a nonsensical option and has no relevance to the question.
object | Knowledge: The use of the word "shapes" in the sentence suggests that the geometry teacher is discussing various geometric figures. The term "object" is the most general of the choices and could encompass any kind of three-dimensional shape. The other choices are more specific and may not be relevant to the context of the sentence.
get full | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you eat a very big hamburger, you will experience a certain outcome. One likely outcome is that you will feel full, since the hamburger is likely to fill up your stomach. The other options do not make logical sense or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
understand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker knows the answer to a question or problem, but they do not know what to do with it. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this feeling of uncertainty or confusion. Among the given choices, "understand" is the most appropriate answer because it implies that the speaker has grasped the meaning or solution to the problem, but needs more information or guidance on how to act on it. The other options are either irrelevant or inconsistent with the context of the sentence.
backache | Knowledge: The question asks what physical condition a driver could have that would make them not want to drive their car. A backache is a common physical ailment that can make it uncomfortable or painful to sit for prolonged periods of time, such as when driving a car. The other options, such as car crashes, splinters, automobile accidents, and smoke, are not related to a physical condition that would specifically affect a driver's ability or desire to drive.
direct traffic | Knowledge: The use of a flashlight by a policeman in the street typically indicates that they are trying to direct traffic. This is often done during busy periods, accidents or when there is a breakdown in the usual traffic flow. The other options such as jumping, arresting criminals, or booking robbers do not make sense in this context.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist was worried about his possessions and cleaning up, which indicates that the party took place in their own residence. Home is the only option that could reasonably explain why someone would be concerned about cleaning up and keeping an eye on their belongings during a party. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
farmers market | Knowledge: A farmers market is a location where farmers and other vendors sell fresh produce directly to consumers. It is likely that the freshest apples would be found at a farmers market because they are sold directly from the farm to the consumer without any storage or transportation in between. The other options, such as a grocery store or fridge, may not have as fresh of produce as they may have been stored or transported for longer periods of time.
laughter | Knowledge: The word "outward" suggests that the answer is related to something that can be seen or heard. "Happiness" is also a clue that the answer is related to a positive emotion. Laughter is a common expression of joy and happiness, and is often easily recognizable and audible. "Love" and "tears" could also be outward expressions of happiness, but they are not as commonly associated with happiness as laughter. "Spread" and "limp" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
economic boom | Knowledge: When people are constantly buying products, it means that there is a high demand for the manufacturer's goods, which can lead to an economic boom. This is because the company is making more sales and generating more revenue, which can result in increased profits and growth for the business. The other options do not accurately reflect the positive impact that a high demand can have on a manufacturing company.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a grant was used to fund the renovation, but it does not mention any specific organization or entity. However, the fact that a fountain was the centerpiece of the renovation and it was located in a public place implies that it was likely funded by a local government or municipality, such as a city government. The other options, such as a state, a casino, or Rome, are less likely to be the correct answer as they do not fit the context of the sentence.
closed container | Knowledge: Bottles of glue are typically stored in closed containers to prevent them from drying out or spilling. The art room may be a likely place for glue to be stored, but it would still be kept in a closed container. The garage or kitchen would not be likely places for storing glue, as they are not typically associated with arts and crafts. A cabinet could potentially be used to store glue, but it would still need to be closed to prevent spills or drying out.
death or injury | Knowledge: Getting hit by a vehicle while crossing the street can result in serious injury or even death, making those two choices the most likely correct answers. "Traffic jam" and "accidents" are not likely results of an individual getting hit by a vehicle, as these terms suggest broader, less direct impacts of the incident. "Fear" is also not a likely result, as fear is a feeling experienced by individuals in response to a situation, rather than an outcome of that situation itself.
arrest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police have a specific job that involves not showing any favors. The option "arrest" is the most logical choice because it is a fundamental duty of the police force to enforce the law and make arrests when necessary. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. For example, "board vessels" may be related to coast guard or navy, but it is not related to the context of the sentence.
herpes | Knowledge: Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be spread through kissing, which is why someone may avoid it if they are worried about getting infected or if they have an active outbreak of herpes. Arousal and strong feelings may actually make someone more likely to want to kiss, while confusion is not likely to be a factor in this context. Shortness of breath could potentially be a reason someone avoids kissing, but it is not as directly related to the spread of herpes as the infection itself.
controversy | Knowledge: The question asks about the potential consequences of judging something wrong, and controversy is a logical answer as it suggests that disagreements and debates may arise from differing opinions on what is right or wrong. Eating cake and going to jail are not relevant responses to the question, and while responsibility and resentment may be potential consequences of judging something wrong, they do not capture the full range of possible outcomes as effectively as controversy.
excitement | Knowledge: The question is asking about the emotions that someone is likely to feel on their first day of work. While it's possible that some people might feel panic or stress, it's more common for people to feel excited about the new opportunity. Starting a new job can be an exciting time, and people may feel optimistic about the potential for growth and learning in their new role. The other answer options don't reflect the typical emotional response to starting a new job.
criminal prosecution  | Knowledge: Perjury is the act of lying under oath and is considered a serious offense in the legal system. Therefore, the judge may declare criminal prosecution as an appropriate action against the person who is committing perjury. Mistrial refers to ending a trial prematurely due to an error or problem, and citation refers to a legal notice or summons. Injustices and penalty are not directly related to the action of committing perjury.
pay attention | Knowledge: The word "loquacious" means someone who talks a lot or talks excessively. The sentence suggests that this man needs to listen more, which means he needs to stop talking and focus on what others are saying. "Pay attention" is the best choice because it implies active listening and engagement with the speaker, whereas "able to hear" and "concentrate" are irrelevant to the context of the sentence. "Shut up" is a rude and unprofessional way of telling someone to stop talking, and is not a suitable option for this situation.
having fun | Knowledge: While people may want to read fiction books for a variety of reasons, such as to learn new things or concepts, the most commonly cited reason is to have fun. Fiction books often provide an escape from reality and allow readers to immerse themselves in imaginative worlds and characters, providing entertainment and enjoyment. While some people may read to fall asleep or to memorize information, these are not typically the primary reasons why people choose to read fiction.
multiplied | Knowledge: When you multiply a positive integer by another positive integer, the resulting number will be orders of magnitude larger than the original number. This is because each additional digit increases the magnitude of the number by a factor of 10. The other options do not involve any mathematical operations that would increase the magnitude of a number, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
save money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shrewd investor had a plan to counteract inflation. Inflation is when the prices of goods and services increase over time, resulting in the decreased purchasing power of money. To fight inflation, one could either increase their income or decrease their expenses. The option "print money" would only worsen inflation, as it increases the money supply and decreases the value of each unit of currency. Lowering the standard of living and paying less are both strategies to decrease expenses, but they do not involve saving money. Saving money is a common strategy to increase one's purchasing power and protect against inflation. "More money" is too vague and does not provide any concrete plan or strategy.
fees | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the college attended by the students is expensive, which suggests that the cost of attendance is a concern for parents. As paying for expensive education can be a financial burden for families, they are likely to worry about the fees associated with attending such a school. The other options do not directly relate to the context of the sentence, except for dropping out, which could also be a concern for parents. However, it is not specific to attending an expensive school.
smile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the girl's feelings towards the boy were evident in her behavior. One common way that people physically show interest or attraction towards someone is by smiling, which is likely why the sentence states that she had a constant smile. The other options (make eye contact, listening, compliment, another person) do not necessarily indicate interest or attraction towards the boy, and therefore are not the correct answer.
joining | Knowledge: The word "stitches" suggests that the doctor was sewing something together, which would be the sides of the cut in this case. "Joining" and "putting together" both have a similar meaning to sewing or stitching. "Paste" could refer to a topical treatment, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Heal" is the ultimate result of the doctor's actions, but it does not describe what the doctor actually did.
die | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Luke, like all humans, is mortal and will eventually die. Therefore, the correct answer is "die," as this is the only choice that makes sense in the context of the sentence. The other choices, such as "ocean," "write," "smile," and "think critically," do not have any clear connection to the idea of mortality and self-preservation.
perfect world | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in a perfect world, every person would get along. "Perfect world" is a commonly used phrase to describe an ideal society where everything is ideal and everyone is happy. The other options are not related to the concept of a perfect world or getting along with others.
accident | Knowledge: The word "injury" suggests that the question is asking about a harm that comes to a person's body. The word "common" implies that the cause is something that occurs frequently. Accidents are a common cause of injury because they can happen in many different situations, such as car crashes, falls, and sports injuries. The other options do not have the same association with injuries.
annoyance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone keeps talking to multiple people about their vegetarianism, there might be negative consequences. "Annoyance" is the most fitting choice since the continuous talking about vegetarianism can become tedious and irritating to others. The other options do not seem to relate to the context of the sentence.
pantry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabinets were imported because they were cheap, and that they wouldn't be seen, which implies that they were meant for a storage space rather than a visible area like a kitchen or bathroom. A pantry is a place where people store food and other household items, and it is not a high-traffic area of the house, so it makes sense that someone might choose to install cheaper and less attractive cabinets there. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, either because they are visible areas (kitchen and bathroom) or because they do not make sense in the context (planes and Mexico).
chemotherapy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the joke made by the comedian was related to bald eagles and a specific treatment that may have caused them to become bald. Chemotherapy is a medical treatment commonly associated with hair loss, which may explain why it was mentioned in the same sentence as the joke about bald eagles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ignition switch | Knowledge: The ignition switch is where the car key is inserted to start the engine and begin driving. The other options, such as pocket, purse, and home, are not relevant to the context of the question and would not be where one would typically place car keys when preparing to drive. The trunk is also an incorrect option as keys are not typically stored in the trunk of a car for driving purposes.
not work so hard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that going outside to skate is a better alternative to doing something else. The other answer choices, such as putting on a helmet or singing, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Falling down" is also not a logical alternative to doing something else, but a potential consequence of skating. Therefore, the correct answer must be "not work so hard," as it is the only opposing option that suggests a different activity that is more enjoyable than working.
ground | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that seeing something dirty underground requires a specific object. The word "underground" is the main clue that points to the correct answer. To see something underground, you would need to look at or into the ground, which is the only option related to the context of the sentence. The other options (bed, bright, clean, and sportsmanlike) are unrelated to the context of the sentence and would not help in seeing something dirty underground.
train station | Knowledge: Train stations often have free magazines or newspapers available for commuters to read while waiting for their train. It is not uncommon for these publications to be provided free of charge as a courtesy to passengers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
vocation | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "chosen what" indicates that the correct answer will be a career or profession that someone actively pursues or chooses for themselves. The use of the word "success" suggests that this career or profession may involve achieving certain goals, milestones, or accomplishments. Out of the given choices, only "vocation" fits this criteria, as it refers to a person's life/career calling or purpose. The other choices are either too specific (new job, awards ceremony) or unrelated (schedule, Michigan) to the context of the sentence.
leave open | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the cover was causing some sort of problem or inconvenience for the diners, so they decided to do something about it. The most logical option would be to leave it open or remove it entirely. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "underneath" and "opening" are not actions that can be taken with a cover, "divert suspicion" is irrelevant and doesn't make sense, and "landcover" is not a common term associated with covers in this context.
downtown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the high rise is located in a central and busy part of a city. The option "downtown" is the most likely answer, as it refers to the commercial and business hub of a city where high-rise buildings are commonly found. The other options are either too specific (e.g., San Francisco, Detroit) or not relevant to the context of a high-rise building.
loading dock | Knowledge: The context suggests that the forklift would be used in a place where cargo trucks come and go frequently, which is usually at the loading dock of a warehouse or a distribution center. A loading dock is a designated area where goods are loaded and unloaded from trucks, so it is where the forklift would be most useful. The other options such as construction sites or yards may also use forklifts, but they are not as likely to have a high volume of cargo trucks coming and going.
bus depot | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the passenger is waiting for a ride, which points to the bus depot as the correct answer. A bus depot is a place where buses stop to let passengers on and off, and it is common for people to wait there for their transportation. The other options (shop, work, rack, and newsstand) do not typically involve waiting for a ride, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
heartburn | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating lunch too quickly. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be caused by eating too quickly and not chewing food properly. Sickness, low blood sugar, and obesity are not necessarily associated with eating too quickly, and spending money would not be a direct consequence of eating too quickly.
get cold | Knowledge: The phrase "If the weather means you..." implies that the weather has a certain effect on the subject being discussed, and the answer choice "get cold" makes logical sense in this context. Animals are often affected by changes in temperature, and if the weather is cold, it makes sense that the animals would also get cold. The other options are not necessarily related to weather or animals.
friend's house | Knowledge: The word "gossip" implies a casual and social setting where people are talking about personal matters. Sitting at a desk or in an auditorium does not fit this context. A synagogue is a religious place and not necessarily a place for gossip. The ocean is unrelated to the context of the question. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a friend's house, which is a common place for casual conversations and gossip.
fountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker filled something with water and plugged it in, which indicates that it is an electronic device. The use of the word "centerpiece" suggests that it is a decorative object that holds a prominent place in the garden. A fountain fits these criteria as it is a water feature that is often used as a decorative centerpiece in gardens. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly associated with gardens or decorative centerpieces.
car | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer must be a location or object where a single air conditioner could be found. Therefore, options such as "house", "hard", and "Texas" are not specific enough to provide a clear answer. Additionally, the option "in a bike" is unlikely since bicycles generally do not have air conditioning units. Therefore, the best option is a car, as it is a common location for a single air conditioner unit in order to keep the passengers cool while driving.
cd players | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the product mentioned uses a laser to produce sound. CD players use lasers to read the data stored on a disc and convert it into audio. Physics labs may use lasers for experiments, but this is not specific to sound production. Laboratories, bombs, and hospitals do not typically use lasers for sound production.
composed | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the music was very dear to the person, which suggests that they were involved in its creation. The phrase "during an important time in his life" implies that the person had a significant personal connection to the music, which further supports the idea that they were the composer. The options of night club and stolen do not fit with the context of the sentence and dreamt and written on paper do not provide enough information to support a correct answer.
blisters | Knowledge: The question suggests that the activity of dancing or walking can cause a physical problem on the feet. Fatigue and exhaustion are related to muscle tiredness and overall exhaustion, while humiliation is related to social embarrassment rather than a physical symptom. Skin is too broad of a term, and not specific enough to indicate a foot problem. Blisters, however, are a common problem that can occur on the feet from too much friction or pressure, making them the most likely correct answer.
literate | Knowledge: Literacy refers to the ability to read and write, which is the context of the sentence. While being literate may be associated with intelligence or having access to education (which could be connected with being smart or having paper), the most direct connection to the sentence is that literacy is the ability to read and write. The other options may not be incorrect, but they are not the most precise match for the question.
go outside | Knowledge: The first part of the sentence establishes the topic of responsible dog ownership, and the following sentence suggests a way to avoid overpopulation of dogs. The last part of the sentence is describing something else that dogs do, and "go outside" is the option that makes the most sense in this context. Dogs need to go outside for exercise and to relieve themselves, which is a basic aspect of being a responsible pet owner. The other options are either incorrect or not directly related to responsible dog ownership.
betrayal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a friend has taken advantage of you by stealing after cashing in chips at a casino. This would likely lead to feelings of betrayal, as you had trusted your friend but they violated that trust. Resentment and depression are also possible emotional responses, but betrayal is the most likely fit based on the context. "Leave" and "profit" are not relevant options, as they do not reflect the negative impact of being robbed by a friend.
theater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people took their seats and read their programs, which is commonly associated with a theater performance. It also mentions that they were expecting to enjoy an entertaining night, which is another clue that points to theater as the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mouth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while toothpaste is commonly found in the bathroom and may be stored in a traveling case or suitcase, it is not meant to be consumed. The context of the sentence implies that the word being sought refers to a part of the body, and the only option that fits that description is "mouth."
mulberry bush | Knowledge: The phrase "go round and round" suggests that the weasel is moving in circles around something. In this case, the weasel is waiting to attack, so it is likely circling its prey. Out of the options given, only the mulberry bush is commonly associated with the children's rhyme "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush," which includes the phrase "the monkey chased the weasel." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
It is impossible to determine where John might be working based on the information given in the sentence.
speed up | Knowledge: Airplanes need to gain speed in order to take off, which is why they typically accelerate down the runway during this phase of flight. The other options are not accurate descriptions of what airplanes do during takeoff.
fight for freedom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy joined the military for a specific reason. The phrase "fight for freedom" is commonly associated with military service, as soldiers often go to war to protect their country's freedoms and liberties. The other options do not make sense in this context. For example, getting married is not typically a reason to join the military, and waiting for orders is something that soldiers do after they have already joined.
death | Knowledge: The phrase "last passing sentence" suggests an end to someone's life. The word "passing" is often used as a euphemism for death, while "last" implies that this sentence is final, indicating that the person has died. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to death or the end of life. "Bounding" could refer to jumping or moving quickly, while "grief" is a feeling of intense sadness, "judgment" refers to decision-making or legal processes, and "appeals" are requests for a decision to be reviewed.
bridge | Knowledge: The word "bum" is often used as a derogatory term for someone who is homeless or unemployed. The context of the sentence implies that this person does not have money, and wants to travel without paying. A bridge is a common place for homeless individuals to sleep or stay temporarily, and it is unlikely that there would be any resources available to collect fare for transportation. The other options, such as a bus depot, train station, or even a taxi, would likely require payment for services rendered. The beach also does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dwarf | Knowledge: The word "massive" implies that the mountain is very large and imposing in size, which suggests that it would make the nearby hills seem small by comparison. The word "dwarf" means to make seem small or insignificant, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options are all antonyms of massive and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
stage | Knowledge: The word "audience" suggests that the musician is performing in front of a group of people, and the phrase "single musician" suggests that they are performing alone rather than as part of a larger group. The most likely place for this to happen is on a stage, where a performer can stand alone and be the focus of attention for the audience. The other options, such as a studio or orchestra, may involve multiple musicians working together or may not involve a live audience.
Africa | Knowledge: The Indian Ocean is located to the east of Africa, so it would make sense that the ocean borders the continent. The other choices do not have a geographical connection to the Indian Ocean.
experience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone stays in and reads a book all day, they are missing out on something. Since reading a book is a solitary activity, it's likely that the thing they are missing out on is some sort of social or interactive experience. The other options such as learning, education, knowledge, or learning to read are not necessarily mutually exclusive with reading books and therefore don't explain what someone would miss out on if they specifically stay in and read all day.
fabric store | Knowledge: A fabric store is a place that commonly sells cloth. This is in contrast to the other options, which do not typically have cloth readily available. Egyptian tombs may have preserved clothing made of cloth, but it would not be readily available for purchase or use. The kitchen and bedroom may have items made of cloth, but they are not places where cloth is typically stored or sold. The washing machine is used to clean clothes made of cloth, but it is not a place where cloth is found in abundance.
good | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had finished a chore (mowing his lawn) and was therefore taking a break to enjoy a refreshing beverage on his porch. The fact that he tells himself something after taking a sip of lemonade indicates that he is taking a moment to reflect on his life. The word "good" is a positive descriptor that conveys a sense of contentment and satisfaction with his life at that moment. The other options ("ending soon," "fleeting," "finite," "important") do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a more negative or uncertain outlook on life.
parking lot | Knowledge: The sentence implies that broken glass is a common occurrence that usually occurs after a bar closes. Considering the options, parking lots are a typical setting for a bar's customers to park their cars. It is likely that people may accidentally drop bottles or glasses while walking to and from their vehicles. While other options may also have broken glass, they are not as commonly associated with bar closures.
wall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trim is separating two surfaces and the options that could be separated by a line would be a wall and a floor. The other options, such as obesity or sky, do not correlate with the context of the sentence. Similarly, a desk does not necessarily require a trim to divide it from the floor, and the ceiling is usually separated from the floor by a wall rather than a trim.
arcade | Knowledge: The question implies that firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is a game that can be played. This game is typically found in arcades as a carnival or circus themed attraction. The other options do not provide any context related to the game's setting, so they are unlikely to be correct answers.
cemetery | Knowledge: A cemetery is a place where people are buried after they have died. Therefore, it is the most likely option for finding a dead body. The other choices may also relate to death, but they do not necessarily imply the presence of a dead body. A trunk could refer to a suitcase or car trunk, which could be used to transport a body. A funeral is a ceremony held to honor and remember someone who has died, but not necessarily where the body is found. A basement and closet are typically found in houses or buildings and may be used for storage or hiding, but again do not necessarily suggest the presence of a dead body.
laziness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the guy is choosing to go to bed instead of going to work, indicating a lack of motivation or productivity. This could be explained by laziness, as the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Money" and "making love" do not seem relevant, while "dreaming of" and "falling asleep" suggest unconscious actions rather than a conscious decision to skip work.
valley | Knowledge: Apple trees are commonly associated with growing in valley regions, where the climate is cool and mild with moderate rainfall. This environment provides ample growing conditions for apple trees, which require well-drained soil and good air circulation. The other options, such as Washington State or open fields, do not necessarily indicate a specific area where apple trees are commonly found.
inspiration | Knowledge: The sentence is talking about creative activities, specifically playing the piano. Inspiration is often a key component in any artistic endeavor, and playing the piano is no exception. While making music and creating musical sounds are important aspects of playing the piano, the sentence is asking for a broader term that encompasses all creative activities. Dancing is not related to playing the piano at all, and "make music" and "making music" are essentially the same answer with different phrasing.
go to jail | Knowledge: Committing murder is a serious crime that typically results in the perpetrator being sentenced to jail time. While the other options may be associated with murder in some way, such as feeling distress or fear before or after the act, or experiencing problems as a result of their actions, going to jail is the most direct and likely consequence of committing murder.
shoe | Knowledge: A heel is a feature commonly found on shoes, as it is a raised part of the sole that provides support and lifts the wearer's heel. It is not typically found on other articles of clothing, such as a loaf of bread or a sock. While boots do often have heels, the question specifically asks about "apparel," which could refer to a wider range of clothing items beyond footwear.
orbit | Knowledge: The question is asking for the specific term used to describe the path of the earth around the sun. "Orbit" is the correct answer because it refers specifically to the elliptical path that a celestial body takes around a larger body, such as the earth's path around the sun. "Fotograph," "tree," "solar system," and "attraction" are not related to the earth's motion around the sun, and therefore are not the correct answer.
shelf | Knowledge: The question asks about where to put a vase on the wall, which suggests that the vase needs to be elevated and supported. A cabinet or table would not be on the wall, and a windowsill may not be sturdy enough to hold a vase. "Fall off shelf" is not a suitable option. "Shelf" is the most appropriate choice as it provides a surface to hold the vase and is mounted on the wall.
California | Knowledge: Hollywood is a neighborhood located in Los Angeles, California, known for its association with the American film industry. The other choices do not have any connection to Hollywood or the U.S. coastline. Denmark is a country in Europe, boulevard is a street, country is a general term, and United States is too broad to be considered a specific answer.
reproduce | Knowledge: Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms create descendants. Humans, like most other animals, reproduce sexually, meaning they produce offspring through the union of male and female reproductive cells. The other choices (regret, drive cars, hear sounds, make mistakes) do not relate to the biological process of reproduction.
pants | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the robber wanted to hide his pistol, which is something that could easily be done by placing it in a location that is not visible to others. The option "police station" is unlikely because it's a place where guns are kept secure, whereas the robber wants to keep his gun hidden. "War" is also an unlikely option as it doesn't have any clear connection to the sentence. "Police officer's belt" might be a possible answer, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that the robber was near a police officer or had access to their belt. "River" is also unlikely as it would be an inconvenient and ineffective place to hide a gun.
garage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James removed some kind of clutter or debris from where he sleeps and placed it elsewhere. The options "attic," "drawer," and "television" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not places where one would typically store junk. "Bed" is a possibility, but since James is throwing the junk away, it is more likely that he is moving it to a separate location, such as a garage, which is often used for storage.
lap | Knowledge: Tabby cats are known for being affectionate and enjoy being close to their owners. Sitting on someone's lap is a common behavior for a tabby cat, especially if they want to get warm and cozy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dining room | Knowledge: A table is commonly used for dining and therefore would most likely be placed in a dining room. While a table could be found in other areas such as a living room or kitchen, those spaces are not primarily used for dining purposes. The options "conference" and "demonstration" are not typically associated with a household setting and are unlikely choices.
white teeth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was using mouthwash regularly for a specific reason. One common reason for using mouthwash is to promote dental hygiene and achieve white teeth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
overweight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the desire to get in shape is motivated by a need to address a physical condition - being overweight. While there may be other reasons why someone wants to get in shape, such as wanting to look attractive or feel good, the statement specifically references a physical condition. The other options - sex and bowel movements - are unrelated to the topic of getting in shape.
tow truck | Knowledge: The use of a tow chain implies that the vehicle is capable of towing something behind it, which rules out options like motorbike and jewelry store. The term "trailer" also suggests a vehicle that is designed for towing, but it is not explicitly stated that a tow chain is used with a trailer. Gear shift does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Therefore, tow truck is the most likely answer.
auditorium | Knowledge: The phrase "accommodate cumbersome clothing" suggests that the seats were designed for a setting where people might be wearing bulky or formal attire, such as in an auditorium where people might attend performances or ceremonies. The other options, like a bowling alley or beach, do not typically require formal or cumbersome clothing to be worn, making them less likely answers. Additionally, the phrase "space shuttle" is a red herring, including an option that seems unusual or unexpected but not directly relevant to the context of the question.
newspaper | Knowledge: The phrase "contains many a story" suggests that the answer is a publication that regularly features multiple stories. While books, magazines, and novels can contain multiple stories, they are typically not black and white. Story books may be black and white, but they are not typically associated with containing multiple stories on a regular basis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is newspaper, which is traditionally black and white and contains a variety of news stories.
concert | Knowledge: The actions described in the sentence (jumping up and down, screaming loudly, banging their heads) suggest a high-energy and exciting environment, which is commonly associated with concerts. The other options do not fit this context - "water" is too vague, "in class" and "meeting" are unlikely to involve such behavior, and the "mall" is an unusual place for people to act this way.
power turbine | Knowledge: Dams are typically built across rivers or other bodies of water to create a large reservoir that can be used to generate electricity. Water enters the dam through an intake valve or gate and flows into a penstock, which is a large pipe that carries the water to the power turbine. The force of the water in the penstock turns the blades of the turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Wet clothes, cracks, thin soup, and dribble are not related to the process of generating electricity in a dam.
destroy enemy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was involved in a battle and felt a strong emotion that influenced their actions. Anger is commonly associated with aggression and a desire to harm others, which may explain why the person was driven to destroy their enemy. The other options do not make sense in the context of a battle where anger is present.
problem | Knowledge: When something is broken, it is typically not working as it should, indicating that there is a problem. Therefore, someone who is trying to find an answer for a situation where something is broken is likely looking for a way to fix the problem. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of something being broken.
countries  | Knowledge: The question is asking about differences between people living in different parts of the world, so we can assume the answer is related to geographical or cultural differences. The first option, countries, is the most likely answer as it refers to the different nations or states that make up the world and the unique characteristics of their people. The other options - space, universe, thought, and obesity - do not have a direct connection to the question's context.
education | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy likes seeing new teachers because he enjoys meeting new people. However, it also implies that Billy doesn't care about the quality of his education, as this is not mentioned in the sentence. The other options, such as excitement or envy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "University of Chicago" is not relevant to the sentence, since it is not mentioned whether Billy attends or aspires to attend this institution.
locked | Knowledge: This question is asking for a verb that can only be applied to a door and not to a jar. The answer is "locked" because you can lock a door using a key, padlock, or other devices, but you can't lock a jar as it typically does not have a locking mechanism. The other options, such as "closed" or "opened," are applicable to both doors and jars.
university | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Billy is a student taking a course, which implies that he is enrolled in an educational institution. The other options (every aspect of life, library, in a movie hall, classroom) do not necessarily suggest an academic setting. The option "university" is the most likely answer as it is a common place for students to take courses in communications.
London | Knowledge: Tearooms are typically associated with British culture, and London is a well-known city in England that is famous for its tea culture. Many tearooms can be found in London, offering a variety of tea blends and tea-based products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
impatience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is frustrated with driving to work, specifically with traffic. The use of the word "chore" implies that it is something she does not enjoy, and the mention of traffic hints at a potential cause of her frustration. The word "impatience" fits into this context as it is a common feeling associated with waiting in traffic. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not closely related to the situation described in the sentence.
office |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person feels like they are not valued as an individual and feel like they blend into the background in their work environment. This feeling is commonly associated with being in a large office where there are many employees and little personal interaction. The other options do not have any clear connection to feeling like a small, insignificant part of a larger system.
tired feet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny spent all day at the museum looking at exhibits, indicating that he was on his feet for an extended period. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he studied the exhibits carefully, indicating that he was likely moving around and engaging with the exhibits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he might have gone home due to tiredness in his feet from standing and walking all day. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
breathe deeply | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the astronaut was enjoying the sensation of breathing fresh air after being in space, which would likely lead to the ability to breathe deeply. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence or do not accurately reflect the experience of the astronaut.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lance was likely in a natural setting, since he spotted a beaver in a river. The most logical option from the choices would be countryside, which is typically associated with natural landscapes and wildlife. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
books | Knowledge: The question is asking where you could find out more information about a type of lizard, which suggests you need to look for a source of information. The options "garden floor," "rocks," "bushes," and "garden" do not provide any clear sources of information, while "books" is a commonly used source for research and learning. Additionally, books may contain detailed descriptions of different types of lizards, including their habitat, behavior, and physical characteristics.
lower back pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person is using their whole body for work, which can often result in lower back pain due to strain and exertion on the spine. The other options, such as making mistakes or having big muscles, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Sore muscles could be a possible symptom, but lower back pain is a more specific and likely one in this case.
emergency room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a doctor would "rush" somewhere, which implies that there is an urgent need for medical attention. The only choice that reflects an urgent medical situation is the emergency room. A nursing home typically has patients who require long-term care, and while a dentist may be necessary for some urgent dental situations, it is not likely that a doctor would rush to a dental office. The same applies to sick patients in general. The golf course is not related to any medical event.
barber shop | Knowledge: Razors are commonly used for shaving, which is a service provided by barbers in traditional barber shops. The other options do not relate to the context of the question.
deceive himself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person observed their wife being unfaithful but is choosing to ignore it or pretend it never happened. This is an example of self-deception or denial. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
intelligent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the contestant's design idea caught the attention of the judges because it was smart, which implies that the contestant was intelligent. The word "smart" generally refers to something that is clever or well thought out, which is a characteristic often associated with intelligence. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. "Garish" means excessively bright or flashy, which is unlikely to have impressed the judges. "Ignorant" and "backward" are negative terms that suggest a lack of knowledge or understanding, which would not have been a positive characteristic in a design competition.
solitude |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys being away from large crowds and values moments of being alone. This suggests that the correct answer is "solitude" rather than "small group" or "leisurely" which both imply being with others. "Alone" and "solitary" are similar in meaning but "solitude" more accurately describes the enjoyment of being alone rather than just being by oneself.
constellation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is using one specific star to help them locate other objects in the sky. This is a characteristic commonly associated with constellations, which are groups of stars that are named and recognized based on their patterns in the sky. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
looking good | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was trying to improve his appearance in order to attract women. The goal of grooming is often to enhance one's appearance by being neat, clean, and well-dressed. The options "tardiness" and "late" have no relevance to the context, while "bathe" is a basic hygiene practice and doesn't necessarily imply an effort to look more attractive. "Neatness" is a possibility, but "looking good" is a more direct and accurate answer given the context of attracting women.
store window | Knowledge: The use of the word "clerk" implies that the sign was posted in a commercial setting, rather than a hallway or toilet. Additionally, the fact that the sign was made of paper suggests that it was not intended to be a permanent fixture, so it is likely that the clerk put it in a location with high visibility to draw attention to a sale or promotion. The options "public place" and "hallway" are too general to suggest a specific location, while "toilet" is unlikely for a promotional sign. Therefore, "store window" is the most logical choice.
dog | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pet in question is capable of scratching and has fur. This would eliminate options like bird or rug that do not fit the context. The bare spot beneath the whiskers implies that the pet is a mammal with hair or fur growing in that area. Given that the fleas caused the scratching, the pet is likely either a cat or a dog. However, cats do not typically have whiskers below their noses, so dog would be the correct answer. Carpet is an unlikely option since it does not have any relevance to the sentence.
Tongues | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that cats have, but humans and some other animals do not have. Since all options except for "tongues" are body parts or features that all animals possess, it can be inferred that the correct answer is related to a specific characteristic of a cat's tongue, such as its rough texture or ability to taste certain flavors that other animals cannot.
sea water | Knowledge: An anemone is a marine creature that lives in the sea, so it is most likely to be found in the sea water. Additionally, the phrase "warm water" suggests that the anemone may not be found in colder waters like the Atlantic or South Pacific, which eliminates those options. Florists and nurseries are places where plants are grown and sold, so they have no connection to the question.
cool down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characters in the sentence were looking for relief from the heat, which is commonly associated with the goal of cooling down. Eating ice cream is a common way to cool down on a hot day, as the cold temperature of the treat can help to lower body temperature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
marriage | Knowledge: Divorce is the legal process of ending a marriage, so the institution being dissolved in a divorce is the marriage itself. The other choices either do not accurately describe the situation or are not directly related to the legal process of divorce.
Virginia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that George is interested in hunting foxes. Virginia is known to be a popular destination for fox hunting due to its large population of foxes and fox hunting culture. The other options, such as hen house and lion's den, do not have any connection to fox hunting, and painting is not an activity that involves live animals. California may also have foxes, but it is not commonly known as a destination for fox hunting.
magazine article | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking for something to read while waiting at the doctor's office. The most likely option from the choices provided would be a magazine article, as these are often found in waiting rooms and cover a variety of topics that can be read quickly. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence, as a safe deposit box, hotel menu book, and library are not things that one typically finds in a doctor's office, and the word "book" is too general and could refer to anything.
table | Knowledge: The sentence describes a common practice when eating a meal, which is to place a cup on a surface. The most likely surface for this action is a table, which is used for dining and typically has enough space to accommodate a cup. The other options do not make sense in this context - a dishwasher is used for cleaning dishes, a shelf is usually elevated and not a good surface for placing cups, a coaster is specifically designed for cups but may not always be available, and a closet is not a surface for placing cups at all.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bo was not doing anything wrong and that the police did not have a reason to arrest him. The fact that they thought he was just "home" implies that he was not out causing trouble or breaking any laws. The other choices, such as "donut shop" or "direct traffic," do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not indicate innocence or lack of criminal activity.
wrinkles | Knowledge: Ironing clothes is a common practice to remove wrinkles and creases that may have formed during washing, drying, or storage. The heat and pressure from the iron help to smooth out the fabric and give it a crisp appearance. Sanitation is not a primary reason for using an iron, although ironing can help to kill bacteria and freshen up clothes. "Attractive appearance" and "looks good" are essentially the same as removing wrinkles. "Ruined" is the opposite of the intended result.
safe | Knowledge: A safe is a secure container typically used to store valuable items such as cash, jewelry, and important documents. It is designed to be difficult to break into or steal from, and often has a lock or combination to provide added security. The other options do not typically have locks and are not commonly associated with storing valuables in the same way that a safe is.
water | Knowledge: A teakettle is commonly used for boiling water, which is an essential step in preparing tea. While tea would also be an acceptable answer, water is the more general and basic answer that would fit any situation where a teakettle is being used. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the question.
washing dishes | Knowledge: The word "astray" suggests that the dishes are not in their proper place or are dirty, which would require someone to clean them. The only option that directly relates to cleaning dishes is washing dishes, while the other choices do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
all of the above | Knowledge: The word "all kinds" suggests that the answer is not limited to one specific source of knowledge. Encyclopedias and books are commonly associated with a wide variety of information, but knowledge can also be gained through personal experiences and interactions with others, as in a class. Newspapers may provide current events and specific pieces of knowledge, but can also contain a diverse range of topics and perspectives. Therefore, all of the options listed could be valid sources of knowledge.
awake | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dream was unpleasant or frightening, which would make the dreamer want to wake up and escape from the dream. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not relate to the dream being terrible or the dreamer wanting to escape from it.
movies | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the library was seeking to increase community engagement, and one way they did this was by screening a particular type of film. The options "monitor" and "homes" do not make sense in this context, while "drive in movie" and "theatre" are more specific locations for screening movies. "Movies" is the most general option and fits best with the sentence.
backpack | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the food needs to be carried along on a long walk, and the most common way to do so would be in a backpack or a similar bag. The other options, such as a table or a jar, do not make sense in this context as they are not practical for carrying food on a long walk in the countryside. A box or a container may work, but a backpack is generally the most convenient and popular choice.
shopping mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a specific item in a larger shopping area, which is commonly found in shopping malls. Clothing stores, thrift stores, and laundromats are not typically found in a shopping mall and would not require hours of browsing. A shopping plaza could be a possibility, but the term "shopping mall" is more commonly used to describe a large indoor shopping area with multiple stores.
city | Knowledge: The word "thoroughfare" suggests that James was driving on a main road or street. The options "country" and "town" do not fit with this context, as they suggest a more rural or small community setting. "Traffic" is also unlikely to be the correct answer, as it is just a general term for the volume of vehicles on a road, whereas the question is asking about James' home surroundings. "House" is not a good fit either, as it doesn't provide any information about the location or setting of James' drive. Therefore, "city" is the most likely answer.
freezer | Knowledge: Perishable food needs to be kept at a low temperature to extend its shelf life. The only option that provides a low temperature is the freezer, making it the correct answer. The other options either do not provide a low temperature or are not suitable for storing food.
hotel | Knowledge: When someone rents a room, it is typically in a hotel or other lodging establishment, where the passageway to the room would be located within the building. The other options - cave, jungle, maze, and freeway - are not relevant to the context of the question as they do not typically involve renting a room with a passageway.
boat house | Knowledge: A canoe is a type of boat that is typically used for recreational activities on bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it is logical to store a canoe in a place that is specifically designed for boats, such as a boat house. The other options, such as a mountain stream or campground, may be places where a canoe could be used, but they are not necessarily places where one would store a canoe. A garage may be an alternative option, but it is less common than a boat house for storing boats.
joy | Knowledge: The question is asking about the emotional state you might experience when meeting a friend whose company you greatly enjoy. Joy is a positive emotion commonly associated with feelings of happiness and pleasure. The other options may also be associated with meeting a friend, but do not necessarily capture the specific emotional response suggested in the question. Talking, relaxation, excitement, and fun could all be present in a positive social encounter, but do not necessarily capture the emotional response.
Grand Canyon | Knowledge: Helicopter tours are often associated with aerial views of natural landmarks or sites of natural beauty. The mention of a bald eagle in the sentence also suggests that the landmark being referred to is likely to be a place where bald eagles are commonly found. Out of the given options, the Grand Canyon is a well-known natural landmark that is often visited by tourists on helicopter tours. Additionally, bald eagles are known to inhabit the area around the Grand Canyon, making it the most likely option among the choices provided. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence's context.
table | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where shoes should not be placed. The options include walking, which is an activity rather than a location, and closet and suitcase, which are both common places to store shoes. The options of table and bed are both flat surfaces where shoes could easily be placed, but it is generally considered inappropriate to put shoes on either of these surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is table.
applaud | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the professor began to preach during the lecture and the other students reacted in a way that the speaker found odd. Applauding is a possible reaction to a speaker who is perceived as inspiring or motivating, so it makes sense that the students started to applaud. Laughing or taking notes would not necessarily be an unusual response, and falling asleep would not be a reaction to a professor becoming preachy. Learning is also not considered an unusual reaction to attending a lecture.
risk | Knowledge: The sentence implies that committing perjury is a serious offense that carries significant consequences, such as a high risk of punishment or penalty. The other options (arrest, shame, tension) may also be associated with committing perjury, but they do not fully capture the severity of the situation described.
cleanliness | Knowledge: Housework is typically done to maintain a clean and organized living space. Allergies may also be a reason to clean, but it wouldn't necessarily be the main focus of the question. Joy or exhaustion may not be the primary motivation for doing housework, and boredom isn't necessarily a reason to clean, as there are many other things one could do to alleviate boredom.
fieldhouse | Knowledge: A catwalk typically refers to a narrow elevated platform used for walking, which is commonly found in theaters or on airplanes for crew members. New York City is a possible location for a catwalk, but it is not specific enough to determine its likelihood. A fieldhouse, on the other hand, is more likely to be an indoor sports facility with a large open space, making it an unlikely location for a catwalk. Therefore, the correct answer is fieldhouse.
tropics | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location being referred to is known for strong storms that originate from the ocean. The tropics are known for experiencing powerful storms and hurricanes due to warm ocean waters and other atmospheric conditions, which makes this the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cupboard | Knowledge: Sugar is typically stored in cupboards or pantries in homes and kitchens, as it is a common ingredient used in cooking and baking. Coffee, bank lockers, and candy bars do not typically serve as storage locations for household sugar. "Every home" is too broad and vague to be a specific answer to this question, as sugar may be stored in a variety of places within a home.
colorado | Knowledge: Bald eagles are native to North America and are commonly found in areas with large bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines. Colorado is a state located in the western United States that has many bodies of water and is within the range of the bald eagle's habitat. The other choices do not provide any relevant information about where bald eagles live.
wall | Knowledge: A vertical surface typically refers to a surface that stands upright, like a wall. Pictures are commonly displayed on walls using nails, hooks, or other hanging devices. The other options- shelf, desktop, editer, and art show- do not necessarily refer to vertical surfaces where pictures would commonly be displayed.
embarrassment | Knowledge: The sentence implies that falling in front of people while going to a public store may cause a person to feel a certain way. The word "felt" is in the past tense, suggesting that the person has already experienced this. The word "embarrassment" is the best answer because falling in front of people can be a humiliating experience that may make a person feel self-conscious or awkward. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotions that a person in this situation would feel.
Washington D.C. | Knowledge: Washington D.C. is the capital of the United States and where the United States government is located. This includes the White House, Congress, and various government agencies. Therefore, it is the most likely choice for the city where most U.S. politicians work. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
fear | Knowledge: The question asks what could happen if someone threatens to charge you with obstructing justice, not what the actual consequences would be if you were charged with obstructing justice. Therefore, none of the options involve actual legal consequences such as being fined or going to jail. However, being threatened can certainly cause fear or anxiety, which is the closest option to the question being asked.
driveway | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man left his car outside when he got home from work. The options "exit ramp" and "repair shop" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they relate to locations outside of the man's home. "Front yard" is a possibility, but "driveway" is a more specific and likely answer since it is a common area to leave a car parked outside of one's home. "Garage" could also be a possibility but the sentence implies that the car was not put away in the garage.
backpack | Knowledge: The question is about where a student might store a pencil while traveling, which suggests that the answer should be a portable, convenient option. A backpack is a common choice for students to carry their school supplies in, especially when traveling or on the go. The other options, such as desktop or desk drawer, are stationary and not suitable for traveling. Pocket may be an option, but it depends on the size of the pencil and the type of clothing being worn, which adds uncertainty to the answer.
conference | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the situation involves multiple people speaking over speakers, which is a common setup for a conference call. A conference call is a type of phone call that allows multiple participants to join in from different locations. The other options, such as desktop or headphones, don't necessarily have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
buy food | Knowledge: Going on vacation typically involves leaving one's home and traveling to another location. Before doing so, a person would need to make sure they have enough food to sustain themselves during their trip or to have food waiting for them upon their return. Resting or lying in bed are not necessarily specific actions taken before vacation and crossing the street or watering plants are unrelated.
stable | Knowledge: Leather horseback riding equipment, such as saddles, bridles, and boots, are typically found at stables or equestrian supply stores. They are used specifically in the context of horseback riding, so options like car seats or handbags do not make sense. Department stores may have some equestrian equipment, but it would likely be limited in selection. Merry go rounds also have no connection to horseback riding equipment.
make money | Knowledge: The other options do not provide a compelling reason for why someone would want to keep working. Frustration and boredom would typically lead someone to want to stop working, while being paid and blisters are simply consequences of work rather than reasons for continuing it. Making money, on the other hand, is a clear motivation for many people to continue working, as it allows them to meet their financial needs and achieve their personal goals.
envelope | Knowledge: The question is asking where to put a letter if someone wants to pay a bill from their house. The most common way to pay a bill by mail would be to put the payment in an envelope and address it to the company that bills for the service. The other options may be related to organizing or storing documents, but they are not specific to paying bills or sending mail.
make bread | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill likes to do creative things on rainy days and that he loves to taste things. Making bread is a creative activity that involves tasting and experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. The other options (enjoy film, go to the gym, stay in bed, write) do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence, so they are less likely to be correct.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person had a negative experience at work, which may lead to feelings of stress or anxiety upon returning. The other options do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
dry hands | Knowledge: The correct answer should be the next logical step in the sequence. After flushing the toilet and washing your hands, the next step would be to dry your hands. None of the other options make sense in the context of the sequence.
bank savings | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person deposited a check, which is a common action taken when trying to save money or add to one's bank account. The option "bank savings" is the most relevant and logical choice based on the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
building | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the cafe has both indoor and outdoor seating options. The term "building" makes the most sense in this context as it refers to a physical structure where the cafe is located. The other choices are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information.
books and magazines | Knowledge: Literature refers to written works that have artistic or intellectual value, including books, poems, plays, and essays. Newspapers may contain written works, but they are considered more of a source of news and information rather than literature. "Own home" and "good homes" do not make sense as options as they are not related to literature. A public library may contain literature, but it is not necessarily a type of literature itself. "Books and magazines" is the best answer as it directly refers to written works that are a part of literature.
location | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is some discrepancy between how the place feels and what someone higher up has said. This implies that there is some uncertainty or confusion about the correct location. The other options do not make sense in this context - a job, map, line, or almost anywhere would not create the same sense of uncertainty or conflict.
drunkenness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject of the sentence engaged in excessive celebration, which often resulted in some negative consequences. One of the most common results of excessive drinking is drunkenness, which can cause impaired judgement, loss of control, and other negative effects. The other options may be associated with celebration as well, but they do not specifically relate to the negative consequences mentioned in the sentence.
cup | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person loaded up their plate with food and is now looking for something to wash it down with. Based on this context, the most likely item he would look for is a cup, as this is the common container for beverages. The other options do not make sense in this specific context.
camera  | Knowledge: A picture of a thermometer would most likely be taken with a camera, as opposed to being found in a cabinet, drawer, doctor's office, or hospital. A camera is a tool used to capture visual images, making it the most likely option for taking a picture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
forgetfulness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is experiencing unexpected episodes of unconsciousness, which is a common symptom of a concussion. Additionally, the sentence states that he is also suffering from something else. The word "annoying" implies that whatever he is experiencing is more of an inconvenience than a serious medical issue. The option "coma" and "death" are both extreme and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Falling down" and "pain" could be related to a concussion, but they do not fit with the idea of him losing consciousness at annoying times. "Forgetfulness" is a common symptom of a concussion and fits well with the context of the sentence.
beach | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer is a place where a large number of sand grains can be found. Beaches are commonly associated with sand, as they are often made up of large quantities of it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
crash | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a computer has stopped working, which is commonly referred to as a "crash". The other options do not accurately describe the situation of a computer not working. "Do work" and "help people" are too general and don't specifically relate to computers. "Compute" is a verb that describes what a computer does, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working. "Networked" describes a type of computer connection, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working.
attic | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker needs to store old items in a place where they will not get damp, which suggests a dry and elevated location. A common place for this type of storage is an attic, which is typically a dry and insulated space located above the main living areas of a house. The other options are unlikely choices for storing old items, as a waste bin would not be suitable for preserving items or protecting them from dampness, a cellar may be too damp, a fridge is too small and not used for storage of non-food items, and a museum would not be accessible for personal use.
forest | Knowledge: The sentence mentions leaves falling each year and how a natural compost keeps the soil healthy for trees, indicating that it's referring to a natural environment where trees grow. Out of the given options, a forest would be the most likely setting for this type of ecosystem. The other options, such as a garden or orchard, may also benefit from a natural compost, but they do not necessarily have the same abundance of trees as a forest.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child is staying somewhere overnight and needs a place to keep their towel. The most likely option is at a hotel, where towels are often provided for guests and can be kept in the room. The other options do not make as much sense in this context – a backpack or shelf may be used to store personal items, but not a towel specifically, while a linen closet would not be accessible to a child staying at a hotel. The swimming pool option also does not make sense, as a child would not need to bring their own towel to a swimming pool.
choose life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are advocating for the protection of fetuses, which is commonly associated with the anti-abortion movement. The phrase "Choose Life" is a common slogan used by the movement to promote their message. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
controversy | Knowledge: During official judging, it is important to avoid controversy because controversy can undermine the credibility of the judging process and suggest that a decision was not made fairly. Prejudice is another thing that should be avoided during judging because it suggests bias and unfairness toward a particular group. Verdict refers to the final decision made by a judge, which is not something that should be avoided during the actual judging process. Statement and evaluating are also not things that should be avoided but rather important parts of the judging process.
embarrassment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was not socially acceptable, as she was yelling obscenities in public. Therefore, her husband is likely to feel embarrassed by her actions, as they reflect on both her and him as a couple. The word "entertaining" implies that others found the situation amusing, but it does not provide any information about the husband's feelings. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to finding a telephone. The only option that has a clear association with telephones is "office." Offices typically have landline telephones as a means of communication for employees. The other options do not have any relevance to telephones.
talk on their phone | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that a student should not do something while their instructor is lecturing. Out of the given choices, talking on their phone is the only option that goes against basic classroom etiquette and disrupts the learning environment. The other options may be acceptable or even encouraged during lecture, such as studying engineering or reading a book.
enjoy themselves | Knowledge: A party is generally a social event, and people usually attend parties to have fun and enjoy themselves with others. The other options do not make sense in the context of attending a party. "To be alone" contradicts the purpose of a party, which is to socialize, and "believe in god" is not necessarily related to attending a party. "Face each other" and "group together" are vague and do not provide a clear reason for attending a party.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a particular place where plants can always be grown. The option "surface of earth" is the most likely correct answer since plants grow naturally in the soil and need sunlight and water to survive, which are all found on the earth's surface. The other options may be suitable for growing plants, but they are not always available or appropriate in every situation.
commercial building | Knowledge: The word "zoned" implies that there are regulations or restrictions on the type of building that can be constructed on a certain piece of land. In this case, James cannot build his concert hall because his land is not zoned for commercial buildings. The other options - theater, orchestras, city, and university building - doesn't have a direct connection to commercial building regulations.
have fun | Knowledge: When someone is going to watch their favorite sports team play, the main objective is to enjoy the experience regardless of whether the team wins or loses. Therefore, the most common thing someone will tell you when you let them know that you are going to watch your favorite team play is to have fun. The other options may also be appropriate, but they do not capture the essence of the experience as effectively as "have fun."
boat | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the priority is moving cargo at a low price, which suggests that the most affordable option would be the best choice. Boats are often used for transporting cargo as they are generally cheaper to operate than airplanes or trains, especially for large quantities of goods. Ships' holds are simply a part of a ship and cannot be used as a mode of transport. The other answer choices are either more expensive to use or prioritize speed over affordability.
movement | Knowledge: Hitting the side of a horse can cause it to move or start walking or running. This is a common method of communication between riders and horses, where a light tap or kick on the side of the horse can signal the horse to move in a particular direction or pick up pace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of hitting the side of a horse.
pass sentence | Knowledge: The sentence states that the jury determined the accused to be guilty of a crime. In the legal system, it is the role of the judge to pass judgement and decide an appropriate sentence for the convicted individual. Therefore, the correct answer is "pass sentence." The other options do not align with the context of the sentence and are unlikely outcomes for the situation presented.
sitting down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was at a lunch table and was trying to leave it. The phrase "arise from the lunch table" implies that James was seated at the table, which eliminates the options of falling down or lying down. The phrase "had done what" suggests that James was engaged in some activity while at the table, which makes the option "sitting down" most likely. The option "go ahead" is unlikely as it does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
have paper and literate | Knowledge: Writing a letter typically requires having something to write on, such as paper or a digital screen, as well as the ability to read and write, known as being literate. Not giving up, moving fingers, and keeping warm are not necessary components of writing a letter and are not relevant to the context of the question.
library | Knowledge: A library is a place specifically dedicated to housing a large collection of books and other written materials. It is designed for people to read, study and research, therefore it is likely that someone could find a huge amount of text in a library. The other options do not have the same kind of association with large quantities of text, such as a newspaper being limited to a single issue or a writer's brain being limited by their own capacity to create.
star trek | Knowledge: The term "nerdy" often refers to someone who is very interested in academic or intellectual pursuits such as science or technology. "Star Trek" is a popular science fiction franchise that typically appeals to individuals with an interest in these subjects. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
public place | Knowledge: The phrase "civic meeting" suggests that the meeting is open to the public and therefore, the paper sign advertising the meeting should be posted in a public place where it can be easily seen by individuals passing by. The other options may not be as visible to the general public or may not be appropriate for posting public notices.
a huge knife | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crab had a reaction to something it saw in the kitchen, and that something was most likely a threat to the crab's safety. Out of the options given, a huge knife is the most likely threat that would cause a crab to react in fear. Boiling water and cold water are unlikely to cause a visible reaction in the crab, while the Pacific Ocean and fish market are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
not enough information to determine an answer | Knowledge: The sentence does not provide sufficient information to determine where the person taking the call is likely to be. It only states that they are away from work. The choices may all be possible depending on the context of the situation, so without more information, it is impossible to choose a correct answer.
bliss or orgasm | Knowledge: The question is asking for the emotional response or outcome of sex. Bliss is a word commonly used to describe a state of extreme happiness or joy, which could be associated with the feeling of intimacy and connection during sex. Orgasm is the physical and emotional climax of sexual activity, and is widely regarded as a positive and pleasurable experience. The other options are either negative (aids, getting pregnant) or unrelated (educations) to the context of the question.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where one can pay for food, which rules out options like backyard, texas, and louisiana. The mention of bbq and paying for it indicates that it is likely a restaurant that serves this type of cuisine. Ribs is a type of bbq, but it does not answer the question of where you are located. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant.
national park | Knowledge: Natural landmarks are typically preserved in national parks, which are designated areas set aside for the purpose of conserving natural resources and protecting unique features. The other options do not necessarily have the same conservation goals as national parks, and may not prioritize the protection of natural landmarks in the same way.
see favorite show | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is referring to a specific program that they want to watch on television, which makes "see favorite show" the most logical answer. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
distrust | Knowledge: Lying is often seen as a breach of trust, and it can lead to a breakdown in communication and a lack of trust in the person who lied. This is especially true when trying to find accurate information, as lying can lead to confusion and make it difficult to discern the truth. Hurt feelings and unhappiness may also result from lying, but they are not necessarily related to the process of finding accurate information. "Good things" is too broad and does not align with the negative connotations associated with lying in the question.
feel better | Knowledge: Rest is commonly associated with the relief of fatigue and exhaustion. After resting, it's typical to feel rejuvenated and more energized, which suggests that the correct answer is "feel better." The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the question.
terrible | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that killing people is not a desirable or acceptable behavior, which is reflected in the word "terrible." Going to jail is a consequence of committing a crime, but it does not reflect the moral or ethical position on the act itself. Joy would not be an appropriate association with killing people, as most people would not feel happy or joyful about taking someone else's life. Mistake implies that the act was unintentional, which may not be the case in this context. Murder is a synonym for killing, but it carries additional legal and moral connotations that may not apply universally.
warfare | Knowledge: The sentence implies that violence is common in sports, but Danny does not participate in any sport. Therefore, the violence he engages in must be in a different context. The only option that fits this context is warfare, which is a known context for violence. The other options are either redundant or do not fit the context of the sentence.
blisters | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consequence of walking too much with poorly fitting shoes will be mentioned. Since poorly fitting shoes can rub against the skin and cause irritation, blisters are a common result of this. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
wear out | Knowledge: The phrase "washing clothes over and over many times" suggests repetitive use or action, which can lead to wear and tear on the clothes. Clothes that are washed too often or too vigorously can lose their shape, fade, or become thin and fragile. "Transmutate," "torn," and "get wet" are not related to the context of washing clothes, while "wet clothes" is redundant and doesn't provide an answer to the question.
commercial | Knowledge: The sentence describes a type of performance on TV that aims to promote the purchase of a certain product. This type of performance is commonly known as a commercial, which is a televised advertisement. The other options, such as newspaper or theatre, do not involve TV, while show and movie may promote a product indirectly, but not necessarily through a performance by actors.
airport  | Knowledge: The word "connection" implies that this question is referring to a layover or transfer, where a traveler switches from one flight to another. Such transfers typically occur at airports, which have designated terminals, gates, and shuttle services for connecting flights. The other options listed have no relevance to air travel or transportation.
one mouth | Knowledge: The question is asking about the human body part that is used for speaking. The most obvious answer is the mouth as it is the primary tool for producing speech sounds. The other options (one hand, two ears, brains, two legs) do not have a direct connection to the act of speaking.
have money | Knowledge: The question is asking what you need to afford a vacation, so the correct answer would be having money to spend on the trip. Selling your house is not necessary for a vacation, saving money is a way to obtain the necessary funds, packing is not related to financial ability, and vacating is not a valid term in this context.
complete collection | Knowledge: The phrase "one of every kind" suggests that the person has gathered a complete set of something, which is commonly referred to as a collection. The other options do not make sense in the context of having one of every kind of something. "Have to hold" and "procrastinate" are verbs that don't fit the sentence structure, "hobby" is a noun that could potentially fit but doesn't accurately describe the person's possession, and "acknowledgment" is a completely unrelated concept.
marine museum | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the jaw skeleton of a shark was on display for children to walk through, making it likely that this is an attraction at a place where marine animals are displayed or studied. The option "marine museum" is the only choice that fits this context, while the other choices have no clear connection to the sentence.
enjoying | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was unable to concentrate on playing a game with friends due to some kind of obstacle or distraction, and that they wished they could be doing something else with it instead. The word "enjoying" fits this context because it suggests that the person would rather be having fun playing the game with their friends instead of struggling to concentrate. The other options ("gaming," "anger," "stress," and "injury") do not fit this context as well, and do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
flatulence | Knowledge: A whoopee cushion is a practical joke item that makes a fart noise when someone sits on it. Therefore, the correct answer is flatulence, as it is the sound that is commonly associated with a whoopee cushion. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone sitting on a whoopee cushion.
airport | Knowledge: The word "landing" suggests that the traveler is on a mode of transportation that is capable of landing, such as an airplane. Additionally, the use of the word "convenience" implies that the traveler is referring to a transportation hub such as an airport, where there are many options for connecting flights or ground transportation. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not involve modes of transportation that "land".
map | Knowledge: The context suggests that the man is looking for a visual representation of the United States, implying that he wants to see it on a map. An atlas is a book of maps, but a map specifically shows the geography of a particular region. The other options (history book, tv channels, northern hemisphere) do not relate to the subject matter of finding the United States on a visual.
park | Knowledge: The word "together" suggests that the families are looking for a place where they can gather and spend time with each other. A funeral would not be an appropriate place to decide on dinner together, as it is a somber event. Similarly, a wedding may not be suitable if the families are not closely related or if they are not attending the same wedding. A supermarket and a hotel are also not typically places where families would gather to decide on dinner. However, a park is a common location for families to enjoy outdoor activities and have picnics, which could include discussing where to go for dinner.
arm himself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was afraid of burglars who might be violent or have the potential to be violent. In this context, 'arming oneself' means preparing oneself with tools or weapons to defend oneself in case of an attack. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone who fears violent burglars.
playing dead | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a way to avoid getting bitten by a dog. Playing dead is a common survival strategy when confronted with a potential threat, and may help to prevent a dog from attacking if it believes the threat is no longer present. The other options, such as being a cat or being black, do not provide any clear solution to the problem of avoiding getting bitten by a dog.
play games | Knowledge: The question is asking for a good way to break boredom for kids. Out of the given choices, "play games" would be the most effective as it allows children to engage in a variety of activities that may cater to their interests and provide entertainment. Chess, basket, and cards require a specific skill set and may not be suitable for all children, while watching a film is a more passive activity that may not keep their attention for very long.
rainforest | Knowledge: Apple trees require temperate climates with distinct seasons and a certain number of chilling hours to produce fruit. Rainforests are typically hot and humid all year round and do not experience distinct seasons, making them unsuitable for growing apple trees. The other options are possible places to find apple trees as they have suitable climates and environments.
church grounds | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a pastor zoning a graveyard, which suggests that the graveyard is located on or near church property. The phrase "church grounds" is the only option that directly relates to this context, while the other choices are less likely to be associated with a church or religious setting.
hells canyon | Knowledge: Hells Canyon is a region located on the border of Nevada and Oregon known for its scenic waterways and wildlife, including bald eagles. The sentence suggests that the person was staying at a resort near this area and left on their boat from a dock in the north, where they spotted a bald eagle at the opposite end. The other options are not located in the same geographic region as Nevada and California or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
depression | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jamie had to leave work because of low serotonin levels, which is commonly associated with depression. Depression can cause fatigue, lethargy and low energy levels, which fits with the description of Jamie's condition. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk drawer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person has a valuable writing instrument and wants to keep it safe. One common place to store valuable items in an office is a desk drawer. The other options are less likely because they either do not provide a secure location (such as a writer's hand, pocket, or classroom) or involve getting rid of the item altogether (such as a pawn shop).
immodesty | Knowledge: The sentence states that modesty is an important virtue, and suggests that an insufficient amount of it in the face of individuals of greater station may be interpreted as something negative. This would likely be interpreted as immodesty, as the opposite of modesty is generally considered to be immodesty. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The sentence is referencing a specific type of store that sells sports equipment, tools, and lawn mowers. A sporting goods store is a retail store that specializes in selling sports equipment and accessories for a variety of sports. Sears is a department store that may sell sporting goods, but it does not specialize in them. Schools and museums would not typically sell sports equipment or lawn mowers. A sporting event is an activity or competition, not a place to buy goods.
buy things | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the purpose of going to the market is to buy things. The other options are related to the process of going to the market, but do not indicate the main objective of the trip. "Arriving at destination" is too general and could apply to any kind of journey, while "impulse buying" and "carrying bags" are only incidental aspects of shopping. "Pushing a cart" is also a necessary part of the shopping experience, but does not indicate the ultimate goal of the trip.
fall asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person listening to the quiet music began to snore and close their eyes, indicating that they may have fallen asleep. Quiet music is often associated with relaxation and calm, which could have contributed to the person's drowsiness. Deafness and resting do not have clear connections to the context of the sentence, while relaxation and calm are similar in meaning to fall asleep but do not explain why the person started snoring.
slot machine | Knowledge: The phrase "wished upon" suggests that the token has some kind of superstitious or magical significance. The options "coin collection," "loans," and "ashtray" do not fit this context, as they are not associated with wishing. "Pocket" could be a possibility, but it doesn't explain why the token is being desperately wished upon. "Slot machine," however, is a common object for people to make wishes on by giving it a "lucky" coin or token before playing, making it the most likely choice.
go somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person was curious and wanted to leave their small hometown, which implies a desire to explore and experience new things. The phrase "go somewhere" is the only option that fits this context, as the other options do not relate to travel or exploration. "Analyse," "die," and "read book" are all too specific or unrelated, while "see favorite show" may imply a desire to escape one's current location, but does not necessarily suggest a sense of curiosity or exploration.
enjoy yourself | Knowledge: The choices all relate to the concept of having fun, but only "enjoy yourself" captures the general positive feeling associated with having fun. "Have sex" is a specific type of activity that some people may enjoy for fun, but it does not encompass the full range of activities that people do for fun. "Waste time" has a negative connotation and suggests that fun is a frivolous or unproductive use of time, which is not necessarily true. "Laughter" and "spontaneous" are also related to having fun, but they are more specific and do not capture the broad motivation for why people want to have fun.
success | Knowledge: In academic settings, a 4.0 GPA is generally considered a perfect score, indicating that the student has achieved the highest level of success in their courses. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person was feeling successful after receiving their grades. The other options are not congruent with the context of the sentence, as graduation is not mentioned and headaches or failing again would likely not be associated with a perfect GPA.
engine | Knowledge: Rods and pistons are parts commonly found in engines, which are mechanical devices that convert fuel into motion. Engines are often used in vehicles such as cars, boats, and airplanes, as well as in industrial machinery and power generation systems. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Costco | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is not always found in a large volume, which suggests that the other options are typically found in a large volume. A collection or set of books, as well as a library, are commonly associated with large quantities of books. Similarly, a set of encyclopedias often includes multiple volumes. Costco, on the other hand, is a retail store and may or may not have large quantities of a particular item depending on the product.
cleanliness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan's mother emphasized the importance of bathing, which would be primarily for hygiene purposes. The option "cleanliness" directly relates to hygiene and therefore would be the correct answer. The other options either do not directly or indirectly relate to the context of the sentence or are erroneous (such as "nudity" being an outcome of bathing).
advertisement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cow was famous or well-known, which could be due to being featured in an advertisement. Advertisements often use catchy or memorable imagery, such as a famous cow, to promote a product or brand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
take bus | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally and another person were waiting in the rain, which implies that they were waiting for some form of transportation. The option "take bus" is the only option that relates to transportation, and waiting for the bus is a common experience. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
in a kitchen drawer | Knowledge: Based on the context of the sentence, it suggests that the fork is likely a utensil that is used for eating, and therefore it would be most practical to store it in a kitchen drawer when not in use. A box or plane do not seem like appropriate places to store utensils, while a table or plate could result in the fork getting dirty or lost.
mall | Knowledge: The word "customers" implies that the context is related to a commercial or business setting. Among the options given, only the mall is a place specifically designed for customers to walk around and browse shops. Parks are primarily for leisure and outdoor activities, markets usually have stalls or booths where customers can purchase goods, restaurants are typically for dining and not walking around, and bookstores may have seating areas but are not known for customers walking around.
beautiful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a great singer's voice is going to possess certain qualities. While volume may be important for some styles of singing, the use of the word "beautiful" implies that this is the primary characteristic being referred to here. Beauty in a vocalist's voice is subjective, but is generally related to tone, timbre, and resonance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
knit | Knowledge: The question is asking about indoor activities that can be done during the winter, which suggests that the correct answer should involve something that can be done inside the house. Skiing, skating, and playing hockey are outdoor winter sports that require specific equipment and spaces, so they are unlikely to be done inside the house. "Blaze it" is a non sequitur and has no relation to the question. Knitting, on the other hand, is a common indoor hobby, and it is a popular winter activity for many people.
sports arena | Knowledge: A basketball court is typically used for playing the sport of basketball. The other options do not relate to the function or purpose of a basketball court. "City" and "Los Angeles" are locations and do not imply a specific purpose. "Use" is too broad and could apply to any function or activity. "Soccer" is a different sport and typically played on a soccer field, not a basketball court.
bus station | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the extrovert enjoys interacting with strangers while taking public transportation to school. This implies that the extrovert is likely to take a bus instead of other modes of transportation such as a train or a taxi. The park and town do not have any connection to public transportation, and are therefore unlikely options.
unpredictable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weather can be difficult to predict, which implies that it may change frequently and without warning. This could be due to a variety of factors such as atmospheric conditions, geography, and climate patterns. The other options, such as "clear" or "hot or cold", do not add much insight into why the weather might be difficult to predict.
let down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not feel supported by others and was often disappointed by their actions. "Let down" means to disappoint someone by failing to provide them with the expected or needed support, which makes it the best choice among the given options. "Ignore" and "neglect" are similar in meaning, but they do not convey the sense of being let down by someone who was expected to provide support. "Marriage" and "aid" are not related to the context of the sentence.
falling down | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the subject tripped, which would likely result in them falling down. The other choices are not appropriate based on the context of the sentence - sweating and getting tired are common outcomes of running, but they do not specifically relate to tripping. Flying is not a plausible option at all, and working out is not an outcome of tripping.
gate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a mechanism that locks after someone drives in. A gate is a common feature of a driveway or entrance to a property, and it can have a locking mechanism to prevent unauthorized entry. The other options are less likely to have locking mechanisms and don't necessarily fit the context of a driveway or entrance.
university | Knowledge: Universities are widely regarded as institutions where higher education is provided, and as such, they usually offer courses in various disciplines, including science. While some of the other options, such as a state college or even a nanotechnology institution, may also offer courses in science, universities are generally associated with a broad range of academic fields. A space lab might suggest a place where scientific experiments are carried out in space, which is not what the question is asking. The option "school" is too general and does not provide any specific information.
advertisement | Knowledge: The other options (Nebraska, fairy tale, moon, slaughterhouse) do not fit the context of the question. An advertisement is a medium used to promote a product or service, and it is not uncommon to see fake animals being used in advertisements to grab people's attention. Therefore, it makes sense that one could find a fake cow in an advertisement.
sunny place | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was trying to warm itself up, which means it would need to be in a warm location. The term "sunny place" implies a location that receives direct sunlight, which is a source of warmth. The other options may not provide the warmth that the lizard needs, such as a shady spot or a porch, which may be cooler in temperature. Rocky areas and gardens are too general and do not provide any specific information related to the lizard's need for warmth.
mountains | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific location, above the cloud line, which is an altitude typically associated with high elevation areas such as mountains. A cottage in a village or rural area would not necessarily be above the cloud line, and a cottage in a valley would likely be surrounded by higher terrain. The mention of a fairy story does not provide any relevant information to determine the location of the cottage.
loss of money | Knowledge: Sally's conflicting feelings about shopping suggest that she may have a fear or anxiety about spending money, which could explain why it is painful for her to buy things even though she loves getting what she wants. The phrase "loss of money" suggests that Sally may feel a sense of financial insecurity or stress when she spends money, which would be consistent with her mixed feelings about shopping. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence or the possible reasons why Sally might find shopping painful.
sleepiness | Knowledge: Going to bed is typically associated with the need for sleep, which is often characterized by feelings of sleepiness or tiredness. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Bad dreams may be a reason someone wakes up or has trouble falling asleep, but not necessarily a reason for going to bed. Laziness and getting pregnant are also not directly related to the act of going to bed. Rest could be a reason for someone to take a break or relax, but it is not necessarily a synonym for going to bed.
redemption | Knowledge: Forgiveness is often associated with the concept of redemption, which refers to the act of restoring oneself to a state of moral righteousness or being saved from wrongdoings. The fact that the man is forgiving someone who betrayed him suggests that he is trying to redeem himself and move on from the negative feelings associated with the betrayal. The other options are not directly related to the concept of forgiveness and redemption.
corral | Knowledge: In the context of preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle, it is common to keep the males and females separated in a corral or pen. A corral is a confined area used for holding livestock, which would allow for easy separation and management of the animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle.
people will understand | Knowledge: The question suggests that expressing oneself in simple terms is likely to have a certain outcome, and the most logical outcome would be that people will understand what is being expressed. Expressing oneself in simple terms is a way of making ideas accessible and easy to grasp, which should lead to greater understanding. The other options have no apparent connection to the context of the question.
house | Knowledge: The question suggests that playing a board game with family is an activity typically done in a domestic setting, which is why the correct answer is "house." The other options do not fit the context of the question. A "toy store" and "shelf" are not places where one would typically play a board game, and a "mall" is a public space that is not typically associated with playing games. "Cupboard" is also not a suitable option, as it refers to a storage space, rather than a location for an activity.
case | Knowledge: A police officer typically reports their work by creating a case file. This file includes details of the incident, witness statements, evidence collected, and any actions taken by the officer, such as charging a person with a crime. Creating a case file is an important part of police work as it provides a record of the incident, which may be used in court or for further investigation. The other options do not seem to be related to reporting police work.
england | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the red telephone box is a common sight in the countryside of a particular country. The option "england" fits this context as red telephone boxes are commonly associated with England, particularly in rural areas. The other options, such as a restaurant or doctor, do not provide any context that would suggest the presence of a red telephone box. The option "city on street corner" may be a possible location for a phone box, but it contradicts the information that the sentence is set in the countryside.
trust himself | Knowledge: The word "confident" implies that someone is sure of themselves and their abilities. Therefore, it makes sense that a confident person would trust themselves and their decisions. Feeling important or owning a house do not necessarily relate to confidence, while crying suggests the opposite of confidence, which is vulnerability or insecurity. Knowing what time also does not relate to confidence.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is looking for a large church, which is often referred to as a megachurch. Megachurches are typically found in urban areas, which have larger populations and more resources to support such large places of worship. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cellar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is accessed through a staircase and is likely used for storage, as indicated by the reference to a jar of preserves. Out of the given options, only a cellar is typically accessed through a staircase and used for storing items like preserves. The other options do not match the context of the sentence.
working hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a trait that made them likely to get hired quickly for a job. The characteristic mentioned in the sentence is that the person had a reputation for something, and the context implies that this characteristic is a positive one. Working hard is a highly desirable trait for an employee, as it shows dedication and a willingness to put in effort for the job. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be traits that would help someone get hired quickly.
teach each other | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that two people have different knowledge or information and want to help each other by sharing what they know. In this scenario, the best course of action would be for both individuals to teach each other what they know, so that both parties benefit from the exchange. The other options either do not involve any exchange of knowledge or are not likely to be relevant to the context of the sentence.
criminal trial | Knowledge: The question is asking about the legal consequences of killing. Killing is usually considered a crime, which could result in a criminal trial. Guilty conscience, pleasure, and a fun day out are not appropriate responses because they do not relate to the legal consequences of killing. Retribution is a possible consequence of a criminal trial, but it is not the direct answer to the question being asked.
encyclopedia | Knowledge: Encyclopedias are reference books that contain information on various topics. They were popular before the age of the internet and search engines, but now they are considered outdated as information can be easily accessed through digital sources. The other choices may still be valid sources of gaining knowledge, especially books and libraries, which are still widely used.
unlikely | Knowledge: The phrase "being as she was committed" suggests that the woman has other obligations or commitments that may prevent her from showing up. This makes it unlikely that she will actually appear. The options "wont," "weakness," and "definitely" do not fit the context of the sentence and are not supported by any evidence. "Will" is a possibility, but the phrase "being as she was committed" suggests that it is not very likely.
home | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that after exiting a ring road, the destination is a group of homes. Therefore, the correct answer is "home." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The freeway system could be a possibility if the destination was further away and required the use of highways. The town, cars, and European city do not provide any indication of a specific destination.
maintain balance | Knowledge: The question suggests that learning to ski was a challenging activity, and the answer options provide possible difficulties that the person might have encountered. The option "maintain balance" is the most likely answer, as skiing requires a significant amount of balance and coordination to stay upright on the slopes. The other options, such as slipping on ice or falling down, are common occurrences while learning to ski but are not the most challenging aspect of the activity. Sweat is not directly relevant to the question and is not a difficulty that would typically be associated with learning to ski.
death | Knowledge: The phrase "clinging on to life" suggests that the person in question is in a very critical condition and is struggling to survive. The options "ending soon," "ill," "coma," and "void" may apply to someone who is experiencing a serious health challenge, but they do not specifically indicate that the person's life is in danger. "Death" is the only option that explicitly conveys the idea of a person fighting to stay alive.
violin | Knowledge: The sentence describes a medieval costumed man playing music and moving their hands wildly on the fingerboard, which suggests a stringed instrument with a fingerboard. Of the options given, only the lute, guitar, banjo, mandolin, and violin are stringed instruments, but only the violin has a fingerboard. Additionally, the violin was a popular instrument during the medieval period, making it a likely choice for the musician in question.
leg cramps | Knowledge: The question suggests that going for a run too many times can have negative consequences on the body, specifically related to the legs. Leg cramps are a common issue for runners who overexert their muscles and do not properly stretch or rest. Becoming tired and muscles are also possible outcomes of running too much, but they are not as specific to the legs as leg cramps. Trip and feeling refreshed are not logical outcomes of running too much, based on the context of the question.
tornado | Knowledge: A tornado is a natural disaster that can cause high-speed winds and can pick up objects and hurl them through the air. Furniture can become a projectile in a tornado as it is lifted off the ground and carried by the wind. The other options (canon, baseball, battle field, war zone) do not provide any context that suggests how furniture could become a projectile.
mountainous area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is in a mountainous area and is chopping fuel for a fire. When they see a marmot, they would likely release it in its natural habitat, which in this case would be the mountains. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context or behavior of marmots.
missile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a weapon that has the specific capability of targeting the nose of an aircraft. This narrows down the choices to options that are weapons and can target a specific part of an aircraft. Out of these options, the only weapon that can specifically target a part of an aircraft is a missile. The other options are not weapons or do not have the capability of targeting a specific part of an aircraft.
headache | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending too much time contemplating something can lead to a negative outcome, specifically a type of pain. The options "relaxation" and "deciding" do not fit with this negative connotation, and "regret" also doesn't make sense as a result of merely contemplating something. "Revelations" could potentially fit, but it is not typically associated with pain. The remaining option, "headache," is a well-known effect of prolonged mental strain or excessive thinking, making it the correct option.
erase | Knowledge: The verb "burned" suggests that they destroyed the record intentionally, and the phrase "trying to do what to history" implies that it was an attempt to alter or erase history. The other options -- compact disc, tape, rewrite, and play music -- do not fit the context of the sentence and are not activities that would be associated with altering history.
feel better | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the released patient had been in the hospital for a while and was feeling unwell. Breathing fresh air suggests that the patient was outside, which could have helped them feel better. The other options do not necessarily suggest an improvement in the patient's health or well-being.
office building | Knowledge: Dentist offices are often located in office buildings, as these offer a professional atmosphere and convenient location for patients. Hospitals may have dental clinics, but they are typically located within the hospital complex and may not be accessible to the general public. Shopping malls and streets are also unlikely locations for a dental practice, as they do not offer the necessary privacy and infrastructure for medical procedures. The location of Minnesota is not relevant to the context of the question.
flowerpot | Knowledge: The word "ficus" refers to a type of houseplant, which is commonly grown in flowerpots indoors. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as a farm or arboretum are outdoor locations and the plant kingdom and science class are not specific enough to suggest where a ficus would be grown.
hunt for food | Knowledge: The sentence tells us that the neolithic person was hungry, which suggests that they needed to find a way to obtain food. Out of the given choices, "hunt for food" is the most logical solution to this problem. In prehistoric times, hunting and gathering were the primary ways of obtaining food, so it makes sense that this would be the neolithic person's solution. The other options do not provide a practical solution to the problem of hunger.
car | Knowledge: The phrase "just a few passengers" suggests a small vehicle, which points to the option of a car. Transportation and vehicle are general terms that can refer to any mode of transportation, and bus depot and train station both suggest larger modes of transportation that would accommodate more passengers. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a car.
reconciled | Knowledge: Christianity teaches that believers can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus Christ, and that death is not the end, but a transition to eternal life with God. Therefore, a Christian is likely to feel reconciled, or at peace, about their death if they believe in Jesus Christ. The other options do not align with Christian beliefs about death.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of closing one's eyes while resting is associated with a positive feeling. The other choices are not consistent with this context. Laziness, falling asleep, and laying down all suggest a lack of activity or productivity. "Feel better" is too vague and could apply to a number of scenarios, while relaxation is the most likely answer as it implies a sense of comfort and calmness.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: A medicine cabinet or medicine chest is typically where people store personal hygiene products such as deodorant, as well as other health and beauty items like toothbrushes, razors, and medications. The other options, such as using a spray or keeping it in the shower, do not make as much sense because they may decrease the shelf-life or effectiveness of the product. Keeping deodorant in one's own bathroom is plausible, but the most commonly associated storage location is the medicine cabinet or medicine chest.
punch | Knowledge: The question is asking what someone expressing anger will shake their fists to do, and the most common action associated with shaking fists in anger is punching. Other options like twerking, illustrating a point, cooling off, or writing a letter do not have any direct association with shaking fists in anger.
express emotion | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person created music to share how they felt with another, which suggests that their goal was to convey their emotions through music. The option "express emotion" is the only one that aligns with this idea. The other options do not match the context of the sentence, for example, "quiet mind" and "beautiful" do not relate to creating music to share emotions. "Boredom" and "irritate" have a negative connotation, which seems unlikely to be the intended goal of the person creating the music.
persona | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is putting on a performance when interacting with customers in her sales job, despite feeling tired. The word "persona" refers to an individual's public image or the personality they present to others, which fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options (smile, laugh, act, singing) could also be possible answers, but they do not capture the full extent of what the person is doing in their sales job.
edible | Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes food that can be consumed without causing harm or discomfort. The term "edible" specifically refers to food that is safe and suitable for consumption. The other options do not accurately describe food that is safe for consumption. "Spoiled" implies that the food is rotten or inedible, "necessary to live" describes a basic need that food fulfills, "supermarket" is a place where food is sold, but it doesn't indicate whether the food is safe to eat or not, and "unhealthy" describes the quality of the food, but again, not its edibility.
toolbox | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that saws were in high demand, and that people needed them frequently. It also implies that people had a specific place where they stored their saws. A "toolbox" is a common place to store tools like saws, and it makes sense that people would have their own personal boxes to house their own tools. The other options, such as "hospital," "logging camp," and "basement," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
acting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is not actually crying but pretending to do so. In this context, the term "act" means to pretend, and it is often used when referring to someone who is pretending to be a character or emotion that they are not actually feeling. Yelling, getting injured, being hurt, or being miserable are unrelated to the context of pretending to cry.
driving | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police witnessed a car that was in motion, indicating that the suspect was driving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
purse | Knowledge: The question mentions that the person is not a man, which indicates that they likely carry a purse or some type of bag with them. The question also suggests that the change will be used soon, which means it needs to be easily accessible. Putting change in a wardrobe or backseat of a car would not be practical as it would be difficult to access when needed. A jar is not a common place to store change outside of a home or office, so the most practical option is to put the change in a purse.
losing | Knowledge: The question is asking about the negative aspect of playing games, and losing is a common frustration that many people experience when playing games. Learning may also be challenging, but it is not necessarily the "worst" part for everyone. Happiness and competition are positive aspects and do not fit the question's premise. Fatigue may be a physical challenge, but it is not necessarily the worst part of playing games for everyone.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother's desired destination is associated with peace and quiet. Home is a common place where people seek refuge and relaxation, making it the best fit for the context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
could | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting wet could potentially lead to drowning, but it does not state it as a certain outcome. "Could" indicates possibility or probability, making it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning conveyed in the sentence.
fast food restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to get coffee without leaving their car, which is commonly offered at fast food restaurants through their drive-thru service. Gas stations and supermarkets may have coffee available for purchase, but they may not offer it in a way that allows the person to stay in their car. Grocery stores and friend's houses are unlikely places to stop for coffee if the person is looking for convenience.
mall | Knowledge: The sentence describes a storey (or level) that contains multiple small restaurants. This is a common feature of a mall, which often has multiple levels with a variety of stores and restaurants. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. City halls typically contain government offices, an apartment building usually contains residential units, and a book of stories is a literary work, not a physical structure. Tall building is too broad and does not provide enough information.
irreverence  | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James had a deep respect and admiration for Bill, but Bill did not reciprocate these feelings. The word "religious" suggests that James held Bill in very high regard, possibly even idolizing him. The word "reverence" reinforces this idea, as it means deep respect or admiration. The word "irreverence" is the opposite of reverence, indicating a lack of respect or disrespect, and therefore is the correct answer. The other options (profanity, content, blasphemy, contempt) do not accurately reflect how Bill treated James in the sentence.
belief | Knowledge: A synonym is a word that has a similar meaning to another word. In this case, the word "faith" means a strong belief in something, often without proof or evidence. The word "belief" also means a strong conviction or acceptance that something is true or real, and is therefore a good synonym for "faith." The other options do not have the same meaning as "faith" or are expressions that are used in a different context.
tree | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to the tallest plant found on Earth, and trees are the most common type of plant that can grow to great heights. Other options like orbit, pressure, space, and solar system are not related to the context of the question and are therefore incorrect.
sleep in | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is staying in bed during the weekend, which is often associated with taking advantage of the opportunity to sleep longer than usual. "Sleep in" refers to sleeping later than one normally would, and is a common reason why people may stay in bed on the weekend. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rest area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where someone can take a break from driving and relax, which is a common feature of rest areas. Rest areas typically have amenities such as restrooms, picnic tables, and benches for travelers to use while taking a break from the road. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
heavy | Knowledge: Motorcycles are generally lighter than cars, which allows them to be more agile and accelerate more quickly. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
muttering | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James is typically good at expressing himself, but on this particular occasion, he was struggling to communicate. The word "eloquent" suggests that James has a way with words, while "muttering" implies that he was struggling to articulate his thoughts. The other options (speechless, voiceless, screaming, stumbling) do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not describe someone who is trying to speak but having difficulty doing so.
Mississippi | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a place that could be abbreviated as "Jackson" but there would be a missing or incomplete reference if you did so. Mississippi is commonly associated with the city of Jackson, which is the state capital and a major metropolitan area. If you called the place "Jackson" for short, you would be leaving out the state name and therefore not providing a complete reference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pots | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a way to grow a ficus on their patio. The options "tropical forest" and "arboretum" refer to natural environments and do not provide any guidance on how to grow a plant in a specific location. "Soil" is important for growing plants, but it is not a suitable answer for this question because the speaker is looking for a container to grow the ficus in. "Large pot" is a more specific answer than "pots" and may be correct in some cases, but the size of the pot depends on the size of the plant and the space available on the patio. Therefore, the best answer is "pots," which suggests that the speaker should consider using multiple containers to grow the ficus on their patio.
drugstore | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the word "diaphragm" refers to a form of birth control that is designed to be inserted into a woman's body. Therefore, the answer must be a location where a diaphragm would not be found if there is no one to insert it. A drugstore sells various forms of birth control, so it is not a viable option. The other options are all related to the human body, which is where a diaphragm would be found.
math | Knowledge: The question is asking about a situation where students may have to attend more than one period, which typically refers to different class periods throughout the day. The option "math" is the most likely choice, as many schools have multiple periods for math classes due to the importance of the subject and the need for extra instruction time. The other options do not have any relevance to the context of the question.
get laid | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was actively seeking sexual activity with a man. The phrases "determined" and "flirt" imply that she is focused on achieving this objective, and the options "get in bed" and "have sex" are also synonymous with this goal. "Attract attention" and "train" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not imply a desire for sexual activity.
cemetary | Knowledge: A monument is typically a structure or statue that is erected in memory of a person who has passed away. In most cases, monuments are placed in cemeteries where the individual is buried. This is because cemeteries are typically places of mourning and reflection, making them an appropriate location for a memorial. The other choices do not fit the context as they are not typically associated with monuments or memorials.
bar | Knowledge: Bars are establishments that serve alcoholic beverages, making them the most logical choice for businesses that serve liquor. Fraternity houses may serve beer or other beverages, but they are not typically licensed to serve liquor. Cabinets are furniture pieces, and State Farm is an insurance company. Soft drinks do not contain alcoholic content, so they cannot be considered as businesses that serve liquor.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the house is located in a remote area and not connected to any other buildings or infrastructure, which means that it would need a street to allow visitors to access it. A street provides a pathway and connection to other areas, which is necessary for visitors to reach the house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as a city, residential area, subdivision, or milk man would not necessarily help visitors access the house.
diverse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the world is home to many different types of people and places, which points to the idea of diversity. Additionally, the use of the word "big" implies that the world is extensive and encompasses a lot of different things, another aspect of diversity. The other options, such as "complicated" or "square," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
old west | Knowledge: The items listed are commonly associated with the time period of the Old West, such as whiskey and saddles for cowboys and grain for agriculture. The general store was a common fixture of towns during this time period, which sold a variety of goods including these items. The other options, such as a shopping mall or meat store, do not fit the context of the question and are not associated with the Old West.
active | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that engaging in a certain activity will cause the individual to need a rest. Being active, or engaging in physical activity, is a common cause of fatigue and the need for rest. Paying debts and wakefulness do not necessarily require physical exertion, while resthold and in motion are not commonly used terms and do not provide clear context to the sentence.
expense | Knowledge: The sentence makes it clear that the company was concerned about profit, which suggests they were looking to cut something that was costing them money. Expenses are costs associated with running a business, so it makes sense that they would be the target of the cost-cutting measures. "Losses", "losing money", and "lose money" all refer to the same thing and could be considered redundant answers. "Eat cake" is a nonsensical option that does not relate to the context of the sentence.
ceiling | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something in the building is located at a significant height from the ground floor. This would usually be the ceiling of the building, which is above all the floors and can be very far from the ground level. The other options do not make sense in this context - the basement is usually below the ground floor, air and water do not have a specific height, and the sky is outside the building.
attempt to fly | Knowledge: Fish are not capable of flying, and it is unlikely that they would intentionally flap their fins in the air unless they were attempting to jump or escape from a predator. This suggests that the correct answer is "attempt to fly." The other options, such as "school together" or "hatred," do not make sense in the context of a fish flapping its fins in the air.
pond | Knowledge: This question refers to the phenomenon of throwing a pebble into a body of water to create ripples. Cups and aquariums are too small to create noticeable ripples, while playgrounds and lakes are too large. A pond is a smaller body of water that is large enough to create noticeable ripples when a pebble is thrown into it, making it the correct answer.
meeting | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the boss asked the person to speak to a group that same afternoon. The word "meeting" is the only choice that fits this context, as all the others imply a different audience or setting. A "university" or "class" would suggest a more formal or educational environment, while an "office party" or "book" would imply a more casual or festive atmosphere. Therefore, "meeting" is the most fitting answer.
garage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tool is related to a car since it is stored in the same place as the car. The most logical option would be the garage, which is where cars are typically stored. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
muscles | Knowledge: Lifting weights is a common exercise for building muscle. Muscles are the primary focus of weightlifting, and in order to gain muscle mass, one must consistently lift weights and challenge their body. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of lifting weights; breaths and shortness of breath are related to cardio exercises, effort is required in any exercise, and discipline is a personal trait that can be applied to any activity.
shattering | Knowledge: The word "hit" suggests forceful impact, which would cause glass to shatter rather than melt. Glass that has been hit is likely to have sharp, jagged edges and not easily hold water. While glass can come in many different colors, this information is not relevant to the context of the question.
fart | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bad smell is causing someone to want to leave and the word "fart" specifically refers to a bodily function that can produce an unpleasant odor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A rose bush, for example, is unlikely to emit a strong odor that would make someone want to leave, and "go back," "die," and "arrive there" are not related to the topic of bad smells.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was uncomfortable due to the stuffy environment and decided to breathe fresh air instead. Breathing fresh air would provide relief from the discomfort caused by the stuffy environment, making the person feel better. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
longer lines | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a line and the more people who join the line, the result is (blank). Longer lines make sense in this context because a greater number of people would mean that the line would become longer. The other options do not make as much sense in this context.
torture | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the interrogators resorted to extreme measures to get the information they needed from the prisoner. The phrase "least human thing" implies that the action was cruel and inhumane, which rules out options like "better himself" and "think and reason". "Have fever" does not make sense in this context, leaving "hurt" and "torture" as the only plausible options. However, since the sentence specifies that they "began to", it is more likely that the correct answer is "torture" as this suggests a prolonged and intentional action rather than a one-time act of violence.
person | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a characteristic of a heart, which typically refers to the organ that pumps blood throughout the body. While all mammals do have hearts, the use of "characteristically" suggests that the answer is more specific. Dogs, artichokes, and hospitals do not have hearts in the traditional sense, so those options can be eliminated. Therefore, the answer is person, since people are the only option that typically possess a heart as an organ.
sore feet | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "narrow halls," which suggests that visitors may have to walk through cramped and uncomfortable spaces. Walking for an extended period of time in narrow halls can cause physical discomfort and result in sore feet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
productivity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah was a successful saleswoman, but despite her achievements, she was never recognized for something specific. The word "acknowledge" implies that there was some sort of recognition or reward that Sarah deserved but did not receive. Based on the context, it seems like Sarah's lack of recognition was not related to her ability to work hard or sell products (which she was already successful at), but rather something that had to do with her overall output or productivity. The other options do not seem to fit the context as well.
internet | Knowledge: The use of the word "nowadays" suggests that the answer relates to modern times. The other options, such as books and manuals, imply traditional forms of information gathering that are becoming increasingly less common in the digital age. "Online" is a synonym for the internet, so it is possible that it could be a correct answer. "Meeting" does not relate to information gathering at all and is therefore an unlikely answer.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James watches films as a way to alleviate his high-strung state. This implies that he may be looking for a way to unwind and relax, making "relaxation" the most appropriate answer. The other options do not accurately reflect James' motivation for watching films.
warm house | Knowledge: The context of the sentence is that Bob is lighting a fire in the wood stove in the winter. This implies that he wants to stay warm since winters can be cold. Out of the given options, only "warm house" suits the context of the sentence. The other choices such as "emit light" or "boil water" do not relate to the idea of keeping warm in wintertime.
reverse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim made a mistake while driving which caused him to hit a car. The clue to identifying the correct answer is that Jim mistook forward for something else, indicating that he may have been in the wrong gear. Reverse is the option that makes the most sense in this context as it is the opposite of forward and commonly used when driving a car in the opposite direction. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
step down |  | Knowledge: The question suggests that a leader has committed crimes against their people, which implies that they are no longer fit to rule. Stepping down from power would be the most appropriate course of action in this scenario. The other choices do not address the issue of the leader's moral failing and the need for them to relinquish their position of authority.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a place has stopped giving out plastic shopping bags, which is a common practice in grocery stores. Grocery stores are often considered the primary source of plastic bag waste, and many have taken steps to reduce or eliminate their use of plastic bags in recent years. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
son's room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person who spent all summer playing video games was the son. Therefore, it would not be surprising for his mother to find dirty dishes in his room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lose weight | Knowledge: The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Jogging is a physical activity that can help burn calories and promote weight loss, making it a common reason why people decide to start jogging. The other options, such as suicide, blisters, sweating, and shortness of breath, are not typical motivations for starting a new exercise routine.
hollowness | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James believed the desk was well-built and sturdy, but when he rapped on it, he could hear something that contradicts this. The word "hollowness" suggests that the desk has empty space inside, possibly indicating that it is not as solid as James originally thought. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
nature | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the objects listed are part of something larger or more abstract. The term "nature" is commonly used to describe the world around us, including plants and animals. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they refer to specific locations or things that are not relevant to the objects listed.
invisible | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the clarity of the class made it almost "invisible," indicating that the information presented was easy to understand and comprehend. The other choices all suggest a lack of clarity or understanding, which contradicts the idea that the class was clear.
unfinished | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the mayor wanted the road to be "complete," suggesting that it was still under construction or not yet fully built. The adjective "frustrated" further implies that there were obstacles or difficulties preventing the completion of the road, which could be indicative of it being unfinished. The other options do not accurately convey the sense of incompleteness or frustration suggested in the sentence.
control panel | Knowledge: The clue "knob" suggest a physical control mechanism, and "emits light and sound" suggests that it is some sort of electronic device. Control panels can feature knobs or buttons and often emit visual and auditory signals, making it the most likely answer. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context provided in the question.
fruit basket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy loves grapes and similar foods, which implies that the gift his friends bought him is likely to contain a variety of fruits, such as apples, oranges, and bananas, in addition to grapes. A fruit basket is a common gift that contains a variety of fruits, making it the most likely option. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cough | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the doctor noticed a problem with the patient's lung based on a specific symptom related to breathing. The fact that the patient was coughing every time they breathed suggests that something was obstructing the airway or causing irritation in the lung. The other options all relate to general breathing actions and do not necessarily indicate a problem with the lung in particular.
football stadium | Knowledge: The sentence includes specific information about a game where large men in pads run and smash into each other. This is a clear reference to American football, which is commonly played in stadiums. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Success | Knowledge: The word "competition" implies a goal-oriented activity in which individuals or teams strive to perform their best in order to achieve success. "Jealousy" and "enemies" are negative emotions and not productive goals in a competition. "Wins" and "losing" are possible outcomes of the competition, but they are not goals. "Success" reflects the positive outcome of the competition and is the most appropriate answer to the question.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The question asks where personal mushrooms can be kept fresh, implying that mushrooms are perishable and need to be stored properly to maintain their freshness. Of the choices given, only the refrigerator is a common method of storing fresh produce. The other options are not related to mushroom storage or food preservation.
There is no clear answer provided in the sentence.
printed word | Knowledge: Typing involves pressing keys on a keyboard to input text into a document or program. Therefore, the most likely thing you would be creating while typing is a printed word, such as a document, email, or report. A letter or birthday card could also be created through typing, but these are more specific examples. Pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are not things that are typically associated with typing, but rather potential negative consequences if proper ergonomic techniques are not used.
chewing | Knowledge: Chewing is a necessary part of the digestion process that breaks down food to make it easier for the body to absorb nutrients. Drinking while eating can sometimes interfere with this process, and watching TV or talking can distract from the act of eating and make it more difficult to focus on chewing properly. Therefore, chewing is the most appropriate answer.
public place | Knowledge: Fountains are often found in public places such as parks, plazas, and other outdoor areas where people gather. They are a common feature in urban environments and are often used as decorative elements or to provide a source of water for people and animals. Courtyards are also a possible location for fountains, but they are not as common as public places. The other options, such as city, Rome, or police station, are too general or specific to be the correct answer.
sweat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two teams were engaged in intense physical activity, as indicated by the phrase "competing out there." Additionally, the phrase "had all worked up" implies that they had become physically exerted, which leads to sweating. None of the other choices necessarily indicate physical activity or exertion.
shake hands | Knowledge: The question is asking about what comes after verbal agreement on a deal, which is likely to involve some gesture or action to solidify the agreement. Shaking hands is a common way to signal a formal agreement or deal, and is often seen as a symbolic representation of trust and mutual respect between parties. Expressing agreement or nodding are more general gestures that may not specifically indicate a formal agreement or deal, while 'concordance' and 'gendering' do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
hospital or doctor's office | Knowledge: Thermometers are commonly used in medical settings to measure body temperature. They are also used in hospitals and doctor's offices for diagnostic purposes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
casino | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the focus is on betting on cards in various games, which would typically occur in a gambling setting such as a casino. A toy store is unlikely to have gambling-related items, while the terms "table" and "table play" are too vague to indicate a specific location. "Deck" is also too general and could refer to any location where cards are sold or used.
All of the options are possible places to have a cemetery, but the most common options are bury loved ones, churchyard, and populated areas. Cemeteries are often located near residential areas or near religious institutions, such as churches or temples. In many cultures, it is customary to bury the dead in a designated cemetery or graveyard, which can be located in various places including rural areas or urban centers. Therefore, any of the options listed could potentially be a correct answer to this question.
San Diego  | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Navy ships, which suggests that the location is a naval port. San Diego is a well-known naval port in California, which is also close to the Mexican border. Additionally, the sentence mentions an "authentic Mexican restaurant," which further supports the idea that the location is in San Diego since it has a large Mexican population and is known for its Mexican food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
village | Knowledge: Open air markets are typically associated with smaller, more rural communities like villages. These markets often sell locally grown produce and homemade goods, which are more commonly found in rural areas where farming and small-scale production is more prevalent. While it is possible to find open air markets in cities, they are usually smaller and more specialized. The other options, like field or buy fresh vegetables, do not necessarily suggest the presence of an open air market.
being full  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consequence of eating too much food is being full, which is a normal physiological response to satiety. Laziness, weight gain, and getting fat are potential long-term consequences of overeating if it becomes a habit, but they do not necessarily occur immediately after a single episode of overeating. "Will not starve" is not a consequence of overeating but rather the opposite, emphasizing that the person will have enough food to sustain them.
use drugs | Knowledge: The other options in the choices are generally considered good or positive things. "Make friends" and "learn from each other" are social and personal development activities that most people would consider to be beneficial. "Stand upright" is a physical posture that is generally seen as healthy and desirable. "Donate to charity" is an act of philanthropy that is typically viewed positively. In contrast, "use drugs" is often seen as a bad thing because it can have negative health effects, lead to addiction, and cause social and personal problems.
vagina | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that a condom is specifically designed for use on a penis as a form of contraceptive. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the answer choice for diaphragm should also refer to a body part related to contraception. The vagina is a common site for contraceptive devices and is often associated with the use of a diaphragm. The other options are not related to contraception or reproductive health.
clean | Knowledge: The sentence clearly indicates that the stack of dishes is dirty and high. This suggests that they need to be cleaned, as leaving them in their current state would result in unhygienic conditions. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
guard tower | Knowledge: The phrase "stand watch" suggests a guarding or monitoring activity, which is commonly associated with a guard tower. The other options (department store, bathroom cabinet, bedroom drawer, jewellers) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: The phrase "morning pill" suggests that the pill is part of a daily medication routine, which is often stored in a designated place like a medicine cabinet. The other options are not typically associated with daily medication routines and would not be logical places to look for a morning pill.
kitchen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that food is the likely culprit for clogging plumbing in a specific location. The options of bathroom, wall, oil refineries, and water park all do not have a strong association with food or plumbing. However, kitchens are where food is prepared and disposed of, which makes it likely that food could accidentally get into the plumbing and cause a clog.
cutting grass | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sound of a lawnmower is heard from across the street, which indicates that someone is currently mowing their lawn. The other options (shed, garage, neighbor's house) do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they are not related to the activity of cutting grass. The option lawn is tempting because it is related to cutting grass, but it does not answer the question about the location of the lawnmower.
flower shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Rita enjoyed the taste of a specific type of plant called anemone, which is commonly found in flower shops as a type of decorative flower. The other options, such as a neighbor's house or a seafood restaurant, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with the taste of anemone.
england | Knowledge: William the Conqueror is known for crossing the English Channel to invade and conquer England in 1066. The other options do not have any relevance to this historical event.
accidents | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that drinking alcohol can have negative consequences. The phrase "in addition to making you sick" implies that there are other negative effects that result from drinking alcohol. One common consequence of drinking alcohol is impaired judgment and coordination, which can lead to accidents while driving or participating in other activities. The other options do not make logical sense as potential consequences of drinking alcohol.
having dinner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is cooking towards the end of the day, which is a common time for people to prepare their evening meal, also known as dinner. "Having dinner" is also a common phrase used to refer to eating an evening meal. The other options do not make sense in the context of preparing food at the end of the day.
daydream | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill was often bored and would stare off. Daydreaming is a common activity for people who are bored and have nothing else to occupy their minds. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - Bill wouldn't be working if he was bored, and seeing visions is unlikely unless he has a medical condition. Fiddling, playing games and dreaming are also possible activities for someone who is bored, but daydreaming seems to fit the context better.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: A saltshaker is a commonly used item in the kitchen, specifically for seasoning food. When it's not in use, it's typically stored in a convenient location within the kitchen, such as a cupboard or on a countertop. The other options are less likely to be the correct answer because an empty restaurant or table setting would not be the appropriate place to store a personal item like a saltshaker, and a cruet is a separate item used for storing and pouring liquids, not dry seasonings like salt.
white house | Knowledge: Soldiers may be honored in various ways, but being honored at the White House is a commonly known tradition in the United States. The President of the United States often presents medals for valor and bravery to soldiers at the White House. The other options are not typically associated with formal military honors.
pizza parlor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place where you get round food has a baking oven, which is sometimes made of brick. This is a common feature in pizza parlors, which use brick ovens to bake their pizzas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
shelf | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the poster was most likely hanging on a wall or standing on a flat surface in the kitchen. Out of the choices provided, the most likely place for a poster to be hung or placed in a kitchen would be a shelf. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a poster is unlikely to be placed in a closet or a fridge, and it would be unusual to have a poster stored in a drawer. A poster could potentially be placed on a table, but it is less likely than being on a shelf.
legal | Knowledge: The question is asking about a reason to pay your television bill, which implies that not paying the bill may have legal consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is "legal." The other choices -- informative, dead, entertaining, obsolete -- are irrelevant to the question and do not relate to reasons why someone would need to pay their television bill.
restitution | Knowledge: Civil action typically involves seeking compensation or resolution for a dispute or harm done to someone, rather than criminal charges that could result in jail time. Restitution, which involves payment or compensation to the harmed party, is a common outcome of civil action. The other options are not typically associated with civil action.
clothing store | Knowledge: The word "clothes" in the question indicates that the answer should be a place where one can buy clothing. A "house" is a place where someone lives and is unlikely to sell clothes. Similarly, a "bedroom" is a room in a house and not a place to buy clothes. A "toy store" sells toys and not clothes. A "mall" is a large shopping center that typically has many stores, including clothing stores, making it a possible answer. However, "clothing store" is the most specific and accurate answer as it directly refers to a store that specializes in selling clothes.
tears | Knowledge: When people get divorced, it is common for them to experience emotional distress such as grief, sadness, or anger. This can lead to a lot of crying and the need for tissues. The other options don't have a clear connection to divorce. Freedom might be a positive outcome of a divorce, but it's not something someone "produces". Richer is unlikely, as divorce often involves dividing assets. Depression may be a consequence of divorce, but it's not something someone "produces".
meet interesting people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person went to the bar to alleviate their boredom and found many characters there. Meeting interesting people is a common reason for going out to social places like bars. Playing games, skateboarding, and listening to music are activities that may not be common in bars, and the word "field" has no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
law office | Knowledge: The term "ambulance chasing" is commonly used to refer to lawyers who aggressively seek out clients for personal injury lawsuits. This suggests that the man in the sentence likely worked in a law office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
possibility | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there was a change in the scientists' initial belief due to new evidence. The word "impossibility" indicates that the scientists initially believed something could not happen. However, the phrase "new evidence" implies that their belief changed. The word "possibility" is the most likely choice as it indicates that there is now some chance that the previously deemed impossible event may occur. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not signify a change in the scientists' belief.
special | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kids had low self-esteem and did not believe they were exceptional in any way. However, the teacher's statement contradicts this and implies that each child has unique qualities that make them special. The word "special" is commonly used in this context to encourage and motivate children. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hikers were concerned about the safety of the water they would encounter on their hike, which is why they brought a filtering straw. The context of the sentence implies that the hikers wanted to purify the water they drank to avoid getting sick. Therefore, the correct answer is water. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was in a temporary lodging, specifically a hotel room, where he placed an unfamiliar item on the night table. The other options do not make sense in this context. He is unlikely to be in jail or a furniture store, while hallway and even homes do not provide enough information to be definitive.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the townhouse in question is not attached to other houses, which is a characteristic commonly associated with standalone structures such as those found in parks. It is unlikely that an apartment building would have single unattached townhouses, and suburban developments and suburbs typically have attached or semi-attached townhouses as part of larger developments. Michigan is a state and therefore does not have a townhouse, and there is no clear indication that the townhouse is located in a suburban development.
happiness or may laugh | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob is enjoying his time with Bill and is likely feeling happy. This can be inferred from the phrase "having fun." Additionally, the option "may laugh" could also be a valid answer, since laughter is often associated with feelings of happiness and enjoyment. The other options, such as "accident" or "stress relief," do not align with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct answers.
bookstore | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James's workplace has new releases and bestsellers, which are typically associated with bookstores. Additionally, the fact that James has leisure time to browse these titles suggests that he works in a relatively quiet environment, which is also a common characteristic of bookstores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
detestable | Knowledge: The language in the question suggests that the act of killing a large number of people is morally repugnant or detestable. The word "detestable" means deserving intense dislike or hatred, which is an appropriate term for describing someone who has committed such a heinous act. The other options do not have any clear relation to the context of the question.
airport | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James needs to find his return ticket before he leaves for his next destination. The options "home," "tickets," and "pocket" do not make sense in this context because James is already at the hotel and is clearly searching for something specific. "Plane" could be a possible answer, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that James needs to find his ticket before boarding the plane. "Airport" makes the most sense because it is the most likely place for James to leave from to return to his destination.
the desert | Knowledge: The desert is known for its arid conditions and lack of water, which would make it the most likely place for a rosebush to die due to lack of water. The other options do not have the same association with dryness and lack of water.
four legs | Knowledge: Cats are known to have four legs, which are used for walking, running, jumping, and other forms of movement. While they also have other appendages such as tails and whiskers, these are not considered limbs or legs. Eyes are sensory organs, not limbs, and cats typically have two of them. Paws are the fleshy parts at the end of the legs that provide support and traction, but they are not separate appendages in themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is four legs.
national park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the landmark is located in an area surrounded by many miles of plants, which is a characteristic commonly associated with national parks. National parks are often designated to preserve and protect natural environments, which may explain why the area around the landmark is filled with plants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being awake | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about driving safely at night. Being awake and alert while driving is crucial to ensuring safety on the road, especially at night when visibility may be reduced. The other options, such as having a car or vehicle, are necessary to drive, but do not directly relate to driving safely at night. Distractions and napping are potential hazards to safe driving, and should be avoided while driving.
desk drawer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed to sign some papers and retrieved their fountain pen from a specific location. The options "calligrapher's hand," "shirt pocket," and "portfolio" do not make sense in the context of retrieving a pen. "Blotter" is not a location where someone would typically store a pen. This leaves "desk drawer" as the most likely option, as it is a common place to keep writing instruments.
care about | Knowledge: The question is asking about emotions people feel towards someone they love. Love is often associated with caring and devotion, which suggests that "care about" is the most appropriate answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of love or emotions towards a person.
learning new skills | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sarah went to school to become a nurse, which suggests that she has already acquired some skills in providing assistance to people. However, to better help people, the sentence implies that Sarah needs to continually improve her skills by learning new ones. The other options do not match the context of the sentence – "people helped" and "better circumstances" suggest outcomes rather than specific actions, "practice" may relate to skill-building but lacks the implication of seeking out new knowledge, and "happiness" is not clearly connected to the idea of providing assistance.
south | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah was cooking authentic soul food, which is a cuisine commonly associated with the southern United States. The option "boil vegetables" does not provide any information about Sarah's location or cuisine, while "kitchen cupboard" and "Italian restaurant" are unlikely to be connected to southern soul food. Therefore, "south" is the most likely answer.
raise hell | Knowledge: The phrase "raise hell" typically refers to someone causing a disturbance or creating chaos, which would be in line with someone who is drunk and angry. The other options don't fit the context as well - appearing ridiculous, throwing up, and walking off may be potential consequences of being drunk, but they don't necessarily involve the person taking action against others. Fighting could be a possibility, but "raise hell" is a more appropriate phrase to use in this context.
clean clothes | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the man wanted to clean his clothes, indicating that his main goal was to have clean garments. While having clean clothes may lead to a more attractive appearance, this is not the specific goal mentioned in the sentence. "Sanitation" is a more general term that does not match the context of the sentence, and "laundromat" is a location rather than a goal or outcome.
chicken coop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel was scavenging on a farmer's land in the winter, which implies that it was searching for food. Chicken coops are common on farms and are often visited by predators looking for a meal. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, with the exception of the great outdoors, which is too general and does not provide any specific information.
neighbor's yard | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Joe crossed a property boundary, which implies that he left his own property and entered someone else's. If he ran into a rosebush, it is likely that the bush was located in the neighbor's yard, which is a common place to find plants and landscaping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
u.s | Knowledge: The bald eagle is a well-known symbol of the United States and is often associated with patriotism and national identity. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the bald eagle or its symbolism. Canada also uses the bald eagle as a symbol, but it is not as commonly associated with that country as it is with the U.S.
nodding or shaking hand | Knowledge: Nodding and shaking hands are commonly known as signs of agreement or approval in business deals or negotiations. While nodding signifies agreement, shaking hands is a gesture of mutual respect and signifies a successful agreement. Lying, whistling, or nodding and smiling may not be appropriate or recognized gestures for indicating agreement in a business context.
street | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a physical divider between two buildings that cars drive on. Sidewalks are typically located next to buildings and are not meant for cars, while a fork in the road would generally lead to different directions rather than dividing two buildings. A living room and binder are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is street.
god's creation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people who gather together on Sundays share a belief about the origin of the Earth. The phrase "God's creation" refers to the belief that the Earth was created by a higher power or deity, which is a common belief in many religions. The other options are either scientific descriptions or not related to the context of the sentence.
outside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to have a picnic outside because he doesn't want to buy food from a restaurant. The option "addidas" is a brand of clothing and not related to the context of the sentence. "North America" is a continent and not a location suitable for a picnic. "Cafe" implies buying food from a restaurant, which Billy doesn't want to do. "Woodland" would not be a suitable location for Billy because he is allergic to trees and hates them. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside."
speed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving to work late can be unpleasant, but it implies that speeding is an inappropriate action to take. Speeding can be dangerous and can result in accidents or legal consequences. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cruise ship | Knowledge: Cruise ships are known for providing luxury experiences for their passengers, with extravagant dining areas being a common feature. The limited space on a ship also means that every area needs to be utilized to the fullest, with dining areas often taking up a significant portion of the ship's interior. In contrast, a home or restaurant may have limited space and resources for extravagant dining areas, while a mall or "coming together" are not typically associated with dining areas at all.
vomit | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person got drunk and is now refusing to get up off the floor because she thinks she might vomit again. The word "refused" suggests that she is resisting getting up, likely because she feels sick. The other options such as "walk", "staggering", and "fall down" don't fit the context of the sentence as they refer to movement rather than illness.
desk or table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object mentioned is something that can be used to prop up or elevate one's foot. Socks and shoes are worn on the feet, while a bar is not typically used for propping up feet. However, desks and tables are often used for this purpose, especially in a work or school setting where people may need to sit for extended periods of time.
none of the above | Knowledge: The sentence does not provide any indication of what happens when ships are in a storm and the sun comes out. The options provided are unrelated to the context of the sentence and cannot be chosen as the correct answer. It is important to carefully read and understand the context of the sentence in order to make an informed decision when choosing the correct answer.
in flower fields | Knowledge: Bees are known for pollinating flowers, so it makes sense that they would spend time traveling in areas where flowers are present. Flower fields and fields of flowers are both plausible options for this reason, while an orchard may not necessarily have as many flowers for the bees to visit. The sky and the United States are both unlikely answers as they do not relate to the behaviors of bees.
playing around | Knowledge: The phrase "having fun" suggests that the answer should be related to an activity that is enjoyable or entertaining. "Cleaning house" and "constructing" are unlikely to be associated with fun for most people. "Kiss" may be enjoyable for couples, but it is not necessarily an activity that they plan to do for fun. "Wild ride" could be interpreted in various ways, but "playing around" is a common expression for couples engaging in playful or flirtatious behavior.
Minnesota | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the location is known for its Vikings, which suggests that it is likely referring to a place with a strong Scandinavian heritage. Among the options provided, Minnesota fits this description the best, as it is home to many people of Norwegian and Swedish descent, and is also known for its Viking heritage, particularly in the city of Alexandria. The other options, such as California or England, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. The mention of the corner shop suggests that the location is a small, local establishment, which could be found on a street corner or at the corner of two streets.
space | Knowledge: The Milky Way is a term used to describe the galaxy in which our solar system resides. It is a vast, disc-shaped structure that contains billions of stars, dust, and gas. Therefore, the correct answer is "space." The other choices are either unrelated or do not make sense in the context of the question.
shaving kit | Knowledge: The sentence provides context clues that suggest that the item in question is related to shaving. The fact that it is described as a "double-edged razor" further confirms that it is a tool for grooming. The most logical option among the choices is the shaving kit, which is where one would typically store grooming tools such as razors. The other options (cricket ground, medicine cabinet, first aid kit, chemist) do not relate to shaving in any way, making them incorrect.
wings | Knowledge: Birds are known for having wings, which they use to fly. The sentence mentions that birds do not have arms, which is a characteristic that distinguishes them from mammals. The other options either do not relate to the anatomy of birds or are redundant (such as "ability to fly," which is already implied by the mention of wings).
successful in life | Knowledge: Going to school is often associated with obtaining an education or training that can lead to greater opportunities and success in life. While some individuals may go to school for socializing purposes, such as partying, the primary motivation for attending school is to gain knowledge and skills that can help one achieve their personal and professional goals. The other options, such as owning a house, having more leisure time, or not feeling pain, are not relevant factors in the decision to attend school.
move | Knowledge: The verb "walking" implies movement, so the correct answer should also relate to movement. "Exercise" is too broad and does not specifically describe what the body does while walking. "Getting somewhere" and "moving forward" are both correct, but "move" is the most general and accurate answer that encompasses all types of walking. "Keep moving forward" implies a specific direction, which is not necessarily true for all walks.
gain speed | Knowledge: Pressing a pedal in a car typically controls some aspect of the car's movement. In this case, the options "go forward," "rush away," and "go fast" all generally mean the same thing as "gain speed," but are less specific. "Suffer damage" does not accurately describe the effect of pressing a pedal, and is therefore not a correct answer.
bad | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man who owned a lot of guns did not agree with the idea of more gun control. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is the opposite of "a great idea" or "controlled in Canada," which suggests gun control is a positive thing. The option "semiautomatic" refers to a type of gun and is not related to the man's opinion. The option "very dangerous" also does not fit the sentence because it describes the guns, not the man's opinion.
dug | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there was a ruin located underneath the site, indicating that some sort of excavation or digging may have been done. Out of the options given, "dug" is the only one that fits with this context. "Produce," "construct," and "new construction" suggest building or creating something rather than excavating, and "found" suggests only discovering the ruin and not acting upon it.
bring | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Brian took a tool from a shelf without permission and the cashier noticed him doing so. The use of the word "as" implies that the cashier spoke to him immediately after he started to leave, which suggests that the cashier wanted him to return the tool to its rightful place on the shelf. The other options do not make sense in this context.
hands | Knowledge: The sentence states that James "punched a man again and again," indicating that he used his hands and fists to hit the other person. As a result, it makes sense that some blood would cover his hands, which were likely in close proximity to the man's nose during the altercation. The other options have little to do with the context or logic of the sentence, as they are more abstract or unrelated to physical actions.
grass | Knowledge: Apple trees need to be pollinated in order to create new trees. Pollinators such as bees and other insects are attracted to apple trees by the nectar produced by their flowers. In order for apple trees to produce more flowers and therefore more fruit, they need adequate nutrients and water, which are typically provided by healthy soil and sufficient irrigation. While a farm yard or farm-like setting may provide these conditions, the specific location options of New York or New Jersey do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
petty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had an important role or position, but when he was wronged, he could exhibit a negative trait. The word "petty" means to focus on small or insignificant details, which suggests that John may become irrationally fixated on minor wrongs or grievances. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe negative traits that John might exhibit when wronged.
wastebasket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the park was facing a problem with people leaving trash and litter around, and that they took measures to address this issue. The most logical solution would be to add more garbage cans or wastebaskets to the park, which would make it easier for visitors to dispose of their trash properly. The other options, such as a tip or incinerator, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence. A park officer could help enforce littering rules, but they would not directly address the problem of trash disposal.
listening to the radio | Knowledge: The sentence states that Dan is driving a car, which implies that he is in a moving vehicle. However, it also states that he is stopped at a light currently, which means he is not currently moving. Therefore, we can assume that the only other activity he could be doing at this moment is listening to the radio, as there is no information provided about a car crash, getting sleepy, or where he is going.
listening | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on what someone else does when someone is talking to them. The verb "talk" refers to speaking out loud, and the other options all suggest being silent or not interrupting, which is not specific enough to address the question. "Listening" is the best answer as it directly correlates to the act of someone speaking and someone else paying attention to what they are saying.
business district | Knowledge: The phrase "dressed in a suit" suggests a formal attire typically worn for business or professional settings. Therefore, the most likely option is a business district, which is an area with many office buildings and commercial activities. The other options do not necessarily require formal attire, and would not necessarily warrant wearing a suit to park your car.
person's head | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was trying to listen for the sound of a buffalo herd, which implies that they would need to use their sense of hearing. The most logical place for someone to use their ear to listen would be on their own head. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence or are nonsensical.
brushing | Knowledge: Grooming can refer to a variety of personal hygiene practices, including hair care. It is possible that excessive or aggressive brushing of the hair could lead to hair loss and bald spots. Brushing too hard can damage hair follicles or cause them to break, leading to hair loss. The other options do not have a clear connection to grooming causing bald spots.
prepare breakfast | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to eat breakfast, the person must enter the kitchen. If the kitchen is barren, then there is no food or cooking supplies available, which means the person would need to prepare breakfast themselves. The options "eat food" and "buy food" assume that there is already food available, which is not the case in the given context. "Open mouth" and "wake up" are irrelevant and do not relate to the situation described in the sentence.
petri dish | Knowledge: A petri dish is a common laboratory equipment used for growing bacteria. However, it is not a favorable place for bad bacteria as they are usually used to grow and study specific strains of bacteria. Sores, septic tanks, and mouths are all environments where bad bacteria can thrive and cause infections. Fingers can also harbor bad bacteria if proper hygiene is not practiced.
beef stew | Knowledge: In many cultures, potatoes are a common ingredient in beef stew. The combination of potatoes and beef creates a hearty and filling meal, and the potatoes absorb the flavors of the other vegetables and spices in the stew. Restaurants, steak houses and gardens do not provide any specific context related to mixing potatoes with other veggies, while cooking pot is a generic term that does not suggest any particular dish or recipe.
automobile | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is leaving to run an errand and needs to lock something up for security. The options house, garage, safe, and trunk are not relevant because they are likely to remain stationary while the person is out. The automobile, however, is something that the person is likely to take with them and leave parked somewhere, making it the most sensible choice for locking up when running an errand.
tidepools | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crab was in danger at the Tokyo fish market, which implies that people were trying to catch or sell it. Since crabs are aquatic animals, it is likely that it tried to escape into water. However, the last option, boiling water, is not a viable option for escape. The other options such as cold water, aquarium, and Pacific ocean are all types of water bodies, but the sentence specifically mentions that the crab ran away, which suggests it quickly moved away from the immediate vicinity. Tidepools are shallow pools of seawater that are often found on rocky coasts and can serve as a hiding place or shelter for small marine life, making it a logical choice for a crab to escape to in this scenario.
all of the above | Knowledge: Water can turn into all of the options listed. Ocean is a large body of saltwater, which is made up of water. Humidifiers turn water into a vapor that can be used to humidify the air. Ice cubes are made from freezing water. Water can drip from a faucet or a container. When water freezes on a surface, it can create a skating rink. Therefore, all of the options are correct.
water | Knowledge: Submarines are typically launched from a body of water, such as a harbor or a bay, because that is where they will be able to begin their underwater journey. Launching a submarine on land or from a shipyard would not be practical or efficient for this purpose. Additionally, using an ICBM missile to launch a submarine would not make sense, as the two are completely different types of weapons/systems.
study | Knowledge: Final exams are typically associated with the need to prepare and review material beforehand. Studying is the most common way to do this, and is widely known as the most effective way to improve test results. Sweating is not likely to help with exams, and cheating is unethical and can lead to serious consequences. Graduation is a separate event that occurs after exams are taken, and sleeping may be helpful in some cases but is not a guaranteed way to improve exam performance.
standing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that locking one's knees while standing may cause someone to faint or fall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, it is common knowledge that locking one's knees while standing for a long period of time can cause a decrease in blood flow and lead to fainting or falling.
interesting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone is deeply involved while watching a film, it means that the film is engaging and captivating. The word "deeply involved" implies that the person is emotionally invested in the story, which would only happen if the film is interesting. The other options do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection with the film or a high level of engagement.
little | Knowledge: The adjective "little" is often used to describe a younger sibling, indicating that the speaker had a good time with their younger brother. The other adjectives have negative connotations and would not be used to describe a positive experience, making "little" the most likely answer.
talking about | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the activity being done while relaxing with friends involves having a conversation or discussion, which is most closely associated with the option "talking about." The other options do not accurately describe the context of the sentence and do not fit the meaning of the sentence.
get up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person fell, which implies that they are on the ground or have fallen down. The natural thing to do after falling is to get up, so this option is the most logical choice. Receiving letters, crossing the street, giving gifts, and feeling embarrassed are not necessarily related to falling, and therefore would not be the correct answer in this context.
have fun | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating a hamburger with friends, which typically implies a social activity. Eating with friends is often associated with having a good time and enjoying each other's company, which is why "having fun" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "indigestion," "death," "tasty," and "gas," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct.
harmony | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that agreeing with someone you have fun with can lead to a positive outcome. The word "harmony" implies a sense of agreement and cooperation, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive outcome or connection with the context of the sentence.
eat meat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans have a natural inclination to hunt, which is typically done for food. Eating meat is a common practice for humans and is also supported by our teeth and digestive system. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
comparison shopping | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is visiting multiple stores with the intention of buying products. However, the reason for doing so is not immediately clear. Among the options provided, only comparison shopping would make sense in this context. Comparison shopping involves visiting multiple stores to compare prices, features, and quality of products in order to make an informed decision about what to buy. The other options (online shopping, running out of money, debt, overstocking) do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence.
fraternity house | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the party is being hosted by a fraternity, as the person is assuring their friends that they can also attend the party. Fraternities are known for hosting parties, particularly on college campuses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
most businesses | Knowledge: Fire extinguishers are typically found in buildings and spaces where a fire could occur, and most businesses are required by law to have them on hand. Boat and apartment may have fire extinguishers on board/in units, but it is unlikely for them to have one in their boardrooms specifically. Public buildings may have them, but not all of them do, and it is less common for them to have one in a boardroom. A chemistry lab would likely have a fire extinguisher as well, but again, it is less likely to be in their boardroom specifically.
retaliation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone has been accused of killing people that another person loves, which suggests that the person who loves the victims may seek revenge or retaliation against the accused. Retaliation is a common reaction to betrayal or harm, especially if the person feels a strong emotional connection to the victims. "Go home", "sadness", "remorse", and "going to jail" are not logical choices for a person's reaction to someone accused of killing their loved ones.
buy clothes | Knowledge: The problem presented in the question is that the person doesn't have pants that fit. The logical solution to this problem would be to buy new clothes that fit properly. The other choices are not relevant or helpful in solving the problem presented in the question.
drink water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that horses require a lot of energy to function properly due to their size and amount of exercise they get. As a result, they need to hydrate themselves properly by drinking water. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as running quickly or pulling a wagon are forms of exercise that horses are already getting, going away is not a solution or a requirement, and eating carrots does not address the issue of hydration.
nature preserve | Knowledge: The question implies that sloths are commonly hunted, so the answer that makes sense is a location where hunting is prohibited or at least discouraged. A nature preserve is a protected area where animals can live without human interference, so it is the most likely option. A forest canopy and a tropical rainforest are both habitats where sloths live, but they do not provide protection from hunting. A zoo is a controlled environment where animals are kept in captivity, so it does not fit the description of a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted. "Commercial" is not a location where sloths would naturally live.
landfill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to the improper disposal of trash, which is typically dealt with in a landfill. A landfill is a designated area where waste is buried underground under controlled conditions to prevent pollution and damage to the environment. The other options are either not related to waste disposal (hospital, parking lot) or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (ground).
backyard | Knowledge: The question asks about a pool near "your own home," which suggests a private residence rather than a public space like a YMCA or hotel. The option "neighbor's house" is possible, but the most likely answer is "backyard," as many homes have private pools in their backyard for personal use. "Waterfall" does not make sense as an answer, as it is not typically associated with pools in residential areas.
new york city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a group of people on the east coast where there are many skyscrapers. The term "skyscraper" is commonly associated with New York City, as it has the largest number of skyscrapers in the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stage show | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the students were involved in some kind of performance, as they were building a backdrop for it. Both "theater" and "stage show" are viable options, but "theater" is spelled differently in British English ("theatre"). "Photography studio" and "mini project" do not make sense in the context of building a backdrop for a performance.
can produce | Knowledge: Canning is a common method of preserving crops for long periods of time. It involves sealing food in an airtight container, like a can, and then heating the can to destroy any bacteria or microorganisms that might cause spoilage. This process is commonly used for fruits and vegetables, and is a convenient way for farmers to extend the shelf life of their crops. The other options do not involve preserving crops in any way.
mountains | Knowledge: Hiking is a popular outdoor activity that is usually associated with mountainous regions. Mountains are often home to a variety of wildlife, including foxes. The other options listed do not typically offer hiking opportunities or the possibility of encountering a fox.
real estate office | Knowledge: The context suggests that John is trying to make a sale, and he is talking to someone who can help him with that. The fact that he is willing to lower the price also suggests that he is involved in real estate sales, where price negotiations are common. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
living room | Knowledge: Folding chairs are often used as temporary seating options for guests, and the living room is a common place for entertaining guests. The other options do not have the same association with guest accommodation.
write down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the journalist had a straightforward approach to their work, and the phrase "see story" implies that they were able to quickly identify the key elements of a story. The phrase "write down" suggests that the journalist would take notes or record their observations in order to write their story later. The other options (sit down, would read, reading, remember) do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
living room | Knowledge: The sentence states that the stove had to be moved due to a kitchen remodel, which implies that the stove was temporarily relocated within the same living space. The most likely option from the given choices is the living room, as it is usually the largest open area in a home where a stove could be placed. The other options, such as apartment, friend's house, and restroom, do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not within the same living space. The option of boiling liquids like water is also unrelated since it does not provide a clear answer to where the stove was moved to.
take pills | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the patient resisted doing something that nurses prompted him to do due to his financial situation. One common way for nurses to prompt patients is to remind them to take their medication, which could be expensive if the patient was not able to afford it. The other options do not have a clear connection to being a poor patient or being prompted by nurses.
sporting event | Knowledge: Hot dogs are a popular food item at many sporting events, such as baseball, football, and basketball games. These events often have concession stands selling hot dogs and other snacks for attendees to enjoy while watching the game. While hot dogs may be sold in some of the other places listed, such as a park or a theme park like Disneyland, they are not typically associated with those locations as strongly as they are with sporting events.
richer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the husband received money (alimony) after the divorce. Since he never worked, it can be inferred that the money he received would make him "richer." The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
fancy restaurant | Knowledge: The word "fancy" suggests a high-end or upscale type of restaurant, which may have strict rules about the types of food and animals that are allowed on their premises. Live crabs are likely seen as messy or disruptive to the dining experience, so they may not be permitted in fancy restaurants. The other options do not provide any clear indication of why live crabs would not be allowed.
pharmacy | Knowledge: Prescription suntan lotion is typically only available through a pharmacy, as it requires a prescription from a doctor. The other options, such as a grocery store or tanning salon, do not typically carry prescription medications. The beach bag and shop options are also unlikely, as they do not refer to a specific type of store or retailer.
thrift store | Knowledge: The phrase "broken in" suggests that the person wants jeans that have already been worn and have a more comfortable, relaxed fit. Thrift stores are known for selling secondhand clothing, including items that may have already been broken in by their previous owners. Clothing stores may sell new, stiff jeans that have not yet been worn in, and the options of outside and closet don't make sense in the context of the question. Gap is a specific clothing store, but it does not necessarily specialize in selling pre-worn or broken-in clothing.
container  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus can potentially damage the floor, which indicates that it is a living plant. The correct answer would be a container, as this is a common way to pot plants in order to protect surfaces from damage. The other options do not have any connection with the context of the sentence: a dictionary is a book, the Middle East is a region, Earth is the planet we inhabit, and a tropical forest is a type of ecosystem.
watch tv | Knowledge: The question suggests that people have some spare time when washing clothes, which they use to engage in some other activity. Among the options given, watching TV seems like the most plausible option as it is a passive activity that can be done while doing something else. The other options do not seem relevant to washing clothes. Money is unlikely, getting wet is already happening while washing clothes, studying requires concentration and singing is an active activity that may not be feasible while washing clothes.
wait in line | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that waiting in line may be a solution to avoiding chaos when demand is high. This is because waiting in line creates a structured and orderly way for people to access what they need without pushing or fighting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feel relaxed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans benefit from taking a break, and specifically mentions feeling relaxed. This suggests that taking a break can help reduce stress and tension, and promote a sense of calm and well-being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be correct.
game store | Knowledge: A chess pawn is a game piece used in the board game chess. Therefore, it would make the most sense to look for it in a store that sells games, such as a game store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, except for toy store which might sell chess sets, but not necessarily individual pieces.
music | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy and June heard a pleasant sound while driving down the street. The use of the word "lovely" implies that the sound was enjoyable and pleasing to the ear. The other choices are not likely to produce a "lovely" sound while driving down the street. Air, for example, would not produce a sound that could be heard while driving. Movie, concert hall, and school may produce sound, but the context of the sentence suggests that the source of the sound is not in any of those locations.
envy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when John and Steve compete against each other, the losers feel a negative emotion. Envy is often felt when someone wants what another person has. In this case, the losers may envy the winner's success or skill. Resentment and injury both have negative connotations, but they do not fit the context of the sentence. Pride is a positive emotion and winning or losing is not a specific emotion, making these choices less likely to be correct.
good health | Knowledge: The question asks for the reason why someone would be getting in shape, and the answer that best fits this goal is good health. Regular exercise and physical activity are essential to maintaining good health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. While jogging, exercise, sweat, and feeling better may all be associated with getting in shape, none of them explicitly address the underlying motivation for doing so.
all of the above (feeling guilty, problems, getting caught, hurt feelings, being fired) | Knowledge: The question suggests that lying about oneself can have multiple negative consequences. Feeling guilty is a common emotional response to lying, as is the likelihood of facing problems or negative repercussions for one's actions. Lying can also lead to getting caught, which can cause hurt feelings for both the liar and the person being lied to. In some cases, lying about oneself can even result in being fired from a job if the lie is discovered. Therefore, all of the answer choices are possible outcomes of lying about oneself.
die | Knowledge: Suicide is an intentional act of taking one's own life. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be "die" as it accurately describes the intention of the person committing suicide. The other options do not match the context of the question and may even be considered insensitive or inappropriate. Cutting one's wrist is a form of self-harm, and swimming or interruption do not relate to suicide.
smile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is putting on a façade of happiness, which is commonly expressed through a smile. The word "pretending" implies that the person is not actually feeling happy, but making an effort to appear happy to others. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
livingroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity of working on needlepoint is done near the entrance of your home, which is likely to be a common area such as a livingroom. The other options are less likely to be near the entrance of your home or may not be suitable for working on needlepoint.
It is not possible to determine the correct answer with the given information. The sentence only suggests that James needed more sleep at night, but does not provide any context or details about what James did earlier. More information would be needed to determine the correct answer.
christian community | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is looking for a place with a church, which is typically found in a Christian community. Churches are places of worship for Christians and are usually found in areas where there is a large Christian population. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that potatoes are not raised in town, which indicates that they must be raised in another location. The most likely option is the countryside, as this is where many farms are located and where crops like potatoes are typically grown. Cellars and restaurants are not locations where potatoes are raised, and boiling is a cooking method, not a location.
religion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that science and another field are often viewed as conflicting or opposing, but many people find comfort in both. The other options, such as history studies, geography, math, and ghosts, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, the relationship between science and religion is often debated and discussed, so it makes sense that religion would be a possible answer.
apathy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being described is not feeling any enthusiasm or energy towards something. Apathy is the lack of emotion or interest in something, which fits the context of the sentence. Detachment and indifference are also related to a lack of emotional attachment, but apathy specifically refers to a lack of feeling. Hesitance and reluctance imply a different emotion of not wanting to do something, rather than simply not feeling any emotion towards it.
ancient history | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mammoth is currently extinct, and cloning it would bring it back to life. The term "ancient history" refers to something that happened a long time ago, and since mammoths are extinct, they are considered to be a part of ancient history. The other options do not fit the context as well because "recent" is the opposite of ancient and the other choices do not relate to prehistoric times.
harsh | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the troublemaker anticipated a lenient punishment but received a severe or harsh one instead. The words "soft" and "harsh" contrast with each other, making "harsh" the more likely answer. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
antidote | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has just consumed poison and another person is now taunting them. Given this context, it is logical to assume that the mockingly displayed item is likely to be connected to the poison, such as an antidote to counteract the effects of the poison. The other options, such as consumable, medicine, nutrient, and dosage, do not fit with the context or imply a negative intent on the part of the second person.
amusement park | Knowledge: Turnstiles are commonly used in locations where access needs to be controlled, such as ticketed events or transportation stations. The fact that this turnstile does not require a ticket suggests that it is likely used at a location where entry is already paid for, such as an amusement park. The other options may require a ticket to be inserted in a turnstile, or may not use turnstiles at all.
public outrage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that punishing innocent people with the death penalty is a morally reprehensible act that is likely to cause a negative public reaction. Public outrage is a common response to perceived injustices or violations of basic human rights, and it is likely to be particularly intense in cases where innocent people are put to death. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely consequences of this type of action.
articulate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity involving fingers and hands is related to movement or articulation. "Scratch," "cup water," and "soft" do not involve movement or articulation of the fingers in relation to the hand. "Sign language" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any other context or clues that suggest sign language would be the correct answer. Therefore, "articulate" is the best fit as it means to move the joints of the body, such as the fingers, in a precise and flexible way.
refrigerator | Knowledge: Lettuce is a perishable vegetable that can wilt and spoil easily if not stored properly. The best place to store lettuce is in a refrigerator, which helps to keep it cool and crisp. The other options are not suitable for storing lettuce, as they do not provide the same level of temperature control and protection from moisture that a refrigerator does. The supermarket and farmer's market are places where lettuce is purchased, not stored. The pantry is often too warm and dry for lettuce, and salad is a dish that contains lettuce, but not a storage location.
windowsill | Knowledge: The question suggests that a person owns a plant, which implies that the plant is likely located inside their home. Since plants require sunlight to grow, it is likely that the person has placed the plant on a windowsill to receive natural sunlight. The other options, such as street, Disneyland, or summer, do not provide any information about where the plant may be located or where sunlight may be falling on it. Grow lights may be used as an alternative to natural sunlight, but it is not mentioned in the question.
empowerment | Knowledge: The question asks for a positive effect of expressing yourself, which means we should look for an option that has a positive connotation. Empowerment is a positive term that suggests a sense of confidence and control. Expressing yourself can help you feel more in control of your thoughts and feelings, and can give you a sense of empowerment over your life. The other options have negative connotations and are unlikely to be positive effects of expressing yourself.
closet | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Danny is storing something he wants to access easily but doesn't want it in the way. A closet is a logical option because it can be easily accessed but is out of the way. The other choices don't fit because a cellar and a garage are usually not cozy or easily accessible, a car is not a typical storage location, and the post office does not fit the context of the sentence.
buy food | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Sally made purchases that were both fresh and frozen, which suggests that she went to a grocery store or a market to buy food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hotel | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is looking for both good bar service and a potential room to stay in afterwards, which is a service typically offered by hotels. The other options, such as train or wedding, do not provide these services. While some motels may offer bar service, they are generally associated with budget accommodations and may not have the same level of amenities as a hotel. Entertainment is also a vague option that may or may not include bar service or accommodations.
restaurant | Knowledge: Refills are commonly offered at restaurants when customers order beverages such as soda or iced tea. The other options - cup, sky, coffee shop, and stationary store - do not make sense in the context of the question and do not typically involve asking for refills.
respect | Knowledge: To contemn someone means to despise, scorn, or show disrespect for them. Therefore, if you contemn someone, they are unlikely to have your respect. The other options are all related to positive feelings or admiration, which would not be associated with contemning someone.
shake hands | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was thanking each person individually, which would typically involve some kind of physical gesture, such as a handshake. The other options, such as "appreciation" or "feel good", are more abstract and do not involve a physical action. "Happy" and "smile" are also less likely choices because they do not involve direct interaction between people, which is implied by the use of the word "each".
a challenge | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person struggles with hand-eye coordination, which would make playing baseball difficult for them. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that reflects the idea of difficulty or challenge. While playing baseball can certainly be fun, popular in Japan, and round (as a ball sport), none of these options accurately reflect the idea of struggle or challenge that is being conveyed in the sentence. Therefore, "a challenge" is the most appropriate answer.
take several forms | Knowledge: The question is asking about the behavior of water at different temperatures. Water can exist as a solid (ice), liquid, or gas (steam) depending on its temperature. It can also undergo changes such as boiling or freezing at specific temperature points. The other options are unrelated to the topic of water and temperature.
post office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you're moving, the people in the current location will help you forward your mail to your new address. The correct answer must be a location where mail is collected and processed, such as a post office. Envelopes are the items that letters are sent in, but they are not the location where mail is processed. A mailbox or mail box is where mail is delivered, but it is not where it is processed or forwarded. The front door is not a location where mail is processed or delivered, it is the entrance to a building or house.
plantation | Knowledge: Plantations were known for their extensive use of slave labor, especially in the Americas during the colonial period. Slaves were often seen as property that could be bought and sold, and their numbers on plantations could outnumber the actual citizens or owners of the land. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not have a clear connection to the use of slave labor.
make money | Knowledge: The question is asking what someone should consider regarding their job before buying a house, implying that the answer has to do with financial stability. "Making money" is the choice that is most directly related to financial stability and the ability to afford a home. The other choices are not as relevant to the financial aspect of buying a house. "Measuring distances" and "examining porch" could be something to consider when evaluating the physical aspects of a house, but they are not directly related to one's job or financial status. "Security" could refer to job security, but it is too vague and does not provide enough context to be a clear answer. "Make home" is not coherent grammatically and does not fit the context of the question.
nursery rhyme | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man used his bass fiddle to play something simple and fun for his baby. A nursery rhyme fits this description, as they are often simple and catchy tunes that are enjoyable for children. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - music and jazz band are too general, orchestra is too formal, and music store does not make sense in the context.
cupboard | Knowledge: Mugs are typically used for hot beverages like coffee and tea, and are usually stored in a cupboard or cabinet in the kitchen near the area where those beverages are brewed or prepared. The other options (bar, containing drink, and refrigerator) are not typical places to store mugs.
bright light | Knowledge: Shadows are formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light, causing an absence of light in that area, and creating a shadow. Therefore, to have a shadow, there needs to be a source of light. Bright light is most frequently associated with creating a shadow. None of the other options, such as ground, bridge, sunshine, or beam, are directly involved in forming a shadow.
disappointed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not get what they were after after standing in line for a long time. This could lead to feelings of disappointment, which is a common emotional response when expectations are not met. The other options- frustration, pain, fatigue, and order- do not fit as well with the context of the sentence as disappointment does.
wilderness | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in high altitude areas in mountainous regions, which are often referred to as wilderness areas. They are not typically found in jungles or low lying areas, so the choices of "south america" and "jungle" can be eliminated. "Outside" is too vague and doesn't provide any useful information, and "new zealand" is not known for having marmots.
excited | Knowledge: The word "called down" implies that the person was chosen or selected for something, which can often elicit excitement. The fact that they "ran down the aisle" further supports the idea of excitement and anticipation. The other options do not fit well with the context and do not convey the same sense of energy and enthusiasm.
losing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the poker player was not making any profit on the night, which means he was losing money instead. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. "Broke" suggests a state of financial distress rather than a specific activity in the context of poker. "Lost" and "loss" are similar to "losing" but are not the most common verb forms used to describe losing in poker. "Waste" does not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence either.
have job | Knowledge: The phrase "goes to work" implies that the person is employed and regularly goes to a workplace to perform their job duties. The other options may be related to the person's morning routine, but do not necessarily indicate whether or not they have a job.
the capital city of France | Knowledge: The context suggests that the individual is not impressed by the Eiffel Tower, which is a famous landmark in Paris, France. Therefore, it is likely that they reside in the city where the Eiffel Tower is located, which is Paris, or in the country where the city is located, which is France. The other options, movies, in Europe, and the capital city of France do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, if the sentence said "Where might someone who has never seen the Eiffel Tower before be from?" then the answer would be "movies" because someone who has only seen the Eiffel Tower in movies might not be impressed by it in person.
identification, money | Knowledge: A billfold is a type of wallet typically used to hold money, credit cards, and identification. The context suggests that the question is asking for the items commonly kept in a billfold. Therefore, the correct answers are likely to be the items that are commonly carried in a billfold. The other options, such as a cell phone or hip pocket, are not typically associated with a billfold. Additionally, the last choice, "man's back pocket," is not an item but a place where a billfold might be carried.
health department, library, bookstore | Knowledge: Informational pamphlets are commonly found in places where people go to access information, such as the health department or library. Bookstores may also have informational pamphlets available for topics related to health, self-help, or other informational subjects. Drawers and mailboxes are unlikely places to find informational pamphlets as they are not typically used for distributing informational materials.
you're bored | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kid was fidgeting with things, which is a common behavior when someone is bored. The speaker likely commented on this behavior by stating that the kid was bored. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
infinite | Knowledge: The word "vast" suggests that the universe is extremely large, and the word "even" implies that the following adjective should be even more extreme than "vast." "Infinite" means endless or limitless, which is a common way to describe the universe. The other options may also be used to describe the universe, but "infinite" is the most fitting based on the context of the sentence.
restaurant | Knowledge: The use of the word "paid" and "dining room" suggests a commercial establishment that offers food service. The other options, such as "own home" and "table to eat on" do not necessarily entail payment, while "mansion" does not fit the context of the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The presence of the word "work" in the sentence suggests that the man is likely in a professional setting, such as an office, where he is drinking his coffee. None of the other options are related to a work or professional setting.
money | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person organized an event to help a friend who was struggling with medical bills. This suggests that the goal of the event was to raise funds to help the friend. Therefore, the correct answer would be "money." The other options may be related to the situation but do not directly answer the question of what the event was meant to raise.
stand together | Knowledge: Similes are comparisons using "like" or "as," so we want to find a phrase that compares trees to something positive in the workplace. "Stand together" is a good option because it conveys a sense of unity, teamwork, and solidarity, which are all desirable traits in a workplace environment. The other options are negative or neutral, and do not provide a positive comparison to the workplace.
orbit | Knowledge: The question is asking about where astronauts who miss a landing might end up, suggesting that they did not reach their intended destination. The option "spaceship" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would already be in a spaceship to travel to their destination. The option "surface of moon" may be a possibility, but the context of the question suggests that the astronauts are still in space. The option "space shuttle" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would have to be in a shuttle to travel to their destination in the first place. The option "at the" is not a complete sentence and does not make sense in the context of the question. The option "orbit" makes the most sense, as astronauts who miss a landing could end up orbiting the moon, Earth, or another celestial body until they are rescued or can make it back to their intended destination.
school bus | Knowledge: The phrase "behind the seat" suggests that the fire extinguisher is located in a type of vehicle, rather than a stationary location like a house or garden. Among the options provided, a school bus is the most likely to have a fire extinguisher located behind the driver's seat or in another easily accessible location. The other options either do not have a clear connection to the context or are less likely to have a fire extinguisher located behind the seat.
freezer | Knowledge: The sentence is asking where chicken can be kept fresh for a longer period of time. Among the given options, the freezer is the logical choice since it is designed to preserve food by keeping it at a very low temperature. The other options, such as french fries, a plate, pizza, and a fast food restaurant, do not have any connection to preserving chicken or keeping it fresh for a longer period of time.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The options "opera," "park," "end of line," and "bus depot" do not have any clear connection to the context of people wanting to talk to someone. "Neighbor's house" is the most likely answer as it is a common location for people to gather and socialize.
brainless | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after getting high, the person's memory was affected and they felt like they couldn't remember anything. The word "brainless" implies a lack of thought or intelligence, which seems to fit the context of the sentence. The other options either do not fit the context or are not related to memory loss.
shelf | Knowledge: Books are typically stored on a shelf in a home, as this provides a dedicated space for them that is easily accessible. A cabinet or table could also potentially be used for storage, but it is less common. Obesity and backpack have no relevance to the context of the question.
get warm | Knowledge: The question is asking for the fastest way to combat being cold, and getting warm is the most direct and effective solution. Lighting a fire and chopping firewood may take time and effort, and making a patchwork quilt may provide some warmth but not immediately. Drinking up may provide a temporary sensation of warmth, but it is not a long-term solution and may not be effective if the person is already shivering or experiencing hypothermia.
better standard of living | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that changing society can have a variety of results. Out of the options given, only "better standard of living" is presented as a positive outcome. "Confusion and chaos," "depression," and "anger and depression will not change the society" are negative outcomes. "Sometimes bad" is too vague to be a clear choice. Therefore, "better standard of living" is the correct answer.
flowerpot | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a smaller ficus can be kept inside, which implies that it can be grown in a container. The word "flowerpot" specifically refers to a container for growing plants indoors and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
feel upset | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is seeing a messy house that was clean earlier that day, which implies that the person had a certain expectation of the state of the house. It is reasonable to assume that the person may feel upset or frustrated by the unexpected mess. The other options do not reflect a likely reaction to this scenario.
unpredictable | Knowledge: The sentence implies that starting a fire is a bad idea because of the way flames move. The word "unpredictable" suggests that flames can move in unexpected ways with varying intensity, making it hard to control them and increasing the risk of accidents or injuries. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for why starting a fire would be a bad idea.
large city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was stuck in traffic on the way to a movie audition. Since auditions for movies typically take place in cities with a lot of film production, the correct answer is likely to be a large city. The other options do not provide any context clues that suggest the person was in a city or on their way to an audition.
school | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about places where alcoholic refreshments are not allowed or restricted. Schools are typically designated as alcohol-free zones to provide a safe environment for students, which is why alcoholic refreshments are sometimes banned in these public places. The other options are not necessarily designated as alcohol-free zones, although some may have their own policies regarding the consumption of alcohol on their premises.
necessary to live | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why people eat food, even if they do not like it. The option "necessary to live" is the only one that provides a logical explanation for why people eat food. Humans need to eat in order to survive and obtain the nutrients that their bodies need to function properly. The other options are either irrelevant or do not provide a convincing explanation for the question.
fire | Knowledge: Combustible materials are those that are capable of catching fire and burning. Applying a heat source to these materials with ill intentions could easily result in a fire. Burns and damage are possible consequences of a fire, but they are not the direct result of applying a heat source to combustible materials. Going to jail is a consequence of committing a crime, but it is not necessarily related to the act of applying a heat source to combustible materials. Warmth is a consequence of applying heat, but it does not accurately describe the potential danger or damage that could occur.
middle america | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is likely a region that includes both plains and mountains. Middle America is a region that includes parts of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, and is known to have a diverse landscape that includes both plains and mountains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
valley | Knowledge: A river typically flows through a valley, which is a low area of land between hills or mountains. Wisconsin is a state and not a feature that rivers flow through. Wilderness refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered by human activity, but a river can flow through a wilderness area or any type of environment. A bridge is a structure that crosses over a river, but a river does not flow through a bridge. A waterfall is a natural feature that forms where a river or stream flows over a steep drop in elevation, but a river does not flow through a waterfall.
unravel | Knowledge: The word "twist" suggests that the cord was tangled or twisted, and the phrase "tried to do what to it" indicates that the person was attempting to fix or manipulate the cord in some way. "Unravel" means to separate or untangle something that is twisted or tangled, which makes it the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
fulfilling | Knowledge: The use of the word "happy" suggests a positive emotion, which can be connected to the feeling of fulfillment. The man is seeing his idea become a reality, which can bring a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. The other options such as pain, excitement, inspiration, and manual do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
optical device | Knowledge: To see an extreme closeup of a potato, one would need to use an optical device such as a microscope or magnifying glass. The other options, such as a grocery store or pantry, do not provide a means of viewing a potato up close. A garden patch may allow one to view a potato from a closer distance, but not at an extreme closeup level. Vegetable stew is simply a dish that may contain potatoes, but it does not allow for a direct viewing of the vegetable.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were building a backdrop for a play, which is commonly associated with a live theatrical performance. The mention of tools echoing in the empty space further supports this idea, as a theatre would have a large open space for building sets and props. The other options, such as bodyshop and photography studio, do not have any clear connection to building a stage backdrop.
own home | Knowledge: The question asks about someone's "favorite text," which implies that it is a personal item that they value highly. It would make sense for someone to keep their favorite text in their own home where they have easy access to it and can ensure its safekeeping. The other options (book store, newspaper, library, novel) do not necessarily suggest a personal connection to the text or ownership of it.
feel lonely | Knowledge: The sentence implies that being alone can lead to a specific emotion or feeling, and loneliness is the most appropriate option that describes this outcome. Feeling lonely is a common psychological response to being isolated or disconnected from others, and the other options do not relate to the emotional implications of being alone. Graduating from high school, entering college, or crossing the street are all unrelated to the context of the sentence.
indigestion | Knowledge: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Certain foods can trigger symptoms, and hamburgers are often high in fat and difficult to digest, which could cause indigestion for someone with Crohn's disease. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not relevant to the symptoms of Crohn's disease.
pain and suffering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hard-working man was injured and became stuck at home. Despite this, he tried to keep busy by doing housework, which had negative consequences. The answer "pain and suffering" is the best choice as it relates directly to the idea that the man's injury caused him to experience physical pain and emotional distress. The other options do not fully capture the severity of the situation described in the sentence.
demonstration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a product they want to showcase at a trade show. The word "finally" implies that they have been preparing for this event for some time. The word "show off" suggests that they want to demonstrate the product's capabilities or unique features. Therefore, the correct answer would likely involve showcasing or demonstrating the product, which is option D, "demonstration." The other options, such as store, shelf, market, and dance, do not fit the context of the sentence.
discomfort | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the people in question only have a "bit" of hunger, which suggests that they are not experiencing extreme hunger or starvation. Therefore, options like starvation and anger can be ruled out. The sentence also implies that the hunger is not severe enough to require immediate action, like having lunch or eating, which eliminates those options as well. Discomfort is the most appropriate choice, as it indicates a mild sensation of physical or emotional unease.
oxygen intake | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the football player is having difficulty breathing, which is related to the amount of oxygen he is taking in. The player puts on a mask, which can help him increase oxygen intake by filtering out pollutants and increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air he breathes. The other options do not relate to the specific context of the football game and the player's physical condition.
sharing information | Knowledge: The sentence implies that one of the reasons people talk is to communicate information with each other, which is best represented by the choice "sharing information." The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence - "obtaining information" and "exchange of ideas" could be considered similar to sharing information, but they do not capture the basic nature of why people talk. "Nose" and "dry mouth" are completely unrelated to the topic of conversation.
play with toys | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cats enjoy a specific type of activity, and the answer choice "play with toys" is the only option that fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, cats are known for being playful and curious animals, and playing with toys is a common way for them to engage in these behaviors.
reach over | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child did something wrong at the dinner table that resulted in them being given a warning. The only choice that is related to the context is "reach over," as it is a common table etiquette rule to not reach over someone's plate to get food. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pay to | Knowledge: The question refers to the interaction between customers and a waiter in a restaurant, suggesting that the customers are paying the waiter for their services. "Pay to" is the only option that fits this context, as it indicates that customers pay money to the waiter. The other options do not make sense in this context.
Throwing | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the pitcher is getting ready to act, which suggests that they will be performing a specific action related to their position in baseball. In baseball, the pitcher throws the ball to the batter, making "throwing" the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in this context - "lose" and "injury" are unrelated, "competition" is not a way of delivering the ball, and "rolled" is not typically how a pitcher would deliver a pitch.
disagree with each other | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are disagreements happening within the team, but these disagreements are constructive in nature. The phrase "argue constructively" implies that the disagreements are being handled in a productive manner. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as they are either irrelevant or do not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.
studios | Knowledge: The question suggests that the monitor wall is used for visualizing sounds, which is a common feature in recording and music studios. Studios often use monitor walls to display audio levels and track waveforms in real-time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
choir | Knowledge: The term "soprano" is often used to describe the highest range of female singing voice. In church, a soprano singer would typically be a member of the choir, which is a group of singers who perform together as part of the religious service. The other options do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence or to the role of a soprano in a church setting.
strength | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah has a condition, but she still thinks she can do the work. However, the condition has taken something away from her, which is indicated by the phrase "robbed her of." Strength refers to physical or mental power and energy, which could be affected by a medical condition, and could explain why Sarah might not consider herself disabled, as she is still capable of performing tasks. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
orchestra | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the viola is played alongside many other types of instruments, which is a characteristic commonly associated with orchestras. Orchestras are large groups of musicians who play a variety of instruments, including strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. A string quartet, on the other hand, only includes four string instruments (two violins, a viola, and a cello), while a symphony is a musical composition that is typically played by an orchestra. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
closet | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people own multiple pairs of jeans and store them somewhere in their home. A closet is a common storage space for clothing, including jeans. The other options - gap, mailbox, shopping mall, thrift store - are not typically used as storage spaces for personal belongings.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that spare pencils were provided for students to use in case they did not have their own. It also suggests that this was a common practice and that it was important for instruction to continue without interruption. Therefore, the likely location for the spare pencils would be in the classroom where they are easily accessible to the students. The other options may also have pencils, but they do not specifically relate to the context of the sentence.
laughter | Knowledge: Parties are typically associated with a fun and social atmosphere, where people gather to enjoy each others' company. The use of drugs or having babies at a party would not be appropriate or considered desirable by most people, while meeting new people is a possibility but not necessarily a given. Laughter, on the other hand, is a common sound heard at parties as people joke, dance, and chat with each other.
London | Knowledge: The phrase "across the pond" is a colloquial expression commonly used to refer to traveling from the United States to the United Kingdom (which are separated by the Atlantic Ocean). The sentence suggests that the artist's next art gallery was in a city located in the UK, and the only option out of the ones given that is in the UK is London. The other options are either locations in the United States or do not specify a location.
night sky | Knowledge: The term "star" is often used to refer to celestial objects that are visible in the night sky, which suggests that the answer relates to this context. The other choices, such as press conference or globular cluster, do not typically involve stars, whereas the Milky Way and heavens are broader terms that could refer to a variety of celestial objects or locations. Therefore, the correct answer must be the option that specifically relates to the visibility of stars.
office building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the large clock is located outdoors, which eliminates options such as desk or shelf. The choice of words "large clock" also implies that it is a public or commercial space, which narrows down the options to office building or house. However, it is more likely to find large clocks outside office buildings, such as clock towers or building facades, than in residential homes. Therefore, the correct answer is office building.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the restaurant is not doing well in the countryside, indicating that there may not be enough people or demand for its services. Moving to a town could potentially bring in more customers as towns tend to have a larger population and more amenities. The other options do not provide any clear solution to the problem stated in the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The question asks for a specific location where a sitting policeman can be found. The context suggests that the person is looking for a policeman who is not actively patrolling or performing duties, but is instead sitting down. The most likely place for a sitting policeman to be found is in an office, where they may be completing paperwork, taking a break, or meeting with colleagues. The other options do not provide a clear indication of where a seated policeman might be located.
assembly line | Knowledge: Assembly lines are commonly used in manufacturing to put together machines and other products. The other options (street, laundromat, laboratory) do not have any connection to the context of the question and are unlikely to be the answer. A big building could potentially be where assembly lines are located, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
candies | Knowledge: Pinatas are typically filled with small toys and candies that are meant to spill out when the pinata is broken. In some cultures, pinatas are also used for celebratory events such as birthdays and weddings, and the tradition of breaking open the pinata is seen as a symbol of abundance and good fortune. Contraceptives, well fed, and owning a house do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, while fairness is not a typical item found inside a pinata.
water | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the object is a body of water that can be crossed with a canoe. The options "mountain stream," "lake," "boat house," and "campground" do not necessarily require a canoe to cross, while "water" is a general term that encompasses all bodies of water.
underwater | Knowledge: Jellyfish are aquatic animals, meaning they live in water. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to water. The options "cartoon" and "Japanese restaurant" have no connection to the natural habitat of a jellyfish. While some species of jellyfish may be found in specific regions like the Pacific Ocean or Red Sea, they can also be found in other bodies of saltwater. However, the one location that applies to all jellyfish species is that they live underwater.
take oath | Knowledge: The question is asking about actions someone might take to show their commitment to a loved one. "Taking an oath" is often associated with making a formal promise or commitment, such as in a marriage or other significant partnership. The other options, while potentially part of a committed relationship, do not necessarily demonstrate the same level of formal and intentional commitment as taking an oath.
junkyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man collected old appliances and metal throughout the day, which are items commonly found in a junkyard or scrapyard. These businesses specialize in buying and recycling scrap metal, which is why the man would have taken his collection there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
soccer field | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to playing with a ball that has grass attached to it, which is likely to be a soccer ball. A soccer field is a place where people play soccer, and it typically has a grass surface. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
human | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that all people have a certain commonality. "Everybody is their own" implies that everyone is unique in their own way, but "all people are" indicates that there is something that ties us all together. "Human" is the best choice because it is the one option that applies to all people. The other options are either too specific or do not apply to every individual.
riot  | Knowledge: The word "instituting civil action left and right" suggests that the government was taking legal action against many people or groups. The phrase "the people fought back" indicates that they did not agree with these actions and resisted in some way. The word "riot" implies a violent reaction, which would be a likely response to widespread and aggressive government action against citizens. The other options (going to jail, restitution, court case) suggest more passive or legal responses to government action, which do not fit with the idea of "fighting back."
injured person | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the nurse is prioritizing the treatment of wounds based on their severity. The most logical way to prioritize wounds by severity is to rank them based on how much harm they cause to the injured person's body. The other options do not make sense in this context - battle and emergency room suggest a location instead of a person, while food and body are not related to the topic of wounds and medical treatment.
lowers standard of living | Knowledge: Inflation refers to the general increase in prices and decrease in purchasing power of a currency over time. This means that as inflation increases, the cost of goods also increases, making it more expensive for people to buy the same items. If James wants the government to fight inflation, it suggests that he believes a higher inflation rate would negatively impact his financial situation. One possible reason for this is that inflation can lower the standard of living, making it harder for people to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. The other options do not directly relate to the negative effects of inflation.
light | Knowledge: When deep in a cave, it is typically dark and difficult to see. Therefore, a source of light would be necessary to find one's way out. The other options (deepfelt, high, frivolous, mountain) do not provide any guidance or assistance in navigating through a cave.
rely on | Knowledge: The question is asking about what a friend will do for you, which implies a sense of support and dependability. "Rely on" suggests that a friend can be trusted to provide help or assistance when needed. "Coming home" and "writing a letter" are specific actions that a friend might take, but they do not necessarily capture the essence of what a friend will do for you. "Keep secret" implies that a friend can be trusted with confidential information and is related but not directly answering the question.
perennial | Knowledge: The word "perennial" refers to plants that live for more than two years, and often bloom for several years in a row. This suggests that the flowers being referred to in the question are those that bloom repeatedly, and do not die after just one season. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
chinatown | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the sound she heard was likely a part of the ambient sounds of the environment she was in. Chinatown is a neighborhood in New York City known for its distinctive cultural identity, including the use of traditional Chinese instruments such as gongs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the cultural identity of New York City.
feel better | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the character was feeling negative emotions and turned to prayer as a way to improve his mood. The phrase "seemed to begin to make him" suggests that the act of praying had a positive effect and made him feel better. The other options (religiosity, relief, and safe) do not necessarily indicate an improvement in mood, and "feeling better" is the most direct and fitting option.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The options "hockey rink," "arcade," and "ice hockey game" do not make sense because a puck is typically used for playing ice hockey, and it is not customary to take home equipment from a game or rink. "Locker room" may seem like a possible option, but it wouldn't make sense to simply take a puck from a locker room unless the context of the question suggests otherwise. A "sporting goods store" is a logical option because it is where sports equipment is sold, and it is likely that one could purchase a puck from there to take home.
deaths | Knowledge: The question suggests that love is not able to conquer something related to the life-cycle. It is known that death is a natural part of the life-cycle and is often seen as something that cannot be conquered or overcome. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
water | Knowledge: TV studios often use milk as a substitute for water when filming certain scenes, such as in cereal commercials or scenes where it is necessary to have liquid in a container. Milk can be used to create the appearance of water without the risk of spillage, and also adds a slight creamy or opaque quality to the liquid on screen. The other options are not commonly associated with the use of milk in TV studios.
manhattan | Knowledge: The name "Balthazar" has a French origin, which suggests that the restaurant may have a French theme or cuisine. Additionally, the answer options are all locations, and only "manhattan" is a city, which is a common location for restaurants. "Wine" and "underwater" do not make sense as locations for a restaurant, and "quebec" and "montreal" are Canadian cities, which do not fit with the French theme suggested by the name.
round | Knowledge: The word "round" is the most common and simplest way to describe the shape of a ball. It is a familiar vocabulary word for young children and is often used in everyday language when describing objects that are circular. While the other options are also related to the shape of a ball, they are less commonly used in everyday conversation and may be more associated with scientific or technical descriptions.
pizza box | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John opened something that he expected to contain food and was disgusted to find mold. The options "refrigerator," "breadbox," and "cellar" might all contain food, but they are not typically associated with holding pizza. "Carpet" is also unlikely because it would not typically contain food, especially not pizza with mold. The option "pizza box" is the most likely because it is specifically designed to hold pizza, and it is not uncommon for mold to grow on leftover pizza that has not been refrigerated properly.
greece | Knowledge: The word "amphitheatre" refers to a type of venue or structure that was commonly used for entertainment purposes in ancient times, particularly in ancient Greece and Rome. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the country that is historically associated with the use of amphitheatres, which is Greece. The other options - movie house, underground, park, and outside - do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
maze | Knowledge: A maze is a structure specifically designed to contain many passageways that form a complex puzzle for those who enter. A house, hotel, jungle, or labyrinth do not typically contain multiple passageways in the same way a maze would, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
great  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the critic's opinion and the public's opinion of the movie. The critic found it mediocre, which implies that it was not outstanding or exceptional. However, the public disagreed with the critic and called him jaded, which suggests that they found the movie to be great or remarkable in some way. The other options may also suggest positive qualities, but they do not necessarily imply a contrast with the critic's opinion or an explanation for why the public called him jaded.
surf net | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is looking for a way to entertain themselves when bored, and the options all relate to different activities that could be used for this purpose. Of the choices given, "surf net" is the most likely answer as it is a common activity people use to pass time when they are bored. Watching TV or hanging out with friends are also common options, but they may not always be available or desirable in every situation. Going somewhere or making a patchwork quilt are less likely choices as they require more effort and time than the other options.
pick up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the package was not delivered, likely because no one was available to receive it. This implies that the carrier attempted to make the delivery and was unsuccessful, and as a result, they would need to either try again at a later time or have the recipient pick up the package themselves. Of the given options, "pick up" is the most appropriate and makes logical sense in this context. The other options do not fit the situation described in the sentence.
oven | Knowledge: Baking typically involves cooking food in an oven using heat. Therefore, it is logical to assume that an unbaked cake should be placed in an oven to be baked. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - a refrigerator is too cold and a trash can obviously isn't a place to store food. A bakery or a birthday party also do not make sense as places to put an unbaked cake, as these are events or locations related to serving baked goods.
play chess | Knowledge: Boredom can result from a lack of stimulation or interest, and playing chess is often perceived as a slow and methodical game that requires a lot of concentration and patience. This can lead to boredom for some people who prefer more fast-paced or dynamic activities. The other options - being funny or learning/seeing new things - are less likely to cause boredom, while surfing the internet can be engaging or distracting for some people.
orchestra | Knowledge: The job of a conductor is to direct an orchestra, which is a large ensemble of instrumentalists playing together. The gong is a percussion instrument commonly used in orchestral music, so it stands to reason that the gong player would be playing with an orchestra. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence - Tibet, Chinatown, and music store are not likely to have gong players or orchestras, and "band" could apply to many different types of musical groups.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man played games as a way to unwind after work. The word "unwind" suggests a need to destress or relax, so it can be inferred that the effect of playing games was to help him relax. The other options may also be associated with playing games, but they do not specifically address the effect that playing games had on the man in this particular context.
steam room | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where water cannot be seen. In a steam room, water is heated to the point where it becomes steam or water vapor, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. The other options do not fit the criteria of water being present but not visible - crushed ice is visible as chunks, north and tidal waves refer to locations/directions rather than water visibility, and the surface of the earth may have bodies of visible water.
new york city | Knowledge: The sentence states that all delis in Bobby's location are kosher, which narrows down the options to a place where kosher food is prevalent. Germany and Jerusalem may have kosher food options, but there is no indication that all delis in those places are kosher. "Food court" is a location rather than a city or town. "Town" is too general and could apply to many places, but "New York City" is specifically known for having a large Jewish population and many kosher food options, making it the most likely choice.
falling down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person who gets drunk while on stairs is at risk of experiencing a physical mishap. "Falling down" is the most appropriate option as stairs are often associated with falling incidents, and alcohol can impair balance and coordination. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
problems | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone would commit murder, and "problems" is a broad and general answer that could encompass a variety of motivations such as financial difficulties, mental illness, personal grievances, or relationship issues. The other options are not necessarily related to committing a crime and do not provide reasonable explanations for murder. Going to jail would be a consequence of committing a criminal act, but it does not explain why someone would intentionally take someone's life. Guilty conscience and finding god are possible outcomes after committing murder, but they are not reasons for doing so. A knife is a tool that could be used to commit murder, but it does not provide insight into the perpetrator's motives.
new york | Knowledge: The fact that the sentence mentions pizza alone suggests that the fast food restaurant that the tourist went to was likely a pizza chain. Of the options given, New York is known for its many famous pizza chains, such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
possessing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that not having many belongings means that the person does not have a lot of material items. Possessing is the correct answer because it means "to have or own something", which is the opposite of not having many belongings. Sufficient and enough are related to quantity or amount, but do not necessarily indicate ownership or possession. Plethora means "an excessive amount" and lackbrain is not a proper word.
countryside | Knowledge: Bees are known to be attracted to wildflowers, which are typically found in natural settings such as fields, meadows, and other rural areas. The term "countryside" refers to these types of settings, making it the most likely answer. The other options, such as the United States or the beach, do not have the same association with wildflowers and bees.
die | Knowledge: When trees are dry, they lack moisture and are unable to obtain the nutrients they need to survive. Thus, it is likely that they will die. The other options are unlikely because they do not directly relate to the problem of the trees being dry. For example, trees that branch out or stand together could be healthy or not.
hamper | Knowledge: The verb "used" suggests that the clothing needs to be washed or cleaned, and the best place to put it in that context would be a hamper, which is commonly used for collecting dirty clothes. The other options do not make sense in this context - a person or a house are not places to put clothing, "check" is not a common use of the verb in this context, and a backpack is unlikely to be the place where clothing that needs washing would be stored.
busy city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a location where one can find thousands of bus stations, which indicates a highly populated and busy area. The other choices, such as maps and streets, are not specific locations that would have a large number of bus stations. Portland may have multiple bus stations, but it does not necessarily have thousands, and the city center alone would not account for such a high number of bus stations.
eat hamburger | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Randy is craving a specific type of food, a hamburger. It suggests that he is not concerned about additional toppings or ingredients, which could suggest that this is a simple, basic craving. The other options do not clearly connect with the context of the sentence.
rivalry | Knowledge: The term "rivalry" suggests a competitive relationship where both parties are trying to outdo each other. This can often lead to negative feelings between the competitors, as each is trying to come out on top. The other choices, such as winning or losing, accomplishment, achievements, and death, do not necessarily imply a negative relationship between the two individuals competing.
georgia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer wants to grow cotton in a location close to Florida. Georgia is a state that borders Florida and is known for its cotton production, making it the best option among the choices given. Orlando is a city in Florida and not a suitable location for cotton farming. Fabric and medicine cabinet are not related to the question, and North Carolina is further away from Florida than Georgia.
increase knowledge | Knowledge: The question is asking for what can lead to a better understanding. Increasing one's knowledge is a clear way to gain a better understanding of a topic. The other options, such as an interest in something or having ideas or wisdom, may contribute to better understanding as well, but increasing knowledge is the most direct and specific answer to the question. A coffee table is not relevant to the question.
candy store | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place where a child might be happy to find chocolate. The options "nearby" and "box" do not refer to a specific location where chocolate can be found. While chocolate can be found in a supermarket, it is not a place that a child would typically associate with happiness or excitement. On the other hand, a candy store is a place specifically dedicated to selling candy, including chocolate, which might be a place where a child would be happy to find chocolate. Similarly, a Christmas stocking is often filled with small treats and gifts, including chocolate, so this could also be a correct answer.
television | Knowledge: The options concert, theater, and opera are not devices, but rather venues where events are held. Microwave is a kitchen appliance and not designed to play video content. Television is a device that can be used to watch programs from the comfort of one's home, making it the correct answer.
matter to | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman's love for someone is not reciprocated, and she is looking at him with a sense of longing. The phrase "want to be" implies that she wants to have some significance or value in his eyes. "Matter to" fits this context as it means to be important to someone or to be significant to them. The other choices, such as "get money from" or "go to college," do not make sense in this context.
inhale | Knowledge: Sneezing is a reflex action that occurs in response to irritation in the nasal passages, and is triggered by the inhalation of air. This explains why the correct answer is "inhale". The other options, such as "fart", "close eyes", "spray" and "blow nose" are not related to sneezing and hence are incorrect.
front door | Knowledge: In a house, it is common to have a doorbell or bell located near the front entrance so visitors can announce their arrival. This is often used in place of knocking or yelling to get the attention of someone inside. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
feeling satisfied | Knowledge: The word "delicious" suggests that the person enjoyed their lunch, and feeling satisfied is a common reaction to enjoying a meal. Becoming tired or getting sleepy might happen after consuming a heavy or large meal, but it is not necessarily associated with a delicious lunch. Feeling full is a possibility, but it does not convey the enjoyment of the meal in the same way as feeling satisfied. Getting fear is not a common or logical response to having a delicious lunch, so that option can be eliminated.
chemistry lab | Knowledge: The question suggests that adding hydrogen to something can cause an explosion, which is a phenomenon commonly studied in chemistry labs. In labs, hydrogen is often used in experiments and reactions that can produce explosive results. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
jealousy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James has a negative perception of relationships and believes that loving another person will lead to jealousy. This may imply that James has had negative experiences with relationships in the past or has a fear of being hurt by another person's actions. The other options, such as satisfaction or happiness, are less likely because they do not align with James's negative perception of relationships.
death | Knowledge: The question is asking for the final phase of a living being's life, which is commonly understood to be death. The other options do not accurately describe the final phase of life, although decay may be a part of the process leading up to death. Respiration and growing older are ongoing processes that occur throughout a living being's life, while "sometimes bad" is a vague and unclear option without any clear connection to the context of the question.
reproduce asexually | Knowledge: Asexual reproduction is a process in which single cell organisms can create new generations without the need for a partner. This is done through methods such as binary fission, budding, or fragmentation. The other answer choices are not related to the process of reproduction and do not make sense in the context of the question.
meditate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that sitting quietly is a deliberate action that involves some form of mental focus or relaxation. Meditating is a commonly practiced technique for achieving a state of quiet mindfulness. The other options may involve being quiet, but do not necessarily require an intentional focus on relaxation or mindfulness.
eat smores | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the mascot gathered the children around the campfire, which is a common activity associated with toasting marshmallows and making s'mores. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence.
substance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is looking for molecules, which are the building blocks of substances. Therefore, it is most likely that John would look for molecules in a substance. The other options (elements, anything, air, hands) do not specifically relate to the concept of molecules or their location.
bible | Knowledge: The Bible contains many references to trees, including apple trees. The mention of an apple tree suggests that the question is related to a religious or moral context, as the apple tree is often used as a symbol for knowledge or temptation in the Bible. The other options, such as New York or Spain, do not have any clear association with apple trees or the context of the question.
accident | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that skiing is risky and can cause a serious consequence. The word "accident" is a common term used to describe a negative event that occurs unexpectedly, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately represent the severity of the situation described in the sentence. Although falling down, falling in, getting cold, and tripping and falling could all be negative consequences of skiing, they do not convey the seriousness suggested by the sentence.
loss of life | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James is concerned about safety when playing games, suggesting a fear of harm or danger. The phrase "loss of life" directly relates to this fear, as it represents the potential for an extreme and irreversible consequence of an unsafe game. The other options do not reflect the seriousness or danger implied in the sentence.
lap | Knowledge: The term "tabby" refers to a type of cat coat pattern that involves stripes or spots, and is a trait that can be found in many domesticated cats. The sentence suggests that this type of cat is often found in a specific location when resting, which is on someone's lap. This is a behavior that is commonly seen in cats that are comfortable and familiar with their owner or caretaker, and is not typically associated with the other options provided.
amazon basin | Knowledge: The use of the word "tropical" suggests that the river is flowing into a region known for its high biodiversity and dense vegetation, which is commonly associated with the Amazon basin. The other options do not fit the description of a tropical forest or a region known for high biodiversity. Channels may be associated with water flow, but do not suggest any particular location, while countryside and national parks may not have the necessary environmental conditions for a tropical forest. Temperate zones, by definition, are not tropical.
reproducing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is asking about how living things continue their species, which can be interpreted as how they procreate or produce offspring. The word "reproducing" directly relates to this idea. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the question, as "communing" refers to socializing, "palpitations" refers to heartbeats, "perspiration" refers to sweating, and "respiration" refers to breathing.
exhausted | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker hasn't had rest recently, which implies that they may be feeling fatigued or tired. The option "exhausted" best captures this sense of extreme tiredness. The other options, such as "rested" or "muscles tired," do not convey the same level of fatigue as "exhausted." "Worked all day" may be a contributing factor to the speaker's exhaustion, but it does not necessarily capture the full extent of their tiredness.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that work is difficult, which can make one appreciate moments of rest or leisure. "Relaxation" is the most fitting choice among the options provided, as it relates directly to the idea of finding relief from the daily grind of work. "Unemployment" and "do nothing" are not necessarily positive states, and "earn money" is not a direct contrast to the idea of work being challenging. "Sleeping" may provide some relief, but it does not capture the idea of enjoying leisure time.
house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Bob bought a property, which suggests that the secret passageway was likely part of a building or structure. The other options, such as airport, hotel, or shopping mall, do not typically have private residences with secret passageways. Therefore, the most likely answer is "house."
safe deposit box | Knowledge: The question is asking where to store jewelry if you do not plan to use it soon. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, including jewelry, when they are not being used or worn. A lady's boudoir or bedroom drawer may be common places to store jewelry at home, but they may not be as secure as a safe deposit box. A suitcase is not a secure or recommended storage option for valuable items. A department store is not an appropriate storage location as it is a retail establishment, not a storage facility.
very smart | Knowledge: The fact that the dog is able to escape regularly suggests that it is intelligent and perhaps resourceful. Dogs that are highly intelligent may be more prone to escaping because they have a greater awareness of their surroundings and are curious about exploring beyond their normal boundaries. The other options (loyal, tired, friendly, faithful) do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not necessarily linked to a dog that escapes regularly.
department store | Knowledge: A fitting room is a space within a store where customers can try on clothing before making a purchase. While some clothing retailers such as Gap and malls may also offer fitting rooms, the term "department store" specifically refers to a large retail store that sells a wide range of products including clothing, accessories, and home goods. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely department store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
headaches | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the worker is experiencing negative health effects due to poor ventilation, which is a common cause of headaches. Headaches can be a symptom of exposure to fumes and other hazardous substances in the workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
syllable | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is used to pronounce parts of a letter, indicating that it must be related to sound or speech. Out of the given choices, "syllable" is the only option that refers to a unit of sound in a word, which can be pronounced individually. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the question.
male or female | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer is related to how humans are born, and specifically mentions two ways. Male and female are the two primary biological sexes that humans are born as, which makes them the correct answer. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, with emotional, adaptable, and selfish being personality traits, and left or right handedness being a physical characteristic that is not related to how humans are born.
opaque | Knowledge: The word "opaque" means that something is not transparent and does not allow light to pass through, which would make it difficult to see through a clear medium. The other options do not accurately describe a situation where a clear medium would be hard to see through, suggesting the correct answer is "opaque."
fairgrounds | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are various attractions, such as tickets, rides, and games, but the real money is made in food sales, which implies that this is a location where people tend to spend a lot of money on food. This is a common characteristic of fairgrounds, which are known for their extensive food offerings and the high prices that vendors often charge for their products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city or town | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about finding homes that are not attached to each other, which is a characteristic commonly found in neighborhoods or areas in cities or towns that are zoned for single-family homes. Denver and Michigan are specific locations and do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. An apartment building would typically have attached units rather than stand-alone homes.
buy food | Knowledge: The other options do not relate to the process of obtaining food in the same way as "buy food." Making food and preparing food require ingredients, which would have to be obtained somehow. Although finding food in the wild is a possibility, the sentence suggests that the person is actively seeking a solution to their hunger rather than relying on chance. Checking a cat's mouth has nothing to do with procuring food for oneself.
fairness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is dissatisfied with the unequal distribution of cake slices. The word "demand" implies they are seeking some sort of resolution or change. "Fairness" is the most logical choice as it addresses the issue of unequal distribution. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reading material is intended to aid in sleep, which is a common reason people read before bed. The option "learn new things" suggests that the reading material is educational and not necessarily conducive to sleep. "Memorize" is also not typically associated with bedtime reading, and "waking up" and "having fun" are typically associated with activities that occur during the day.
rug | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that typically goes under furniture, which can be inferred to be a type of floor covering. A rug is a type of floor covering often used to protect floors from scratches and damage caused by furniture legs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
weirdo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy is popular but at the same time considered strange because of his interests. The word "weirdo" is a common colloquial term for someone who seems odd or eccentric. "Nerdy" and "geek" suggest an interest in academic or intellectual pursuits, while "disliked" and "unknown" do not fit the context of the sentence.
losing weight | Knowledge: The sentence implies that going for a run has some specific benefit which is not related to illness. One potential benefit of running that is often cited is weight loss, so this choice is likely the correct answer. Breathlessness and satisfaction could be side effects of running, but they do not directly explain why someone would choose to go for a run if they are not ill. Mouth wash and better health are not related to running in any obvious way.
make time | Knowledge: The phrase "make time" is commonly associated with setting aside or creating blocks of time in one's schedule to meet or spend time with someone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of wanting to see someone.
discover truth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police had been unable to solve the case for years, and the family hired a private investigator in the hope of uncovering the truth. The other options suggest actions that the police or investigator could take in order to solve the case, but none of them specifically address the hope of uncovering the truth. Additionally, "gathering facts" and "gathering evidence" are similar to each other and are not distinct enough options to be both correct.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The question mentions a toilet "flying outside the atmosphere," which refers to space travel. The only option related to space travel is the space shuttle, which is a spacecraft designed to carry astronauts and equipment into space. The other options have no connection to the context of the question.
shame | Knowledge: Perjury is the act of lying under oath, which is a serious crime. When someone is found guilty of perjury, it typically brings shame upon them as they have been proven to have intentionally lied in a court of law. The other options do not fit as well as shame in this context, as they are not as closely associated with the social and personal implications of being found guilty of perjury.
mall | Knowledge: A mall is known as a shopping center that typically has many different stores, including clothing stores. The context of the question suggests that the clothing sellers are in the same place, which fits the description of a mall. The other options do not have many clothing sellers in one place. A backpack is used for carrying items, a yard sale is where individuals sell used items from their homes, and a closet is a storage space for clothing. A department store may have clothing sections, but it may not have many clothing sellers in one place.
trade places | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two groups of people want to vacation somewhere else without paying for it, which implies that they are considering exchanging their respective vacation spots. This is commonly referred to as a "house swap" or "house exchange," where two parties agree to let each other stay in their homes for a specified period of time. None of the other options offer a viable solution for how the two groups can achieve their goal of vacationing somewhere else for free.
excrete | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans have a long digestive tract, which is an important organ system responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. However, it also implies that there comes a point where something needs to be eliminated from the body, which is the process of excretion. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unrelated to the digestive tract.
son | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that fraternal twins can result in offspring of different genders. This is because fraternal twins come from two separate eggs that are fertilized by different sperm, whereas identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos. Therefore, it is possible to have a daughter and a son when mothers give birth to fraternal twins. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
western north america | Knowledge: Bald eagles are primarily found in North America, and their habitat ranges from Alaska down to Mexico. Western North America is a more specific location where bald eagles can be found in significant numbers. The other choices do not provide a specific enough location for finding bald eagles, except for possibly "eagle's nest" or "aerie", which indicate potential locations where bald eagles build their nests, but not necessarily where they are commonly found.
beehive | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that requires a queen to remain inhabited, which limits the options to organisms or groups with a hierarchical structure. A beehive is an example of this, as the queen bee is responsible for laying eggs and reproducing, and without her, the colony would eventually die out. The other options do not have a hierarchical structure or do not depend on a specific individual to maintain inhabitability.
good repair | Knowledge: The question is asking about the purpose of collecting toll road payments. Toll road payments are typically used to fund the maintenance and repair of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Therefore, the correct answer is "good repair," as this choice best describes the purpose of toll road payments. The other options do not relate to the topic of toll road payments or road maintenance.
war | Knowledge: When an army is sent abroad to combat zones, it suggests that they are being sent to engage in military operations. The term "combat zones" specifically refers to areas of conflict, such as battlefields or war zones. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be what an army would be doing in a combat zone.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Johnny's mom had hidden cookies from him, which suggests that they are located somewhere in the house. The word "jar" implies a container in which cookies could be stored, making it the most likely option for Johnny to search for the cookies his mom hid. The other options have no clear association with cookies or the context of the sentence.
clear | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the jeweler was impressed by the quality of the diamonds, specifically focusing on one particular characteristic. The word "clear" is often used in the context of diamond quality to describe the absence of inclusions or blemishes, which can affect the transparency and overall appearance of a diamond. The other options may also describe desirable characteristics of diamonds, but they do not specifically relate to the aspect of quality that the jeweler was impressed with.
drowsiness or lethargy | Knowledge: After eating, the body redirects blood flow to the digestive system to aid in the digestion process. This can result in a decrease in blood flow to the brain, leading to feelings of drowsiness or lethargy. Feeling full may also cause discomfort or a decrease in physical activity, but it is unlikely to lead to falling down. Being late for work or feeling sleepy may be unrelated to the act of eating lunch.
bedroom | Knowledge: An armoire is a type of large wardrobe or cupboard typically found in a bedroom. It is used to store clothing such as shirts, pants, dresses, and suits. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as an armoire is not associated with these places.
attic | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are boxes in a location that cannot be accessed while standing upright, indicating that the boxes are likely stored in a space with a low ceiling or limited headroom. Basements and garages typically have higher ceilings and are more accessible, while bungalows and lofts may not have an attic space at all. Attics, on the other hand, are often known for having limited headroom and awkward angles, making it difficult to access certain areas while standing upright.
feeling satisfied | Knowledge: The question is asking about the emotional experience someone has after carrying out the task of housework. While it may be true that the result is a nice home and a clean house, the specific emotion being asked about is satisfaction. Boredom does not seem relevant to the task of housework, while tiredness may be a physical result but not necessarily an emotional one.
taxi cab | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the local business purchased an advertisement on a form of public transportation. Options like "la ville" and "store" do not indicate a form of transportation. "Magazine" is not a form of transportation at all. While ads can certainly be placed on the sides of buses, the sentence specifically mentions a "local business," which suggests that they may have only purchased an ad on a more localized mode of transportation. Therefore, "taxi cab" is the most likely option.
rivalry | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the two teams were in constant competition, which suggests that they developed a sense of rivalry towards each other. Rivalry is a common result of competition, as each team tries to outperform the other. Accomplishment is not likely to have developed between the teams in this context, as they were competing against each other rather than working together towards a common goal. Enemies and bad blood also suggest a hostile relationship between the two teams, which is not necessarily the case here. Friendship is also unlikely to have developed between two competing teams.
open mouth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is in the process of drinking a liquid and is at risk of spilling it over. The most logical action to take in this situation is to open your mouth so that the liquid can flow in without spilling. Closing your eyes or using a glass would not prevent spillage, and buying a bottle or eating first are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
happiness | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is using meditation and yoga to find something that would improve their mental and emotional state. Happiness is a commonly cited goal of meditation and yoga, as they are used to reduce stress and increase mindfulness. Ulcers, power, respect, and getting answers are not typically associated with the benefits of meditation and yoga.
significant | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the losing project had very little effort put into it, making the opposite true for the winning project. "Significant" and "considerable" are synonyms that suggest a large amount of effort was put into the winning project. "Important" and "useful" do not convey the same idea of effort, and "unignorable" is not commonly used in this context.
encouraging | Knowledge: The question asks about the behavior of fans towards players who are competing against each other. The word "competing" suggests a competitive environment, where fans may want to support their favorite players. The option "encouraging" aligns with this idea as fans often cheer for their favorite players and offer words of encouragement to lift their spirits. The other options (frustration, ignore, injury, emotions) do not fit the context and have a negative connotation.
physical fitness | Knowledge: Exercising is known to improve physical fitness, which includes an increase in cardiovascular endurance, strength, flexibility, and overall health. Being out of shape typically means that a person is not physically fit, and therefore exercising can lead to improved physical fitness. Exhaustion, breathlessness, and tiredness may occur initially, but these are temporary effects that typically dissipate with continued exercise, and are not the ultimate goal of exercising. Lost weight can be a result of exercise, but it is not a necessary or guaranteed outcome.
desktop | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common location for a calendar inside someone's home, which suggests it is likely to be a place where someone would see it frequently. This makes "desktop" a more likely option than "fridge" or "outside," which are typically not considered common locations for a calendar inside a home. "Wrist watch" and "office supply store" are also unlikely options as they do not relate to a specific location within the home.
discovering truth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the team is analyzing DNA evidence with the goal of discovering the truth about something. This implies that they are trying to solve a mystery or answer a question with the evidence they have gathered. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the process of analyzing DNA evidence or discovering the truth.
open mouth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that for some people, eating breakfast is an important part of their morning routine that they don't do until they have eaten. This implies that breakfast is important for these people and that they may not feel fully awake or alert until they have eaten. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate specifically to breakfast.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the car needed to be parked somewhere while the crew was working on the driveway. Among the choices given, the most reasonable option is to park it at a nearby location, and the neighbor's house would be a convenient option. The other options do not provide any logical place for the car to be parked.
fun  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that chatting with friends and playing games is enjoyable. "Fun" is a common word used to describe activities that are enjoyable and entertaining. "Laughter" is also a positive experience but does not encompass the entirety of chatting and playing games. "Floating" and "discomfort" do not make sense in this context, and "inspiration" is not explicitly mentioned.
magazine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a publication that provides information about new bullet varieties for weapons enthusiasts. Magazines are a common source of information for enthusiasts of all kinds, including those interested in firearms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with information sources for weapons enthusiasts.
think for himself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that as a student matures, they are encouraged to develop independent thinking skills. This is a common expectation for students as they progress through their education and become more capable of critical thinking and problem-solving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
wetting bed | Knowledge: Young children are not always able to control their bladder during sleep, which often leads to bedwetting. While snoring, sleepwalking, talking, and laughing are also behaviors commonly associated with sleep, they are not necessarily specific to young children. Therefore, the most likely answer based on the context of the question is "wetting bed."
dirty | Knowledge: The word "often" suggests that the answer may not be universally true, but is true in certain situations or contexts. The word "dirty" is sometimes used to describe sex that involves taboo or forbidden elements, or that may be considered socially unacceptable or immoral. The other options are more positive or neutral in connotation and do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
misunderstood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John cares for Lucy, but has difficulty expressing it in a way that Lucy can understand. This implies that Lucy may not fully understand John's intentions or feelings towards her, which could lead to her feeling misunderstood. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they imply negative feelings and actions towards Lucy from John, which is not suggested in the sentence.
many colors | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the presence of different types of flowers would result in a visual display of varying colors. Flowers are often known for their bright and diverse colors, which is why this choice is the most appropriate. The other options do not directly relate to the visual aspect of flowers or are not necessarily true (e.g. not all flowers necessarily smell good or cover fields).
acquire | Knowledge: The context suggests that the individual had found something valuable or useful and wanted to bring it along, but was unable to due to lack of space. The word "acquire" means to obtain or gain possession of something, which would fit with the situation described. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
walking |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of walking could lead to the need to stop while driving. This could be due to pedestrians crossing the street or walking on the roadway. The other choices, such as "check mirrors" or "passenger," do not necessarily imply the need to stop while driving.
kiss | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a difference in behavior between two people and three people. Out of the options given, kissing is an activity that is commonly done by couples or pairs, whereas going hiking and grouping objects can be done by any number of people. Believing in God is also not necessarily limited to a certain number of individuals, and making babies typically requires more than two people.
neighborhood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opening of the small beauty salon would have an impact on the local economy, which implies that it is located in a smaller, local area rather than in a larger city or strip mall. The phrase "locally owned" and "neighborhood" also imply a stronger connection to the immediate community. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
arrested | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you are caught hurting someone else, the authorities will take action against you. The most logical consequence of this behavior would be getting arrested. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fleas | Knowledge: The sentence implies that dogs experience itching, which is a common symptom of flea infestations. Fleas are small parasitic insects that can cause irritation and discomfort in dogs, and can be easily spread through contact with other infected animals or environments. The other options do not have any clear relationship to canine itching.
tiredness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that standing in line is a difficult experience and there is likely to be some form of physical discomfort associated with it. The choice "tiredness" is the most fitting, as standing in line can cause fatigue or weariness over time, making it more difficult to maintain one's position in line. The other choices (fidgeting, pain, and cars) either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not relate to the physical discomfort associated with standing in line.
trying to stay happy | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is an important aspect of living that people often neglect. Out of the given choices, only 'trying to stay happy' fits the context of the question. Falling in love and doing sports are undoubtedly important aspects of life, but they are not necessarily overlooked or forgotten. Similarly, dying is simply a natural part of the life cycle, while 'seeing' could refer to a variety of things and does not necessarily relate to the question.
take lessons | Knowledge: Learning to play the violin typically requires formal instruction, which is why "take lessons" is the correct answer. Tuning the violin, practicing regularly, and asking questions can all be helpful in the learning process, but without professional guidance, it is unlikely that someone can become proficient in playing the violin. Relaxing may be beneficial for reducing stress or anxiety before or after practice, but it is not directly related to learning to play the violin.
skill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing poker involves an element of luck, but being successful in the game requires something else. The word "consistent" implies that the person must be able to repeat their successes and avoid failures, which is likely to be the result of a skill rather than a random event. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
ugly | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally isn't beautiful and describes her appearance as just plain. However, it is also mentioned that she has image issues and thinks that she is something negative. Out of the given choices, ugly is the most extreme and negative option, which fits with Sally's self-perception issues. The other choices do not necessarily describe Sally's self-perception accurately and are not supported by the given sentence.
hangover | Knowledge: The question mentions that the purpose of drinking was to get drunk, which implies that the individual consumed a significant amount of alcohol. Hangovers are commonly experienced after consuming large amounts of alcohol and are characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, and dehydration. The other options, such as getting drunk or loss of control, describe the act of drinking rather than the aftermath, while need to urinate and sickness can occur with or without alcohol consumption.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the favorite show has a specific purpose or effect, which is to eliminate a particular feeling. The options "happiness" and "entertained" describe positive feelings that the show may create, but they are not the feeling being eliminated. "Entertains" is a verb and does not describe the feeling being eliminated. "Buy tickets" is not a feeling at all, but rather a possible action related to attending a show. Therefore, the correct answer is "boredom", as it is the only option that describes a feeling that the show aims to eliminate.
rainforest | Knowledge: The question implies that there is some danger facing trees and that one location is safest for them. The rainforest is a natural habitat for many species of trees and provides ample resources for them to thrive, making it a likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question and do not offer any convincing reason for why they might be safer than other areas.
build | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people went shopping specifically to buy racks, which are typically used for construction or storage purposes. The verb "build" is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to the purpose of buying racks. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical connection to the idea of buying racks.
chicken coop | Knowledge: The phrase "weasel out" suggests that the person is trying to avoid the consequences of their actions, which may be a reference to the animal known for its slick and elusive behavior. Since weasels often hide in small and cramped spaces, the chicken coop might be a fitting metaphorical location for someone trying to escape from punishment. The other options, such as court room or jail, are more straightforward and do not carry the same connotations as "weasel out."
get full | Knowledge: The sentence implies that having plenty to eat during lunch will result in a feeling of being satiated or full. "Getting in line" and "pouring coffee" are irrelevant to the context and don't make logical sense as answers, while "feel empty" is the opposite of what would happen if one had plenty to eat.
tasty | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people enjoy eating hamburgers, which suggests that taste is a primary factor. Clogged arteries, indigestion, and weight gain are all negative consequences associated with consuming too much fast food, which suggests they are not typically reasons why people like eating hamburgers. "Having fun" is also a possible reason, as hamburgers are a common food choice for social gatherings and backyard BBQs, but it is not mentioned in the sentence.
hinder | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of trying to help someone has had a negative effect, which is commonly referred to as "hindering" their progress or situation. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. Succeed and anticipate both suggest a positive outcome, while do nothing suggests no effect at all. Hurting may also suggest a negative outcome, but it does not match the context of trying to help someone.
opera | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific type of venue or event where older people are more likely to appreciate the singer's performance than the actual music being played. Opera is a type of musical performance that places a strong emphasis on the vocal performance of the lead singers, and many older people may appreciate the skill and technique required to perform in this style. The other options do not have a strong association with the context of the sentence.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of stopping being married to someone allowed the person to pursue their dreams, which implies that the marriage was somehow holding them back or causing them stress. Therefore, the most likely answer would be relief as it would bring a sense of comfort and release from the emotional burden of the marriage. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
tackle, fishing rod, bate (all three options are correct) | Knowledge: Fishing requires specific equipment such as a fishing rod, which is used to cast the line, and tackle, which includes hooks, weights, and other accessories to catch fish. Bate is also essential as it is used to attract fish to the hook. A boat or fishing pole may be optional and dependent on the type of fishing and location.
closet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Alexa is looking for a safe and secure place to store her acoustic guitar when she is not playing it. Among the choices provided, a closet would be the best option as it provides privacy and security, and the guitar can be safely stored away from any potential hazards that could damage it. The other options, such as a drawer, music shop, house, or studio, may not offer the same level of security or privacy for Alexa's guitar.
kiss | Knowledge: The question is asking for a physical action associated with love. Kissing is a well-known expression of love and affection, frequently used in romantic relationships, familial relationships, and even friendships. The other options, such as killing or painting, are not typically associated with expressions of love. Forgiving or pleasing parents may be actions taken out of love, but they are not physical expressions like kissing.
entertained | Knowledge: Watching television is often associated with entertainment, as people tune in to see their favorite shows or programs that are designed to provide amusement or diversion from daily life. While it is true that some people may watch television to be quiet or get comfortable, these reasons do not fully capture the main purpose of watching television, which is to be entertained. Additionally, the option "you're bored" may be a reason someone watches television, but it is not a goal or outcome that someone hopes to achieve.
Disneyland | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a costumed person, which is a common sight at Disneyland where employees often dress up as Disney characters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
were hungry | Knowledge: The question implies a specific situation in which girls would eat ice cream on the couch. The most logical reason for this would be if they were hungry and wanted a snack. The other options don't seem to be related to the context of the sentence or provide a reason for eating ice cream on the couch.
being comforted | Knowledge: The act of praying is often associated with seeking comfort and guidance from a higher power. Therefore, it is likely that someone who is praying while waiting for an outcome may feel comforted by the belief that they are not alone and that their prayer may be answered. The other options may be possible outcomes of praying in different contexts, but they do not necessarily apply to the specific question being asked.
overspending | Knowledge: Going on vacation can be enjoyable and relaxing, but it also comes with potential risks. One common risk is overspending, as vacations often involve expenses for transportation, accommodations, food, and activities. This can lead to financial stress or debt if not planned and managed carefully. The other options in the choices are not risks, but rather outcomes or feelings associated with going on vacation.
bed or closet | Knowledge: Shoes are commonly stored in closets or under beds as these are common storage spaces for footwear. Although shoes could technically be found under any of the options listed, such as a rug or table, these are not typical or expected storage locations for shoes. A water buffalo is not a logical choice for this question since it is not associated with shoe storage in any way.
prepare | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man wanted to have food ready for the work week, which suggests that he would need to prepare his meals in advance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: chewing and eating both refer to the act of consuming food, while digesting is a natural bodily process that occurs after eating.
chicken coop | Knowledge: Eggs are typically freshest when they are collected directly from the source, which would be a chicken coop in this case. Supermarkets and grocery stores may sell fresh eggs that are still relatively close to their collection date, but they may not be as fresh as eggs from a chicken coop. Eggs would not typically be found in a salad as a whole, and certainly not fresh ones. Similarly, eggs would not be found in a bird's nest as they would likely already be hatched and gone.
cabinet | Knowledge: Cabinets are a common storage solution for bowls in homes and kitchens. They provide a secure and protected space for the bowl, while keeping it easily accessible for future use. The other options are not viable storage locations for a bowl - apartments are not specific enough, outside leaves the bowl exposed to the elements, the dishwasher is not a storage solution, and a restaurant would not be a personal storage location.
forest | Knowledge: Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar, which is located off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is known for its unique and diverse array of animal species, including lemurs, which are arboreal primates that live in forested areas. The other options (hole, australia, cage, wilderness) do not have any connection to the geographical location of lemurs.
shock | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was experimenting with electricity, which can be dangerous if not handled properly. The word "feel" implies that the child experienced a physical sensation as a result of their experiment. "Shock" is the most common physical sensation associated with electricity and is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential dangers of experimenting with electricity.
forward | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person found the email funny, but did not reply to it. The word "although" also implies that the person did something else with the email. Of the choices provided, "forward" is the most likely option, as the person may have wanted to share the funny email with someone else. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve any action being taken with the email.
garage | Knowledge: In the context of the sentence, it's reasonable to assume that the folding chairs are larger items that require some space. Churches, attics, rooms, and closets are typically not large enough to store multiple folding chairs. On the other hand, garages are often used for storage of larger items like cars, bicycles, and outdoor equipment, making it the most likely option for storing folding chairs after a party.
direct traffic | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the policemen are wearing safety vests and holding flashlights, which are common tools used for directing traffic. This would be especially likely if the policemen were standing at an intersection or near a construction site, where traffic needs to be redirected for safety reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lounge | Knowledge: An armchair that is used by many people is likely to be found in a lounge or a common area where people gather and relax. Offices and studies are typically private spaces, and armchairs used in hospitals are likely to be specialized for medical purposes. Furniture stores may have armchairs on display, but they are not typically used by many people until they are purchased and taken home.
stress relief | Knowledge: The question is asking about a psychological benefit of having fun, which implies that the answer should be related to mental or emotional well-being. Out of the options provided, stress relief is the most directly linked to this theme. Studies show that having fun and engaging in enjoyable activities can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood. The other options (glee, smiling, twinkle, may laugh) are related to happiness or expression of emotions, but they do not specifically address the psychological benefits of having fun.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence describes a scene where wild flowers are in bloom, which suggests that the entire area is covered in flowers. The options "table," "vase," and "nursery" do not fit the context, while "countryside" could be a possible answer, but the phrase "entire countryside" does not quite fit the sentence. Therefore, it is most likely that the sentence is referring to the surface of the earth as a whole.
frame house | Knowledge: A loft is a type of living space that is often found in frame houses, which are typically constructed with wooden frames as opposed to concrete or other materials. It is less likely that guns would be stored in a kitchen or city apartment, as these locations may not have the necessary security measures or legal permission for storing firearms. A hunting lodge or ranch may also be viable options, but the context of the sentence does not provide any clear indication that the location is specifically a hunting or rural setting.
large building | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the school has three wings and enough space for 5000 students, which implies that it is a large building capable of accommodating a significant number of people. The other choices, such as buffalo, hospital, birdhouse, and mansion, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to describe a school in this manner.
opera house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the setting is one where a musical performance is being held, as there are people singing and a bass clarinet playing. Out of the choices provided, an opera house is the most likely setting for a performance involving singing and orchestral instruments like the bass clarinet. The other options, such as a school band or a music store, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
plants | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the farmer is growing a specific type of plant, which is a tomato. Therefore, it can be inferred that the farmer specializes in cultivating plants. The other choices, such as flowering or barn, do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence. The word "growth" could be a potential answer, but it is not specific enough as it does not mention what is growing.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was planning a vacation as a way to fulfill a need he had. The context implies that this need was related to his work and a desire to take a break or unwind. The option "relaxation" fits this context, whereas the other options do not directly relate to the need or reason mentioned in the sentence.
wear out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the product has a reputation for not lasting, implying that it may break down or stop working over time. "Wear out" is a common phrase used to describe objects that become worn down and less functional with use. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning conveyed by the sentence, as they suggest more dramatic and sudden forms of destruction.
scattering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the alley cats were all gathering together, but then something caused them to suddenly move or scatter in different directions. The word "scatter" is a synonym of "disperse" or "spread out," which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sudden and chaotic movement described in the sentence.
earn money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah was doing something productive or work-related while on vacation, and her mother was not pleased with her actions. "Unemployment," "say something," and "relaxation" all do not fit the context of the sentence, while "do nothing" could be a possibility, but does not match the mention of "hard work." "Earn money" is the best choice as it aligns with the idea that Sarah was doing something productive and work-related while on vacation.
sound | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is produced by the voice, and the word "sound" is a direct result of vibrations in the vocal cords. Volume and loudness both refer to the level of sound produced, while being heard is more of a passive action that results from the sound being produced. "Beautiful" is subjective and not necessarily related to the production of sound itself.
cool off | Knowledge: The act of getting wet is often associated with trying to achieve a cooling effect. When we get wet, whether through swimming or taking a shower, the water helps to lower our body temperature by conducting heat away from our skin. The option "get cold" may seem like a viable choice given the context, but it implies a passive state rather than an active pursuit. "Shrinking" is not a practical goal for most people when getting wet, and "shower" is a specific way of getting wet rather than a general purpose.
tree | Knowledge: The question suggests that something may fall or end up on the roof, which can be caused by external factors such as a nearby tree. Tree limbs or branches can be dislodged during storms or heavy winds and can fall on a roof causing damage or debris. The other options do not have a clear association with the idea of something falling onto the roof.
solution | Knowledge: Learning about world poverty can lead to a deeper understanding of the causes and effects of poverty, and can motivate individuals and organizations to search for possible solutions to alleviate it. While it may also cause feelings of sadness or confusion, the ultimate goal is to find ways to address the issue and create positive change. Enlightenment may also be a result of learning about world poverty, as it can broaden one's perspective and understanding of global issues. Loss of innocence, however, does not seem to be a likely outcome of learning about world poverty.
cow pasture | Knowledge: The word "herd" refers to a group of grazing animals, typically cows or other livestock. The options "slaughterhouse" and "dairy farm" suggest that the heifer will be used for meat or milk production, which is not mentioned in the question. "Cow palace" is not a typical term used to describe a place where cows graze or live. "Barnyard" could be a possibility, but it is a more general term that could refer to any area where livestock are kept, while "cow pasture" specifically refers to an open grazing area for cows.
movie theater | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that what the audience is watching is a form of entertainment. Out of the given choices, only a movie theater is typically associated with showing movies that contain scenes of battles, shooting, and explosions. The other options, such as a church or a hockey game, do not typically involve this type of content. While stadiums may host events that feature battles or explosions, the mention of "New York Stadium" in particular is unlikely to be relevant to the sentence.
refrigerator | Knowledge: Onions are best stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place to keep them fresh and prevent them from sprouting. The pantry and front porch are usually not cool enough to store them, and leaving them on the table may expose them to heat and moisture, causing them to go bad quickly. Pizza has no relevance to this question, making the correct answer "refrigerator."
instrument case | Knowledge: The question implies that the mandolin needs to be stored somewhere when not in use. Among the options provided, closet is unlikely to be the correct answer since it does not provide proper protection for the instrument. Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store are not suitable answers as they are places where instruments are sold, not stored. The most logical answer is instrument case, as it is designed specifically for the purpose of storing and protecting musical instruments.
meeting |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bosses are sharing knowledge in person at work, which implies a situation where they are physically present together. A meeting is a common scenario where colleagues come together to discuss work-related matters, which would be an appropriate context for sharing knowledge. The other options do not fit the context of sharing knowledge at work, as they suggest unrelated activities such as dining or studying in a formal academic setting.
stadium | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the audience is likely watching a sports game or activity where a ball is being used. This type of event usually takes place in a stadium, where there is a large open space for players to move around and spectators to watch from various angles. The other options do not typically have events that involve a ball being thrown or hit.
skip | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when children are happy, they engage in some kind of physical activity that indicates their joy, as opposed to passive activities like watching TV or sleeping. Skipping is a form of physical expression that is often associated with happiness and carefree behavior in children, hence it is the most appropriate option among the given choices. 'Enjoyed' is a past participle and cannot be used to describe actions in the present tense. 'Sleep' and 'watch television' are not indicative of children's happiness in this context, and 'awesome' is an adjective that does not describe an action.
rest area | Knowledge: Public phones are typically found in places where people may need to make calls but do not have access to a personal phone, such as rest areas along highways. The other options do not typically have public phones available, and it would be unusual to find a public phone in an office or someone's house.
go on | Knowledge: The word "perfunctory" suggests that the person completed something in a hasty, routine manner that lacks attention to detail. Therefore, the natural desire after completing something perfunctorily would be to move on quickly to the next task or activity, rather than to stay and examine or redo the work. The other options, such as "careful," "thoughtful," and "thorough," imply a level of attention and detail that is incongruent with the context of the sentence.
hundredweight | Knowledge: A "quarter" typically refers to 25% of something, and in this sentence, it is specified that the quarter in question has a weight of 25 pounds. This suggests that the item being weighed is likely measured in pounds or something similar, which rules out choices like "school year," "upper," and "century." "Hour" is also not a likely answer, as it is a unit of time rather than weight. "Hundredweight," on the other hand, is a unit of weight that equals 100 pounds, and therefore fits with the information provided in the sentence.
enjoyment  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not have to ride his bike, but he still did it for a reason. The reason is likely to be something that is enjoyable or pleasurable to him, since he was not doing it out of necessity such as thirst or fatigue. The options "for fun" and "pleasure" are synonymous with enjoyment and fit the context of the sentence.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the play was about to start, which is a clear indication that the setting is a theatrical performance. The choice "theatre" refers to a venue specifically designed for stage performances, which would be the most likely location for the play to take place. The other options, such as "show" or "in cinema," are too vague to accurately describe the setting implied by the sentence. "Bench" and "Martorell" are unlikely options as they don't directly relate to the context of the sentence.
stage | Knowledge: In the context of theater or acting, a cast typically refers to the group of actors who perform on stage. The word "perform" is also commonly associated with acting and theater, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is "stage." The other options, such as "cast net" and "broken leg," are unrelated to acting or theater. "Film" might also be a valid answer, but it is less specific than "stage" and could refer to acting in movies or television shows as well.
humiliation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dancing poorly in public can lead to a negative emotional experience. The word "humiliation" specifically denotes a feeling of shame or embarrassment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options don't necessarily convey a negative emotional experience related to dancing poorly, such as exhaustion or fatigue (which are physical sensations) and blisters or recognizance (which don't necessarily indicate a negative emotional experience).
alpenstock | Knowledge: The sentence describes an object with a point that is used for mountain climbing. This eliminates choices such as hat, arrowhead, and needle, which are not associated with mountain climbing equipment. Waterpoint is also unlikely, as it does not have a point and is not used for climbing. Alpenstock, on the other hand, is a type of pole or stick used specifically for mountain climbing and is known for its pointed tip.
beehive | Knowledge: Apiarists are beekeepers, and the term "queen" refers to the female bee responsible for laying eggs and leading the hive. To introduce a new queen to a hive, the apiarist typically cages her or binds her wings to prevent her from leaving. The logical answer to the question, therefore, is "beehive." The other options, such as "England," "monarchy," or "deck of cards," have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence.
universe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets that are similar to Earth. This is a statistical estimate that is difficult to confirm, but it suggests that the number of planets like Earth is very large. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. "God's creation" is a religious concept and not a scientific explanation for the existence of planets. "Ball stopped" and "gravity" are physical concepts that do not relate to the number of planets in the universe. The Milky Way is a galaxy, but the sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets like Earth in the entire universe, not just one galaxy.
make fire | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is attempting to start a fire, which is commonly done by using a match or other ignition source. The other options do not fit the context as there is no indication that John is frustrated, trying to illuminate anything, or trying to intentionally set something on fire.
playful mood | Knowledge: The behavior described in the sentence is typical of a monkey who is feeling playful and energetic. Monkeys are known for climbing, jumping, and swinging, especially within their habitat. The other options do not provide any clues as to the monkey's behavior or emotions. Brazil and the rain forest are locations that monkeys are found, but they do not necessarily tell us about the specific behavior of the monkey in the sentence. Treetops and busy are also not directly related to the monkey's behavior or emotions.
happiness | Knowledge: Going to play is typically seen as a fun and enjoyable activity for children, which would lead to a positive emotional response such as happiness. Tears and sitting would suggest negative or indifferent emotions, while being entertained and laughter are more general emotions that can apply to a variety of situations and do not necessarily indicate a specific reaction to going to play.
electronic devices | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that LEDs (light emitting diodes) are commonly found on keyboards and other items, indicating that they are typically used in electronic devices. The other options - television, pc board, electrical machine, and dashboard - are not typically associated with the use of LEDs.
get laid | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is expressing a desire for physical intimacy with a pretty girl before going to bed. The phrase "get warm" may be a euphemism for engaging in sexual activity, which would make "get laid" the correct answer. The other options do not fit with the implied meaning of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: Supermarkets are known for selling a wide variety of items, including food and beverages. Alcohol is often sold in supermarkets, along with other items for nourishment such as snacks, fruits, and vegetables. The other options do not typically sell both alcohol and items for nourishment. The lunch room may sell food, but typically not alcohol. The chemistry lab is not a place to buy food or alcohol, and restaurants and pubs may sell alcohol but may not have a wide selection of nourishing items for purchase.
apartment building | Knowledge: Flats are typically found in larger structures like apartment buildings, whereas options like London, City, and Town are too broad and do not appropriately capture the context of the question. Condominiums can also refer to individual units like flats, but they are not always grouped together in a larger building as frequently as flats are.
It depends on the context of the question as there is no clear correct answer.
knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person only enjoys reading fiction books, but there may be a benefit to reading a non-fiction book. The answer "knowledge" is the most logical choice, as non-fiction books are often written to teach readers about a particular subject or provide information about real events. By reading a non-fiction book, the person could expand their knowledge and learn something new. The other options (been printed new, many words, for fun, cover) do not provide a compelling reason to read a non-fiction book.
ranch | Knowledge: Cows are typically raised on farms or ranches for their milk, meat, or as draft animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be "ranch." The other options, such as "road" and "slaughterhouse," do not make sense in the context of where a cow would be present, while "Switzerland" and "Tennessee" do not provide any information about where cows are located.
offer price | Knowledge: A real estate agent's primary job is to help their customers find a suitable property within their budget. Offering a price is a common action that a real estate agent could take in order to negotiate a deal with the seller of a house. Misrepresenting, covering up, deceiving, or leaving town are all unethical or illegal actions that a real estate agent should not engage in. These options do not align with the responsibilities of a real estate agent.
softness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person did not like the previous mattress because it was too rigid or hard, so they are likely seeking a mattress that is softer and more comfortable. Out of the choices given, ductility, malleability, and flexibility all refer to a object's ability to bend or change shape, which is not directly related to comfort. Empity is not a word, and therefore cannot be the answer.
remake | Knowledge: The question refers to creating a new version of an existing movie, which is commonly known as a remake. The term reproduction refers to creating a copy of an original artwork or document, and may not fit the context of the question. Junior is not commonly used in this context. Copy and derivative could apply to many types of media, not only movies, and may not provide enough specificity to answer the question accurately.
overdraft or bankruptcy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that excessive shopping can have negative consequences. Overdraft and bankruptcy are both financial issues that can arise from spending more money than one has, which can be a result of excessive shopping. Calluses and tiredness are physical effects and are not directly related to shopping. Although spending money is a consequence of shopping, it is not necessarily negative on its own.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that an over-heated snake will seek shelter in a house, and the correct answer is likely a location in a house that is cooler than other areas. Basements are typically cooler than other parts of a house, which would make it a likely hiding place for an over-heated snake. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
music store | Knowledge: A saxophone is a musical instrument and would likely only be found in a place that sells musical instruments, such as a music store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
temperate climate | Knowledge: The question asks for the easiest place to live, which suggests a place that provides ideal conditions for survival. A temperate climate is typically characterized by moderate temperatures, with neither extreme heat nor extreme cold, which can be ideal for humans and many other animals to live in. The other options do not provide clear benefits for survival, and in some cases (such as gravesites), are not suitable for living at all.
formed into cubes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a hard substance can take on different forms, which implies that it is something that can be manipulated or molded in different ways. The option "formed into cubes" best fits this description, as it suggests a solid substance that can be shaped into different forms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Ice cream" is not a hard substance and "chipped" and "found in Arctic" do not necessarily imply different forms.
palace | Knowledge: Pleasure gardens were typically designed as an extension of the palace or royal residence, so it is likely that nymphs would be associated with this location. Nymphs are also commonly associated with nature and beauty, which aligns with the ornate and carefully curated aesthetic of a pleasure garden. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
india | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a subway station that goes by a different name than what is traditionally used for subway stations in other locations. India is the correct answer because their subway stations are called "metro" stations. London and New York use the term "subway" and "underground," respectively, to refer to their stations. "Big city" and "Manhattan" are too general and do not give any specific information about the name of a subway station.
pot | Knowledge: The question asks for a location to put a rosebush if the person does not want to keep it outside, implying that the rosebush needs to be kept indoors. Therefore, the correct answer would be a pot or container, which allows the individual to keep the rosebush indoors and move it around if needed. The other options suggest outdoor locations and are not appropriate for an indoor plant.
jamb | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the problem with the door occurs when it is closed, which points to an issue with the door's frame or jamb. A jamb is the vertical surface that forms the sides of a doorway or window frame. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being healthy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone jogging has a long-term goal in mind, which is likely related to their health. Jogging is a popular form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, increase overall fitness, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. The other options are potential negative outcomes of jogging and would not be goals someone would want to achieve.
car | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being referred to has an accelerator and is owned by most people. Airplanes are not commonly owned by most people, but rather by airlines or aviation companies. Fuel systems and accelerate are not objects that can be owned, but rather parts or actions associated with a vehicle. Therefore, the correct answer would be "car," which is a vehicle commonly owned by individuals and has an accelerator.
hospital | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person sustained a significant injury that requires medical attention. While a doctor's office or an emergency room could also be options for medical care, the mention of a "bad" injury implies that the person may need more extensive treatment than a doctor's office could provide. The other options, such as a hockey game or home, do not make sense in the context of someone needing medical attention for an injury.
porch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a new puppy that needs to go to the bathroom, and they have a newspaper to catch the leaks. The most logical place to put the newspaper would be outside, where the puppy can easily access it and where it won't make a mess inside. The porch is a suitable location for this purpose. The other options, such as floor, jail, next door, or library, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
leave work | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is going to work in the morning and returning to work in the evening, which implies that they are leaving work at the end of the day. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in the given situation.
men's room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the gentleman needs to use the restroom while out for dinner, which is commonly referred to as the "men's room". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
urban areas | Knowledge: Baseball stadiums are typically located in urban areas because they require a large amount of space and accessibility for fans. Urban areas provide the necessary infrastructure, transportation, and population density to support a major league baseball stadium. The other options, such as other countries or specific cities, do not make as much sense as they do not have a universal connection to where baseball stadiums are commonly located.
tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that not sleeping well leads to a certain feeling or state. Being tired is a common symptom of not getting enough sleep, which is why it is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately describe the feeling or state associated with sleep deprivation. "Time to sleep" is a suggestion, "closing eyes" is a physical action, "falling down" suggests a loss of balance or consciousness and "darkness" refers to the absence of light.
safe deposit box | Knowledge: The question asks for the best place to store important documents such as a car title or home deed. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, such as important documents, jewelry, and other items that are difficult or impossible to replace if lost or stolen. A glove box or library book would not provide adequate security, and a magazine article is not a suitable place for storing important documents.
together | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people who love each other are alone, they will want to be in each other's company and not be with other people or in a crowded setting. The word "contact" in this context means to connect or communicate with each other. Therefore, the most logical answer is "together." The other options do not make sense in the given sentence.
desk drawer | Knowledge: A paper clip is a small office supply commonly used to attach or hold together sheets of paper. It is often kept in a desk drawer because it is a frequently used item in an office setting. The other options (file cabinet, file folder, hospital, cabinet) do not typically house paper clips.
clean house | Knowledge: The word "maid" typically refers to someone who is hired to clean and maintain a house, so the end result of hiring a maid is likely to have a clean house. The other options are less likely outcomes, with "an affair" being completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
briefcase  | Knowledge: The context suggests that the businessman carried the book with him to work, as he kept it "beneath all his work." The most likely place for him to store a book that he carries with him to work would be in his briefcase. The other options, such as a shoe box, backpack, or synagogue, do not seem highly practical or appropriate for storing a book that is meaningful to a businessman.
win | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject has experienced a loss and is looking for something to help them feel better. "Win" is the most likely answer as it is the opposite of "loss" and could bring a sense of victory or accomplishment. "Contemplate" and "gain" may be too abstract or unrelated to the context. "Money" and "profit" may have a positive connotation, but they do not necessarily suggest a solution to the problem at hand.
found in church | Knowledge: The most likely place for the truck driver to find a Bible would be in a church. Bibles are considered to be a holy text by many religious groups, and churches often have a supply of them on hand for visitors and worshippers to use. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - confession is a religious rite, not a place to find a Bible, and hotels/motels are unlikely to have Bibles available for reading.
air | Knowledge: A projectile is an object that is launched into the air and travels through it until it hits a target. In this question, the options "battlefield," "gun," and "weapon" suggest a context of warfare where projectiles might be used, but none of them correctly answer the question as they do not describe what the projectile passes through. "Baseball" is also unrelated to the question. The correct answer is "air" because it is the medium through which a projectile travels.
working | Knowledge: The question is asking what beginning work is likely to lead to, which implies that the answer should be related to work or the workday. While options like sleeping and excitement may be things we experience before or after work, they do not directly answer the question of what beginning work is likely to lead to. The option "momentum" could be a possibility, but it is not clear how it relates to the specific context of beginning work. Therefore, the most logical answer is "working," as beginning work is likely to lead to a day of work. The option "stress" could also be a possibility, but it would depend on the context and personal experience of the individual.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person is waiting for food, which is commonly associated with being in a restaurant. The other options (church basement, wedding party) do not have any clear connection to waiting for food. The misspelling of "restaurant" as "restorand" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The option "feel relaxed" may be a desirable outcome of being in a restaurant, but it is not an action that a person would physically do in the reception area.
suit | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is in a professional setting, which typically requires a certain level of formality in dress. The most formal option listed is a suit, which is commonly worn by men in professional or business settings. The other options, such as tshirt or club attire, are not appropriate for a professional setting. Europe and church do not provide enough information to suggest a specific type of attire.
addiction | Knowledge: The phrase "thoroughly enjoys himself" suggests that the person may become addicted to using the computer. This is a common problem with technology and can have negative effects on a person's health and well-being. The other options do not necessarily follow from the sentence or are not related to computer use (e.g. sitting).
sever | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jennifer's behavior had negative consequences on her connections with others. The words "abrasive" and "clingy" imply that she was difficult to be around, which could lead people to pull away and, eventually, sever the connection entirely. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
anger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane caught someone flirting with her boyfriend, which can be a potentially upsetting situation. The most appropriate emotional response would be anger, as Jane may feel betrayed or disrespected by the other person's behavior. Jealousy is also a possible response, but it may not be the best answer as the sentence doesn't explicitly mention feeling envious or insecure. Unwanted pregnancy and happiness are unrelated and unlikely responses to the situation, while getting into trouble doesn't make sense as it is unclear who would be getting into trouble or why.
rocky places | Knowledge: Lizards are known to be cold-blooded animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. They will often bask in the sun on rocks or other warm surfaces to raise their body temperature. Therefore, rocky places would be the most suitable location for lizards to sun themselves. The other options are not natural habitats for lizards, and a tanning bed is not conducive to the needs of these animals.
delicious meal | Knowledge: Crab is a commonly consumed seafood, and people often make various dishes and meals using crab meat. The other options are not directly related to the context of the question and do not provide information about what people typically make with crab. The Chinese market may sell crab as a food item, but it is not a specific answer to the question. The fish market may sell a variety of seafood, including crab, but it does not indicate what people make with crab. The aquarium and tidal flats are not related to the use of crab for food.
nonstandard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student was attempting to find a synonym for "standard" that would impress the reader. The fact that the word he found had a slant rhyme with "proverbial" indicates that it might have been an unusual or poetic word. Of the options provided, "nonstandard" is the most likely to fit these criteria. "Informal," "basic," and "colloquial" are more common and less likely to impress a reader, while "stanine" is not a word commonly used in everyday language.
attic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John traveled to a place where the light faded away until it was pitch black, which is often associated with enclosed spaces that do not have windows or openings to let natural light in. Attics are typically located at the topmost part of a building and often have limited natural light sources. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
deceitful | Knowledge: The sentence contrasted Sean's honesty with June's lack of honesty, indicating that she is not simply untruthful or a liar, but rather deceitful. Deceitfulness implies a deliberate intention to deceive or mislead others, which goes beyond simply being untruthful or unreliable. The other options may be synonyms of deceitful in some contexts, but do not capture the same level of intentional deception.
trap | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the task is to catch a mouse. The most common and effective way to do this is by using a trap specifically designed for catching mice. The other options, such as disneyland, cupboard, and sewer, have no relevance to the task of catching a mouse, and a large bottle of valium is not a humane or ethical method of catching any animal.
jewelry box | Knowledge: The question implies that a choker is a type of jewelry that is not typically found in a jewelry store or boutique. Instead, the answer is likely to be found in a jewelry box, which is a storage container for jewelry. The other options (suffocation, boutique, and kennel) have no obvious connection to the context of the question.
health | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that washing hands after certain activities is beneficial and can keep you in good health. Regular hand-washing is a key practice in preventing the spread of diseases and infections. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
purse | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman had a spare key with her, and the most logical place to keep a spare key while out and about would be in her purse. The other options do not make as much sense as a place to keep a spare key, as they are either unrelated or not practical for carrying a spare key.
garage | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the door being referred to is used to store cars. Out of the choices provided, only a garage is commonly used to store cars, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as a house, file cabinet, or safe, are not typically used to store cars and do not make sense in the context of the question.
protein | Knowledge: The use of the word "bulky" suggests that the man is likely interested in building or maintaining muscle mass, which requires consuming adequate amounts of protein. Hamburger is a relatively high protein food, so this aligns with the sentence. "Crack" and "cook one" are not related to the context of the sentence and "good to eat" and "satisfy hunger" are too general and do not provide a clear answer.
factory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the steel cable has not been completed yet, which means it is in the process of being manufactured. A factory is the most likely place to find a steel cable that has not been completed yet because it is where steel cables are typically produced. The other options – winch, roller coaster, ship, and building – are not logical places to find an incomplete steel cable, as they are not typically associated with the production of steel cables.
cattle ranch | Knowledge: The context of cowboys herding heifers implies that they are likely on a ranch or farm rather than near a deep sea, slaughterhouse, or barnyard. The most likely choice is a cattle ranch where cowboy work and manage cattle.
chicken coop | Knowledge: Weasels are known to be skilled hunters and often prey on small animals such as chickens. Therefore, if a weasel is hungry, it is likely to go to a place where it can find easy access to prey, such as a chicken coop. The other options, such as a court room, natural history museum, or cherry tree, do not provide suitable habitats for a weasel to find food. Backyards could potentially have food sources such as bird feeders or garbage cans, but a chicken coop is a more likely target for a hungry weasel.
store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking to obtain butter to use for baking. While it is possible they may have stored some butter in their refrigerator, this is not a guarantee. Similarly, using butter from a neighbor or pastry shop may not be an option. However, a store is a likely place to find butter for purchase.
being happy | Knowledge: Celebrating is usually associated with positive events (e.g. birthdays, graduations, weddings), which would result in the person feeling happy or excited. Becoming tired or experiencing hangovers are typically not associated with celebrations, and drinking is a behavior that may or may not be present during a celebration.
far | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to has moved to a different state, which implies a significant physical distance from the speaker. "Far" is the most appropriate word to describe this type of distance. "There" refers to the location where the person has moved and does not inherently imply a specific distance. "Nearby" implies close proximity, which contradicts the idea of the person being far away. "In sight" and "being here" imply that the person is still nearby and visible, which again contradicts the idea of them being far away.
fridge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was looking for a snack, which is typically stored in a fridge. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not commonly used to store food items. A hardware store sells tools and equipment, a frying pan is used for cooking, a water fountain dispenses water, and a drawer is used to store non-refrigerated items.
winning or losing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that tying an event when competing is not an option, which means that the only possible outcomes are winning or losing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is standing in line for the box office to see a live performance, which is commonly associated with theatres. A theatre is a venue specifically designed to showcase live performances such as plays, musicals, and concerts. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, such as a venue or theater district which could refer to various types of events. A movie theater and ballpark are also not associated with live stage performances.
opera house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady is preparing for a formal evening event, and specifically mentions specialized looking glasses and gown, which are typically associated with formal events like those held at the opera. The fact that the butler is sent to a ticket office further supports this inference, as ticket offices for events like the opera are usually located at the venue itself, such as an opera house, rather than a train station or arena. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
camp ground | Knowledge: The term "outdoors man" suggests that the person is likely seeking outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or fishing. The option "camp ground" specifically refers to a place where people can set up tents or park RVs for overnight stays while engaging in outdoor activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with outdoor activities.
hearing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a song has the ability to emotionally affect the listener, and this effect is achieved through one of the five senses. The phrase "touch your heart" implies that the effect is emotional, rather than physical. The options "smelling" and "sniff" are related to the sense of smell, which is not commonly associated with music. "Seeing" and "sight" refer to the sense of sight, which is not directly related to the experience of listening to music. Therefore, "hearing" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the sense directly related to the experience of listening to music.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was sitting quietly and not doing something easily because the speaker was having trouble with something. The options discomfort, anxiety, and solitude may suggest that James was either feeling uncomfortable, worried, or alone. However, the option of falling asleep does not fit with the context of the sentence as it suggests that James was feeling tired and sleepy, which is not relevant to the situation described. The option of playing games also does not fit with the context as it is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is he was not falling asleep easily.
peck | Knowledge: The word "dominance" suggests that the birds may be engaging in aggressive behavior. "Peck" is the only choice that describes a behavior that could be considered aggressive. "Sky", "mate", "hatch", and "forest" do not relate to the concept of aggressive behavior or dominance.
mortuary | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being described is one that contains dead bodies, which is typical of a mortuary. The use of the word "morbid" reinforces this idea, as mortuaries deal with death and are often associated with negativity. The phrase "something very human" suggests that there is an emotional component to the place, which could be related to the grieving process or the solemnity of the situation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
school building | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about the location of the principal's office, which is typically found in a school building. The other options such as hallway, work, city, or skyscraper do not necessarily have a direct association with the location of a principal's office.
charming | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the real estate person had a negative impact on people, and that in order to improve, she needs to learn a new skill. The options of deceive, manipulate, and lie, all suggest unethical behavior, which would not be a desirable trait in someone in real estate. The option of train is too vague, and doesn't provide any information on what specific skill she would need to learn. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be charming, as this suggests that she needs to improve her interpersonal skills in order to better relate to clients and improve her sales tactics.
understood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that expressing oneself can lead to being understood, implying that the speaker may have previously not been understood. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
give birth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is asking about the first person in a group to have a child, which would mean the answer is related to the act of giving birth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. While some of the options, such as love, anxiety, and making new friends may be relevant to the experience of having a child, they are not specific to the first person in a group to do so.
judge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scorecards of the best contestant were lower due to jealousy, and that an investigation was conducted to determine whether the judge's scoring was fair. This implies that the judge may have been biased or unfair in their scoring, hence prompting an investigation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lazy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Emilio needed to exercise, but he did not do it. The term "lazy" is commonly associated with people who do not do physical activity even though they know it is beneficial. The other options, such as "suffered from bad breath" or "work out," are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide a likely explanation for why Emilio did not exercise.
static | Knowledge: The word "static" typically refers to interference or noise in the communication channel that can disrupt or distort the transmission of information. This interference can cause communication to break down or become difficult, which would explain why it could stop two people from communicating effectively. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
retribution | Knowledge: An honor killing is a type of murder carried out by a family member against another family member who is perceived to have brought shame or dishonor to the family. The purpose of an honor killing is often to restore the family's honor or reputation, which suggests that the answer is retribution. The other options either do not relate to the context of the sentence or are not consistent with the motives behind an honor killing.
over water | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a bridge that is famous for being red, which implies that the bridge is a well-known landmark. Additionally, the sentence specifies that the bridge is over water, which narrows down the possible locations. California and River Valley are too broad and do not provide any specific information regarding a famous red bridge over water. Dentist and Neverland are irrelevant to the sentence and are not related to the context of the question.
paper or classroom | Knowledge: A pen is a writing tool, so it is most commonly used on paper in order to write down notes, assignments, or other information. Students may also use a pen in a classroom setting during lectures or activities where writing is involved. The other options do not make as much sense since they are not typically associated with pen usage.
department store | Knowledge: A department store is a type of retail establishment that offers a wide range of products, including clothing and jewelry. It is common for department stores to have multiple sections or departments, each specializing in a specific type of product. In contrast, a suitcase, safe deposit box, ring box, and vault are all containers or storage units, and do not typically offer merchandise for sale.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is an area with farms and a small stream. The term "countryside" often refers to the rural areas outside of cities and towns, which would be a fitting description of this location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
celebrate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when an inventory sees their idea become reality, they will gather their friends together. The word "celebrate" is the most appropriate choice as it aligns with the idea of getting together to acknowledge and enjoy the accomplishment. The other options, such as "pride" and "gratification," suggest a more personal feeling of satisfaction rather than a communal celebration. "Gamble" is not applicable to the context, and "feeling of accomplishment" is too general and does not provide a specific action.
uncomfortable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of fiddling with one's shoes is not intentional, but rather a response to a physical discomfort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
enema | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to a medical procedure where water or other fluids are inserted into the rectum to stimulate bowel movements. This procedure is commonly known as an enema. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense as a correct answer.
profane | Knowledge: The word "profane" is often used to describe something that is not sacred or holy. In contrast, the other choices have no clear association with the concept of holiness. "Halibut" is a type of fish, "damaged" refers to something that is broken or not functioning properly, "common" means something that is widespread or ordinary, and "pope holy" is not a commonly used phrase in English.
ship goods | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's company is involved in selling products but doesn't have anything to do with manufacturing them. In this context, "ship goods" is the most logical choice because it implies that the company is responsible for transporting the products to their customers. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they have no clear connection to the sale of products. "Commit crime" is an obviously incorrect option, while "own resources" and "stock shelves" imply manufacturing or physical ownership of products, and "mail order" doesn't clarify how the products are delivered to customers.
learning | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the games were played with a purpose beyond mere entertainment or enjoyment. The use of "help" suggests that the games were designed to improve a specific aspect of the child's development. Of the options given, "learning" is the most likely because games can be a fun and effective way to teach children new skills or information. "Competitiveness," "losing," and "winning" are less likely because they are not qualities that typically require intentional practice or instruction. "Relaxation" is also unlikely as playing games with a 5 year old can often be active and exciting.
high walls | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the cubicles had walls that were tall enough to create a sense of privacy and enclosure, which is a characteristic commonly associated with high walls. The other options don't fit the context of the sentence – square shape, doors and windows, and borders don't seem to relate to the physical structure of the cubicles themselves, and an apartment feels like an unlikely comparison for the setting being described.
did not understand | Knowledge: The use of "re-illustrate" suggests that someone had already attempted to explain a point but it was insufficient. The context implies that the person being asked did not have an adequate understanding of the point to begin with, which is why it needs to be explained again. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
criminal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are rules against using sharp objects in a certain setting, and if someone reports using such an object, they would be considered a criminal for breaking the rules. The word "reports" implies that there may be consequences for using a sharp object in that specific setting, which supports the idea that the person would be considered a criminal. The other options - unobservant, above board, dull, and inaccurate, do not relate to breaking rules or the use of sharp objects in any way.
internet cafe | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the two friends were able to communicate despite their distance, which suggests the use of a communication tool that works remotely. The options "wedding," "fraternity house," and "movie" do not fit the context of two friends communicating from different countries. "Smoke signals" are not a practical or reliable communication method in modern times. Therefore, "internet cafe" is the most logical option as it is a place where one can use the internet to communicate with people remotely.
watch film | Knowledge: The question is asking for an indoor activity that can relieve boredom, which rules out options like skateboarding and skiing that are outdoor activities. Hanging out at a bar and laughing can be done both indoors and outdoors, so they are not specific to the question. Watching a film is a common indoor activity that people often turn to when they are bored, making it the correct answer.
exaggerate | Knowledge: The word "unscrupulous" suggests that the real estate agent is willing to behave unethically in order to make a sale. Exaggerating the positive features of the property is a common tactic that could make it seem more attractive to potential buyers. The other options -- lying, deceiving, charm, and hiring a band -- may be associated with real estate sales in other contexts, but they are less directly related to making a listing seem more attractive.
north dakota | Knowledge: The question specifically mentions seeing a fox in Fargo, which is a city located in North Dakota. None of the other answer choices are located in North Dakota, and one of them (England) is a separate country altogether.
table | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking for a location to place a lamp that will help them see better while doing homework. The options "house" and "building" are too broad and do not provide a specific location to place the lamp. "Desktop" may be an option, but it suggests the person is using a computer, which is not mentioned in the sentence. "Nearby" is vague and could refer to anywhere in the room. "Table" is the best option as it suggests a specific surface on which the lamp can be placed to illuminate the area where the person is working.
broom | Knowledge: A patio is typically an outdoor space that is made of hard, durable materials such as concrete or stone. It is likely that the surface of a patio would be best cleaned by sweeping away dirt and debris with a broom, rather than using a mop or toothbrush, which would be better suited for cleaning a softer or more delicate surface. Vacuuming may also be effective, but it may not be as efficient as sweeping, particularly if the surface is rough or uneven. Mobility is unrelated to cleaning the patio.
car crash | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a potential danger when driving a car, and one of the most common and serious risks is a car crash. This is an accident that can result in various injuries, such as whiplash, broken bones, or even fatalities. The other options do not relate to the physical danger of driving a car, but rather the purpose or environmental impact.
ocean | Knowledge: Fish from saltwater are adapted to living in an environment with high salt levels, which is characteristic of the ocean. Rivers and brackish water have lower salt content and would not be ideal habitats for saltwater fish. Boats and aquariums are man-made environments and the happiness of a fish in these settings depends on factors other than salt content.
human body | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the doctor noticed a nerve in a patient and recommended a scan of something related to the patient. The most likely option is the human body since it is the most relevant in a medical context. The brainstem is a part of the nervous system that is located in the brain, but the context suggests that the scan is more comprehensive. The skeleton is a part of the human body, but it is not a primary focus for a nerve-related scan. Organism and animal are very broad terms that do not provide any specific information related to the context of the sentence.
soft place | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is looking for a particular type of location. Cats are known for seeking out soft, comfortable places to rest, which is likely why "soft place" is a viable option in the choices. "The place I don't want it" and "barn" are unlikely options because they suggest locations that may not be conducive to a cat's comfort or safety. "Relaxed position" is a trait or behavior, not a location. "Urban settlement" is too general and does not provide any useful information about where a cat may seek out.
blow nose | Knowledge: When someone is sneezing a lot and has a runny nose, they are likely dealing with a cold or allergy symptoms. Blowing one's nose is a common action people take to clear out excess mucus and relieve congestion during these times. While inhaling and covering the face are also actions people may take when sneezing, they do not directly address the issue of a runny nose. Closing one's eyes is simply a reflexive response to the forceful expulsion of air during a sneeze. Spray could refer to a nasal spray, but this choice is less commonly associated with the act of sneezing and having a runny nose.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The phrase "not many people allowed to go" suggests a limited access area. Among the choices, only the space shuttle is limited in terms of the number of people who can actually go on board. The other choices, such as a street corner, supermarket or public place, do not have any clear restriction in terms of the number of people who are allowed to go. An airport may have security restrictions, but the number of people who can go is not strictly limited.
smiling | Knowledge: Smiling is a common facial sign of having fun, as it is a natural response to feeling happy or enjoying oneself. While laughter and pleasure can also indicate fun, they may not always manifest in a visible facial expression. Being happy is a more general emotion and does not necessarily indicate specifically having fun. Showing teeth could be a sign of aggression or a forced smile, and may not necessarily indicate having fun either.
need money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being described is living in America and desires a comfortable life, which would indicate that having sufficient financial resources is a necessity for her situation. The phrase "wanting to live well" implies a standard of living that most likely requires a certain level of income. The other options, such as saying hello or drinking tea, do not relate to the context of the sentence and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
garden patch | Knowledge: Potatoes grow in the ground, so it would make sense that they would enlarge in a garden patch or other similar outdoor growing environment. Ireland may be known for its potatoes, but it is not where a potato physically enlarges. Vegetable stew and grocery store are not places where a potato would enlarge. An optical device is not relevant to the growth of a potato.
urban area | Knowledge: The use of "palatial mansion" suggests that John's home is large and luxurious. It is unlikely that such a grand home would be located in a "sunny yard" or just "outside of house." "Front yard" is mentioned in the sentence but refers to the specific location John went to, not the overall location of the mansion. "Michigan" is a specific location, but the sentence does not provide any indication of where John's mansion might be located. Therefore, the most likely option is "urban area," which is a common location for large, luxurious homes.
floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Simon's book is missing and that his father is looking for it. Since his father has looked "everywhere," it is possible that the book may have fallen or been left on the floor. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
health centre | Knowledge: The term "spa" typically refers to a place where individuals can receive various health and wellness treatments, such as massages, facials, and body wraps. Health centres are often associated with these types of services, while the other options, such as houses or backyards, are not typically associated with providing spa-like experiences. The word "leaving" in the sentence also suggests that the location they are going to is not their current location, making options like house or backyard less likely.
silence | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John and Sarah were part of a contest and that they refused to talk. It suggests that they were required to remain silent as a part of the competition. The correct answer is "silence," which is another way of saying to remain quiet or not make any sounds. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they imply the opposite of remaining silent.
spectacles | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a specific part of the body, the bridge of the nose, which is commonly associated with wearing glasses or spectacles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
painful memories | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing artifacts repeatedly can cause a negative reaction, and specifically mentions the possibility of painful memories. This suggests that the artifacts may be connected to a traumatic event or difficult experience in the past. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
spiritual | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hippy girl helped him experience something beyond the physical realm. The words "tangible" and "corporeal" indicate that he had only experienced things that could be touched or felt, while the other choices suggest non-physical or abstract concepts. "Spiritual" is the best choice because it refers to matters related to the soul, faith, or higher power. The other options, such as "insubstantial" or "ethereal," do not necessarily connote a spiritual awakening.
party | Knowledge: The phrase "get some bubbly" suggests that the person is looking to celebrate or have a party. Additionally, the phrase "won big" often refers to winning a large amount of money, which would make it a prime time to celebrate. The other options, such as investing or getting money, do not fit with the context of the sentence.
live comfortably | Knowledge: The phrase "well off" typically refers to someone who is financially affluent and able to afford a comfortable lifestyle. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is "live comfortably." The other choices either do not fit with the context or have negative connotations that do not match the neutral tone of the sentence.
exit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was trying to escape from a place where a fire was happening, hence looking for a way out. The word "door" and the context of the sentence indicate that the person was likely searching for an exit door. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
exhaustion  |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running for a long time can have negative effects on the body. The word "risk" implies that something undesirable may happen. Out of the choices given, the most likely negative consequence of running for a long time is exhaustion, which means being extremely tired or drained of energy. The other options (marathon, fall, fall down, and sweat) do not necessarily have a direct relationship to the idea of exerting oneself physically for an extended period.
civilisation | Knowledge: An infestation is a term used for a large number of pests or insects that cause harm, while homes are individual dwellings and a graveyard is a place where dead people are buried. A spacecraft is a vehicle designed to travel in space. Civilization is a term used to describe a human society that has developed to a level of complexity with a large population, infrastructure, and culture. Therefore, civilization is the correct answer as it refers to a large group of human beings.
cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individuals were baking in a kitchen and needed to retrieve sugar from a storage area. Cupboards are common storage areas in kitchens where ingredients and cooking utensils are stored. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is an overuse of space, which is commonly associated with cities where population densities are high and space is at a premium. The reference to condos also suggests an urban setting, as condos are typically associated with city living. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as Central Park is a park in New York City, Milwaukee is a city in Wisconsin, vacation spots are typically not associated with condos, and suburbia is not known for having an overuse of space.
computer store | Knowledge: A disk with software on it is typically called a "software installation disk" or a "software CD." These types of disks are sold in computer stores where consumers can purchase new software or updates to existing programs. Computer hard drives are used to store data, but they do not typically come with pre-loaded software. CD players are used for playing music or other media, but they are not used for installing software. The electronic department may include computer stores, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
city | Knowledge: The use of landmarks for navigation is a common practice in urban areas with a lot of distinctive buildings, statues, and stores. The other options such as the countryside, national park, and map, do not suggest the presence of recognizable landmarks in the same way that a city would. A neighborhood might also have landmarks, but it would not likely be as useful for navigating if one is not familiar with the area.
orchestra | Knowledge: The term "large, professional ensemble" suggests that the context is related to music performance. The term "xylophone" also suggests that the musical instrument is being played. The term "orchestra" refers to a large group of musicians playing various instruments, including the xylophone. The other choices, such as museum, abc book, planet, and high school band, do not have any connection to the context of music performance or playing a xylophone.
All of the choices could be correct depending on the context, so without more information, this question cannot have one correct answer.
picture book | Knowledge: The question is asking where you can see a fake or not real sloth. A picture book is a common place to see illustrations of animals, including ones that are not real. A bad dream and the universe are not typical places to see illustrations of animals, and "another place" is too vague to be a correct answer. While a zoo might seem like a possible answer, the question specifies that the sloth is not real, meaning it's not an actual animal on display at a zoo.
golf course | Knowledge: The question is referring to a place where multiple lawns can be found, and the option that best fits that description is a golf course. Golf courses have many different sections of grass that are meticulously maintained to different heights and styles, so there may be numerous lawns on a single course. The other options do not necessarily imply a location where lawns would be plentiful, and therefore do not fit the question as well.
office |  | Knowledge: The word "office" is commonly associated with a place where people work, particularly in an administrative or professional setting. The other options - toilet, corporation, meeting, and company - may be places or entities that employees interact with during their workday, but they are not where employees typically spend the majority of their time working.
new insights | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is considering or exploring different opinions, which implies a desire to gain something. The options "revelations", "frustration", and "hesitation" do not necessarily imply a positive outcome, while "enlightenment" implies a more profound or spiritual experience than what is suggested in the sentence. "New insights" is the most fitting choice as considering different opinions is often done to gain a deeper understanding or new perspectives on a topic.
feeling good | Knowledge: The act of procreating typically refers to sexual intercourse with the intent to have children. Biologically and psychologically, this act can release hormones that create a sense of pleasure and satisfaction, which could be described as "feeling good." The other options are not directly related to the act of procreation or would not likely be the immediate result of it.
street | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where gutters and rubber hit the ground regularly, which is typically seen on a street. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A race track may have gutters, but rubber hitting it regularly is not a typical occurrence. Dirt on a bed or subway would be unlikely, and while dirt could be found on the ground, this option does not account for the presence of gutters and rubber.
social ostracism | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is well-known for frequent farting, which may be seen as socially unacceptable behavior. The consequence of this behavior may be social ostracism, where the person is excluded from social activities or events due to their behavior. The other options, such as evil or loud noise, do not directly relate to the context of the question. The options bad smell and stinking are relevant, but they are both consequences of the behavior rather than the actual consequence the question is asking about.
rainy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam found the outside to be beautiful despite a particular weather condition. The most likely weather condition that would contradict this would be "rainy," as rain can often be associated with gloom and sadness. The other options, such as "repulsive" or "horrible," do not make sense in the context of finding something beautiful.
monochromatic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is studying the use of color and its various shades, which is a characteristic commonly associated with the use of monochromatic colors. Monochromatic color schemes use variations of a single hue, often adding shades of white or black to create a range of tints. Therefore, the technique being referred to in the sentence is likely the use of monochromatic color. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sky | Knowledge: Airplanes are primarily used for transportation in the sky, so it is reasonable to assume that is where they usually go. The other options (war, aircraft carrier, crash, taxi) are not accurate or relevant to the context of the question.
auditorium | Knowledge: In an auditorium, someone may be sitting on a chair that is not visible to the audience, such as a stagehand, technician, or performer waiting to enter the stage. The other options do not typically involve someone sitting on a chair out of sight in this manner.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that plants are covering something, which is most commonly associated with the surface of the earth. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A greenhouse may have plants inside, but it is not covered in plants. A television and windowsill also do not have any connection to the context. A garden may have plants, but it is not mentioned specifically in the sentence.
sleeping in | Knowledge: The question is asking for an action someone can do after going to bed, which implies that they are already asleep. Therefore, the correct answer would not be an action that is typically taken before going to bed (such as making a sandwich) or a medical condition (such as pregnancy or insomnia). "Sleeping in" is a common phrase used to describe the act of continuing to sleep past one's usual wake-up time. "Drowsiness" is not an action, but a state of being that someone may feel before falling asleep.
barnyard | Knowledge: Cows are usually kept in barnyards, which are open spaces that provide shelter and protection from predators. In a barnyard, cows can move around freely, graze on grass, and be close to other cows which is essential for their social behavior. The other options, like slaughterhouses, stables, and grocery stores, are not appropriate places for a cow to be happy at night.
battlefield | Knowledge: A soldier is most likely to engage in combat on a battlefield, which is a location where military forces engage in conflict. Armored cars and tents may be used for transportation and shelter, respectively, but they are not specifically associated with fighting. A platoon is a group of soldiers rather than a location, and trenches are often used for defensive purposes rather than for actively engaging in combat.
increased heart rate | Knowledge: Jumping rope is a cardiovascular exercise that increases the heart rate, which is beneficial for overall heart health. Getting weight is not a health benefit and can be a negative consequence if it leads to overweight or obesity. Having fun and sweating are not necessarily health benefits, although they may make exercise more enjoyable. Hopping is a synonym for jumping and does not provide any information about the health benefits of jumping rope.
painting | Knowledge: The question is asking how an artist would create a fox, which suggests that the answer should relate to the process of making art. Painting is a common medium for creating animal portraits, including foxes, so it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as England or wooded areas, do not relate to the creation of art or the portrayal of foxes. "Ask them first" and "chicken coop" are irrelevant and do not make sense as answers.
laundromat | Knowledge: Lint is a common byproduct of clothing and can often be found in places where clothing is stored or worn. A rug, purse, dryer, and pocket are all areas where lint is commonly found. However, a laundromat is a place where clothing is washed and dried, and therefore it is unlikely that there would be a significant amount of lint buildup in this location.
loaf of bread | Knowledge: The word "heel" typically refers to the back end of something that is curved or angled, like the heel of your foot or the heel of a shoe. In the context of food, a "loaf of bread" is the option that makes the most sense as it has a curved back end that is sometimes referred to as the "heel" of the loaf. The other options, such as "foot" or "sandal," do not have any clear connections to food, and "shoe" and "boot" do not have any curved or angled ends that could be called a "heel."
outside | Knowledge: The question asks about the location of a person when they see an apple tree. The most likely location for someone to see an apple tree is outside since apple trees are typically found in outdoor environments such as orchards, parks, or gardens. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
car dealership | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the showroom had a variety of automobiles, which suggests that it is a car dealership. The other options such as bathroom, appliance store, or even city are not related to the context of the sentence. The mention of Vegas is also not relevant as the location of the showroom is not being questioned, just the type of establishment it is.
cafe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location where Bill saw the wild animal was unexpected. Out of the given options, a cafe would be the most unexpected place to encounter a wild animal. The other options, such as a zoo or park, are more likely places where one might see wild animals. The option "outside" is too general and does not provide enough context to make a guess. Woodland could be an unexpected place to see a wild animal, but the sentence suggests that it was a specific location where Bill did not expect to see a wild animal.
shelf | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the plates needed to be stored in their proper place, which implies that there is a designated location for them. The options "ironing board," "restaurant," "table," and "stomach" do not make sense in this context. A shelf is a common location for storing plates, as it keeps them organized and easily accessible.
doctor's office | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about a situation where one nurse works alongside one doctor. Out of the choices given, a doctor's office is the most likely setting where this would occur. In hospitals, there are typically more nurses assigned to a doctor, and the other options (resuscitate, reception, nursing home) do not necessarily involve a doctor-nurse partnership in the same way a doctor's office does.
quintuplets or multiples | Knowledge: The phrase "procreating goes awry" suggests a situation where more than one baby is born at the same time, also known as multiple births. Quintuplets refer to the birth of five babies at once, while multiples can refer to twins, triplets, or any other combination of multiple births. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence states that the mail scattered in the wind, which implies that it was blown away from the mailbox. The most likely place it would land in this scenario is the nearest object that could stop or redirect its path, which in this case could be the neighbor's house. The other options, such as a mailcatcher or post office, do not make sense in this context as they are not related to the scenario of scattered mail due to wind.
nap | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the cat was wild, but like all other cats, he had a common behavior. The answer choice that fits this context is "nap," as it is a common behavior of cats. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
security office  | Knowledge: The mention of "monitor wall" suggests that the location being referred to is likely a place where video surveillance is used. The options of hospital, department store, and guard station do not have as strong of a connection to video surveillance as security office or studio would. Additionally, the mention of "watching moving lines" reinforces the idea of surveillance, rather than a display for entertainment purposes.
turn brown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the grass did not receive any sunlight because of the car parked over it, which is likely to result in the grass being deprived of essential nutrients, leading to its death. This is a common phenomenon observed in lawns and gardens when sunlight is restricted. Turning brown is a common sign of grass dying due to lack of sunlight. The other options do not seem to be logical consequences of a lack of sunlight, except for 'dry,' which could also potentially happen.
learn | Knowledge: Reading is often associated with the process of learning, especially among children who are still in the early stages of language acquisition and cognitive development. Studies have shown that reading can enhance a child's vocabulary, comprehension, and critical thinking skills, which can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall intellectual growth. The other options do not reflect the typical outcomes of reading.
garbage dump | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the city needed a way to handle garbage waste, which implies a larger-scale solution than individual garbage cans or sewers. The options "street" and "gutter" are not appropriate solutions for managing garbage waste, and while garbage cans are a more localized solution, they would not be sufficient for managing the waste of an entire city. A garbage dump, on the other hand, is a common solution for managing large amounts of garbage waste, which makes it the most likely answer.
mulberry bush | Knowledge: This question refers to a well-known nursery rhyme that goes "Pop Goes the Weasel". The rhyme describes how the monkey chases the weasel around a mulberry bush. The other answer options are not mentioned in the rhyme and do not have any connection to the context of the question.
blooms | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a flower that is being stimulated by a fertilizer. This suggests that the flower will likely continue to grow and develop, eventually producing blooms, which are the colorful and fragrant parts of the plant that are meant to attract pollinators. This is a natural progression in the growth cycle of a flower, especially when aided by external factors such as fertilizers. The other options are either not related to the growth of a flower or do not accurately reflect the likely outcome in this scenario.
water fountain | Knowledge: Throwing pennies into a water fountain is a common cultural practice often associated with making a wish for good luck. The other choices do not have a clear association with throwing pennies. "Pocket" and "jar" imply keeping pennies rather than throwing them, "worthless" suggests a negative connotation with pennies, and "copper" is simply a descriptor of the material that pennies are made from.
tended | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy was unable to take care of himself due to his mental state, so someone or something had to look after him. The word "tended" means to take care of or attend to someone's needs, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options, "play tricks on," "form images," "michigan," and "mindblown," do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
trouser leg | Knowledge: The verb "tangled" implies that the ferret is caught or trapped in something. A petting zoo or cage would likely be designed to prevent animals from getting stuck or tangled. Similarly, an owner's home would ideally be a safe space for the ferret. The mother's hair is not a likely location for a ferret to become tangled. A trouser leg, however, could easily become twisted around a ferret as the animal explores or plays.
phone booth | Knowledge: Phone booths used to be a common location for telephone directories, as they were frequently used for making phone calls and people needed to look up numbers. In contrast, an office or house may have a phone directory but it would typically only be for the use of the occupants. A kitchen or amusement park would seldom have a phone directory available for public use.
gather flowers | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child is in a natural environment, specifically a meadow in spring. In this setting, it is likely that there will be flowers around, making it a natural choice for the child to gather. The other options, such as cleaning a room or setting a table, are not appropriate activities to be doing in a meadow. Additionally, the phrase "play with toys" is too general and does not provide any context-specific clues. "Forming opinions" is also not relevant to the context of the sentence.
stroked | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is not hungry, but is bored. Based on common knowledge and experience with cats, they often seek attention and affection when bored. Therefore, stroking the cat would likely be the most appropriate action to alleviate its boredom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and may even be harmful to the cat's health.
feel fresh | Knowledge: The sentence implies that having a meal or sipping hot drinks while reading is a pleasant and relaxing activity. Therefore, it is likely that the person will feel refreshed or invigorated, rather than catching a cold, drinking coffee, gaining new knowledge, or eating dinner (which may or may not be the case, but are not directly related to the activity of reading and having a meal or drink).
garden center | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the process of growing an apple tree requires acquiring a physical item or location, which is commonly found in garden centers. Garden centers specialize in selling plants and gardening materials, and would be the most appropriate place to purchase an apple tree sapling. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not provide any information about where to obtain an apple tree.
ask questions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the detective's task involves uncovering the truth, which often requires gathering information from witnesses. Asking questions is a common method of gathering information and can help the detective piece together the facts of the case. The other options may also be part of the detective's investigation, but they are not as directly related to gathering information from witnesses.
golf course | Knowledge: Well-manicured lawns are typically associated with places that prioritize upkeep and aesthetics. Golf courses are known for their pristine landscapes and manicured greens, making them a likely choice for a location with a well-manicured lawn. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of a well-manicured lawn.
repercussions | Knowledge: The question suggests that if someone does not agree with your expression, there will be some kind of consequence or negative outcome, which is often referred to as a repercussion. Miscommunication, embarrassment, and misunderstanding may also occur, but they are more likely to be a result of a lack of clarity or understanding in the expression itself. Empowerment, on the other hand, is a positive outcome that is not likely to occur if someone disagrees with your expression.
draw pictures | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan's job was solely focused on answering phone calls, which implies that he did not have time or opportunity to engage in any other activities while working. The option "draw pictures" is the only choice that represents an activity unrelated to Dan's job, and therefore it is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
talk to people | Knowledge: In the context of therapy, communication usually refers to expressing one's thoughts and feelings openly and honestly. Talking to people directly is a common way to do this, which is why it is likely that the therapist suggested this approach. Writing in code or sending emails may not allow for the same level of emotional expression or connection with others, while listening is important but does not necessarily solve the problem of expressing oneself. "Talk with people" can be a valid alternative, but "talk to people" is a more commonly used phrase in this context.
chair | Knowledge: The question is asking where it is appropriate to place an attache case, which suggests that the answer should be a location where someone might need to temporarily place and store their attache case. The options "business meeting," "hospital," and "lawyer's office" are all locations where people may need to bring an attache case, but it is not clear where in those locations it would be appropriate to place it. "Chair" is the best answer because it is a piece of furniture that someone can place an attache case on while still keeping it within reach, and "professional" is not a location, but rather a general descriptor that does not help answer the question.
airports | Knowledge: Baggage searches are commonly conducted at airports as part of security measures for air travel. Helicopters, cruise ships, train stations, and rooms are all unlikely places for baggage searches to take place, as they do not have the same level of security protocols in place as airports do.
California | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a specific location is known for its red suspension bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge, located in California, is a famous example of a red suspension bridge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feline | Knowledge: The question is asking for a synonym for "cat," which is a type of animal. The word "feline" refers specifically to the family of cats, so it is the correct answer. The other options do not relate to cats at all - "lazy," "hungry," and "thirsty" are adjectives describing a state, and "four legs" is a physical characteristic of many animals but is not a name for a specific type of animal.
pool of blood | Knowledge: This question suggests that a violent act has occurred, specifically a stabbing that is likely to result in a pool of blood forming on the ground. The other options are not related to the context of the question and can be eliminated. Being arrested and imprisonment may be consequences of committing the violent act, but they are not related to the physical result of the action. A garden is not relevant to the context at all. The use of the word "gruesome" may be related to the violent and bloody nature of the act, but it is not a specific result and doesn't answer the question directly.
notoriety | Knowledge: The question suggests that telling many people about someone's escapades will have a specific outcome. The word "escapades" suggests that these are adventurous or risky activities that may not be socially acceptable. Therefore, it is likely that telling many people about these activities would lead to the person becoming well-known for their behavior, which is the definition of notoriety. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
mind | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cause of Sam's confusion is related to something he suffered, which is most likely a mental or emotional condition. The word "mind" is the only option that fits this category. The other options do not have any clear connection to mental or emotional suffering.
red green | Knowledge: The RGB model stands for "red, green, blue" and is a color model used for digital displays such as computer screens. Therefore, the correct answer is "red green." The other choices are colors or color combinations but are not related to the specific RGB model.
sex | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the activity being described is intimate and involves physical contact with another person. Additionally, the mention of being naked further supports the idea of sexual activity. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not necessarily involve physical contact with another person or being naked.
have strength | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lifting weights can improve one's wrestling skills. This is because lifting weights helps to build strength, which is an important factor in wrestling. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
fun | Knowledge: The sentence describes children engaging in physical activity and showing signs of enjoyment, such as laughing. The word "fun" is commonly associated with activities that are enjoyable and entertaining, particularly for children. The other options do not make sense in the context of children playing and having a good time.
turning off | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the action to be taken after finishing with the television is related to its usage. Based on this, the most logical answer would be to turn it off as this is a common action taken when one finishes using a television. The other options are either unrelated or illogical given the context.
win | Knowledge: The question is asking for an action that leads to winning while competing. The options "sweat," "perform better," and "tension" describe aspects of competing but not necessarily actions that lead to winning. "Winning or losing" is a statement but not an action. "Win" is the correct answer as it directly describes the action of achieving victory in a competition.
feel tired | Knowledge: Running a marathon (26 miles) is a physically demanding activity that can cause fatigue and exhaustion. The phrase "what does someone feel" indicates that the question is asking about a subjective experience. While sore feet may be a common consequence of running a marathon, it is not necessarily the primary feeling one would have. Death is obviously not a common outcome of running a marathon. "Twenty six" is not a feeling, it is simply the distance of the marathon. Short breath may be experienced during the run, but the question is asking about the post-run feeling.
eating | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the insects were exposed to DDT through ingestion, i.e. by eating it. DDT is an insecticide that is often used to control pests in agriculture, and it can accumulate in the food chain, making it toxic for animals that consume it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animals were engaging in natural behaviors without any sense of embarrassment, which may imply that they were not performing any unusual or inappropriate actions. The fact that they were near water and occasionally dipped in further supports the idea that they may have been bathing. The other options (feel pain, die of cancer, copulate, attack) do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not related to the behaviors of animals by water.
fall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being on a high cliff grants a reaching advantage, but also presents a danger of falling. The context of the sentence implies that the answer should be related to safety or caution. The options "better negotiating position," "victory," "being ahead," and "eat" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence, leaving "fall" as the correct answer.
school | Knowledge: The use of the words "sports and academic trophy cases" implies that the location is likely to be an educational institution, such as a school or a college. The phrase "entrance hall" also suggests a public building where people come and go frequently, making a school or a college a likely option. The other options, such as a large home or a convention center, do not fit the context provided in the sentence. The option "hat rack" is clearly not fitting for the context.
front yard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mailbox is located in a place that is easily accessible from the road, which is commonly associated with mailboxes being placed in front yards. Front yards are often visible from the street and easily accessible, making them an ideal location for a mailbox. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
brain exercise | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man enjoyed doing puzzles for a specific purpose, which is likely to improve his mental abilities or keep his mind sharp. The option "mentally challenged" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it implies that the man struggles with mental disabilities. The options "challenging" and "pass time" both offer potential reasons why someone might enjoy doing puzzles, but they do not specifically address the man's motivation. Therefore, the best answer is "brain exercise."
glass | Knowledge: The question is asking about a drinking vessel that can overflow if filled with too much water. The context of the question suggests that the vessel is small enough to be held easily and used for drinking. Out of the choices given, only "glass" fits this description. The other options (riverbed, sewer, drain, creek) are all larger bodies of water and not suitable for a drinking vessel.
lie | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a real estate agent may resort to dishonesty in order to achieve a sale. This is supported by the fact that greed is mentioned, which implies a desire for personal gain at any cost. Lying is a common tactic used by unscrupulous salespeople, including real estate agents, to make a property more attractive to buyers. The other options do not relate to the negative connotations associated with greed and dishonesty.
ship | Knowledge: Marine grade steel cable is known for its corrosion resistance and durability in harsh maritime environments, making it ideal for use on ships. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
last forever | Knowledge: The phrase "in love" suggests a deep emotional connection between two people, and the question is referring to what happens after they get married. "Last forever" is a common sentiment associated with marriage and the hope is that the relationship will endure for a lifetime. "Reproduce" is a possibility, but not necessarily a guarantee or expectation of all married couples. "Hurt" and "obstruct justice" have no clear connection to the question asked. "Get" is too general and doesn't provide any specific information about what happens after the couple is married.
office building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that an adult may receive payment to sit at a desk, which is a common scenario in office buildings where people work desk jobs. Libraries and schoolrooms also have desks, but adults may not typically be paid to sit at those desks unless they are librarians or teachers. Bathrooms and garage sales do not typically involve paid desk work.
meet new people/make friends | Knowledge: When starting a new job, it is common to socialize with colleagues in order to build relationships and establish a sense of camaraderie. Meeting new people and making friends can create a supportive and enjoyable work environment, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and productivity. Small talk and talking to people are general reasons for socializing that do not specifically apply to starting a new job, while getting a raise is not typically a reason for socializing.
office | Knowledge: The question is related to working from home, so it suggests that there is a specific room that is being used for this purpose. The options bedroom and bathroom are unlikely to have a side chair for work purposes, and building and table are not specific enough. The option office is the most appropriate as it is a room usually associated with work and may have a side chair for additional seating.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people tend to keep their medicine in a specific location, and the most logical option would be the bathroom because it is a private and easily accessible space. Additionally, many medications need to be taken with water or other liquids, which are typically found in a bathroom. While medicines can also be found in a kitchen or stored in a jar, these options are less likely given the context of the sentence. A doctor's office or hospital would not be locations where people would typically keep their medicine.
market | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is asking about a place where fish are sold. While fish can be found in oceans and streams, it is unlikely that they would be for sale there. Refrigerators are used to store food, but not to sell it. "Pay debts" does not have any relevance to the question. A market, on the other hand, is a common location where fish (and other types of food) are sold.
chicken coop | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the weasel stole the chicken eggs from the farm, which suggests that the weasel was likely near a chicken coop. The fact that the weasel made its escape through something tall further supports the idea that it was near the coop, as chicken coops are typically enclosed by tall fences to protect the chickens from predators like weasels. The other options - children's story, animated film, and corn fields - have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
inhale | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that smoking certain drugs will not have the desired effect without a proper action. Inhaling is the necessary action needed to properly consume drugs through smoking. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the action needed to consume the drugs properly.
go to jail | Knowledge: The use of the word "guilty" in the sentence suggests that the defendant has been found guilty of a crime, and therefore the most logical consequence would be for them to go to jail. The other options do not make sense in the context of a guilty verdict and a defendant being cuffed.
on time | Knowledge: The question implies that using a driving car has a positive outcome, which narrows down the choices to "stop sign," "car crash," "pollution," and "on time." Out of those options, only "on time" is a positive result that could be achieved by using a car. The other options are negative outcomes that could result from using a car inappropriately or unsafely.
spacecraft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the structure had to escape the Earth's gravity, which is a characteristic commonly associated with spacecraft. The launching platform is also a clue, as spacecraft typically rely on rockets to lift off from a platform. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
transportation | Knowledge: Cars are commonly used for transportation purposes, whether it be for daily commutes, running errands, or traveling long distances. While cars may provide a sense of relaxation for some individuals, this is not their primary purpose. Car crashes may occur while driving, but this is not a reason for someone to intentionally drive a car. Similarly, driving a car does not typically involve sleeping or reducing stress.
sickness | Knowledge: Drinking alcohol can lead to various physical and mental effects, including impaired coordination, memory loss, and emotional instability. One of the most common and immediate effects of drinking alcohol is physical sickness, including nausea, vomiting, and headaches. This is due to the fact that alcohol is a toxin that can irritate the lining of the stomach and the digestive tract. The other options, such as blackouts, getting arrested, getting pregnant, and bad breath, do not necessarily occur immediately after drinking alcohol.
celebrating | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the team member would be experiencing some sort of emotional response after winning a baseball game. The other options, such as sensation or recognition, do not fit the context of the situation. While happiness and pride may be emotions a team member feels after a win, celebrating is the most specific option that directly relates to the act of celebrating a victory.
shelf  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kid is studying at home in the kitchen, so the most likely place for a dictionary would be in a shelf or bookcase in their home. The other options are less likely because they are not directly related to the context of the sentence. A dictionary could be found in a library, but the sentence does not provide any indication that the child is currently at a library. Similarly, while a table or classroom could potentially have a dictionary, the sentence does not provide any information to support these options. A bookstore may have a dictionary for sale, but the sentence suggests that the child is already studying new words, so they likely already have a dictionary available.
with cat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is not fond of dogs, which implies that they may prefer another type of pet. The option "with cat" is the best choice as it provides an alternative choice for a pet. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
compliments | Knowledge: Compliments are often a source of positive reinforcement and can make a person feel good about themselves. This positive feeling may lead to a smile. On the other hand, headache and pain are unlikely to make a person smile as they are associated with discomfort. Understanding oneself and owning a house may bring a sense of satisfaction, but it is not necessarily related to making a person physically smile.
shortness of breath | Knowledge: Intense exercise can cause an increase in the demand for oxygen in the body, which can lead to shortness of breath as the lungs work harder to supply enough oxygen to the body. This is a common physiological response to intense exercise and is not necessarily a cause for concern unless it persists or is accompanied by other symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sky | Knowledge: Birds are known for their ability to fly, which allows them to soar high up in the sky and move freely. The other options, such as a forest or nest, suggest a confined or stationary space which does not align with the idea of freedom. The ocean may be a large space but it is not a natural environment for birds to fly in, whereas the sky is their natural habitat.
loss of job | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that not returning to work could have negative consequences. "Sobering" and "anxiety" may be emotional reactions to this situation, but they do not explain the specific consequences. "Stress" may be a consequence, but it is not as severe as losing one's job. "Earn money" is a potential goal of returning to work, but it does not answer the question or describe a consequence of not returning to work.
light house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed a light source to navigate a spiral staircase, which is a feature commonly found in lighthouses. Lighthouses are tall structures that guide ships through dangerous waters, and they often have spiral staircases leading up to the top of the tower. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fights | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the aggressive soldiers were becoming intoxicated and that they were in the company of locals. Given that they are already described as aggressive, it is likely that they may engage in fights with the locals while under the influence of alcohol. The other options do not have any clear association to the context of the sentence.
dinner | Knowledge: Corn on the cob is typically served as a side dish during dinner meals, especially during summer cookouts or BBQs. It is less commonly served during breakfast or in supermarkets/shops, and the option "country" does not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
competition, injury, making a touchdown, losing, having fun | Knowledge: Playing ball can have a variety of outcomes, including both positive (making a touchdown, having fun) and negative (injury, losing) ones. Competition is also a potential outcome, as many ball games involve teams competing against each other. Understanding the context and purpose of playing ball can also aid in choosing the correct answer. For example, if the question is asking about the potential outcomes of playing ball as a leisure activity, then having fun may be the most likely answer. However, if the question is asking about the potential outcomes of playing ball in a competitive setting, then competition, winning, and losing may be more relevant answers.
own resources | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe had some kind of advantage or influence at the company due to his connections. The option "own resources" refers to Joe having his own valuable assets or personal resources that could be utilized for the company's benefit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
accomplishment | Knowledge: The question is asking about the end result or purpose of working hard towards a goal. The word "accomplishment" refers to successfully completing a task or achieving a goal, and is therefore the correct answer. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as they do not directly relate to the achievement of a goal.
rock band | Knowledge: The sentence provides information about each person's musical role, with John playing a stringed instrument, Billy as the singer, James as the drummer, and Vince playing the keyboard and piano. These roles are typically found in a rock band, which often includes these instruments. The other options, such as string quartet or music store, do not fit the description given in the sentence. Bored is also not a likely option, as the sentence does not suggest that the individuals were feeling uninterested or unengaged. Concert is a possibility, but it is too broad of a category without additional context.
cleverest | Knowledge: The question is asking about an individual who is most likely to be successful. Out of the provided choices, the word "cleverest" is the most relevant, as intelligence is often associated with success. The other options - "bitterest," "representative," "bunny rabbit," and "corrupt" - do not have a clear connection to success.
high school band | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is reminiscing about his past experiences in high school. The phrase "playing cornet" implies that he was a musician, and "yearbook" suggests that he is looking at photos and memories from his high school years. The choice "high school band" makes sense as it connects with the context of the sentence, while the other options have no clear connection.
cook food  | Knowledge: The question is asking about what people do for their guests, which suggests something hospitable or welcoming. The sentence specifically mentions cooking, which is a common activity when hosting guests. While talking and learning from each other may also be social activities during a gathering, demanding justice does not seem relevant to the context. Share food may also be an option, but the use of the word "for" implies a more active role in preparing the food rather than just offering to share.
nose | Knowledge: The nose is the primary organ used for smelling things. It contains specialized cells that detect different types of odor molecules and sends signals to the brain, allowing us to identify and distinguish between different smells. The other options do not have any connection to the sense of smell or the question being asked.
cedar chest | Knowledge: A cedar chest is a common piece of furniture used for storing bedding, such as blankets and comforters. It is unlikely to find a comforter in a living room or outside, and it is inappropriate to find one in a baby's mouth. "World" is too broad and does not provide any context for where a comforter would be found.
state fair  | Knowledge: State fairs often have agricultural and livestock exhibitions, including horse shows. The other choices do not have a clear association with horse shows or public celebrations in general.
rocky hillside | Knowledge: The sentence implies that marmots have a natural habitat outside of buildings. It then gives five options, and the correct answer requires knowledge about marmot habitats. Marmots are burrowing mammals that are typically found in rocky mountainous areas, so the answer is likely to be the rocky hillside. The other options do not align with the natural habitat of marmots.
office | Knowledge: A rubber stamp is commonly used in office settings for tasks such as stamping documents or envelopes with a signature or company logo. While it is possible that a craft store or art class may use rubber stamps for creative purposes, these settings are not typically associated with using a signature stamp for official business. The state of Indiana is not relevant to the context of the question. The word "made" is too vague and doesn't provide any contextual clues as to where someone with a signature rubber stamp would work.
injury | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the all-star player wasn't playing at full capacity due to something that affected his physical condition. "Trauma" and "injury" are both related to physical harm or damage, which could explain why the player wasn't at his best. "Having fun" and "pleasure" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, and "throwing" does not seem to fit with the idea of an injury affecting the player's performance.
many products | Knowledge: The question asks for something that is commonly made of nylon, which is a synthetic polymer material that is known for its strength, durability, and elasticity. While women's leggings are one specific product that is commonly made of nylon, the word "other" in the question implies that there are other items as well. Nylon is used in a wide range of products, including stockings, ropes, shoes, and many other things. Therefore, the correct answer is "many products".
go to market | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people are looking to purchase fruit, and the most likely place for them to do so is at a market. Markets are commonly associated with selling fresh produce, including fruits and vegetables. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
direct sunlight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is looking for shade, which means he is probably in a place where the sun is shining directly on him. The options "sunny place," "summer," "bright sunshine," and "full sunlight" all describe sunny conditions, but only "direct sunlight" specifically refers to being in the path of the sun's rays.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's garbage can is blocking something that is causing annoyance to other people. The most likely option is the street since garbage cans are usually placed on the street for garbage trucks to pick up. The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
demands were met | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that union workers were on strike and then they went off strike. This means that their demands, which caused the strike in the first place, must have been met by the management. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. If the company had closed, the union workers would not have gone off strike. If the management had given more money, the union workers would have been happy and not gone on strike in the first place. If complaints had been addressed, there would have been no reason for the strike to continue. If the union workers had been told to get back to work without their demands being met, they would not have complied.
earning money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is working hard in order to provide for themselves or their family, indicating a desire or need for financial stability. The option "earning money" best fits this context, while the other choices do not make sense in relation to the sentence. "Prosperity" could be a potential answer, but it is too broad and not specific enough in this context.
like heat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cats are laying by the refrigerator for a particular reason. One possible reason is that they like the warmth given off by the appliance. Cats are known to seek out warm places to rest, and refrigerators often emit heat from the compressors on their backs. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the cats are laying by the refrigerator.
closed container | Knowledge: The question is asking where glue will stay usable, which implies that there are certain conditions that will keep the glue in good condition. The correct answer is "closed container" because once opened, glue can dry out or harden if left exposed to air. This is why it's important to keep glue tightly sealed when not in use. The other options, such as "art room" or "desk drawer," don't necessarily provide the necessary conditions for preserving the glue's usability. "Sticky" is not a location and "cabinet" gives no indication of whether the container is open or closed, so these options can be eliminated.
irritation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police chief had to answer questions from the press for a long time, which could be a frustrating and exhausting experience. The word "hours" implies that it was a prolonged period of time, which adds to the likelihood that the police chief felt irritated. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that the police chief felt sad, polite, teaching, or detective-like after answering questions from the press.
opening | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mal is doing something to cover a hole at night, but he is also leaving something for his cats. Since cats often require access to certain areas of the house for their litter boxes or food and water bowls, it is reasonable to assume that Mal is leaving an opening or access point for his cats. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence.
petting zoo | Knowledge: A marmot is a type of ground squirrel that is typically found in mountainous areas and other remote wilderness habitats. Therefore, a marmot would feel most confined in a petting zoo, which is an artificial environment that is far removed from its natural habitat. The other options are all places where a marmot could potentially live or thrive.
last 100 years | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sam's life started in 1918, and he is reflecting on his long life. Since the current year is 2021, it can be inferred that Sam has lived for at least 100 years. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
suburban neighborhood | Knowledge: A suburban neighborhood typically consists of houses with backyards, so it is possible for there to be thousands or even millions of back gardens in a large suburban area. Apartments usually do not have individual backyards, and cities in general may have limited space for individual gardens. While England may have many suburban neighborhoods, it is not a defining characteristic of the country itself.
fishing gear  | Knowledge: The word "net" is commonly associated with fishing, as it is a tool used to catch fish. The other options do not have any clear connection to the word "net".
all choices are correct | Knowledge: Each of the choices suggests a way to avoid feeling lonely while out for coffee by engaging in social interaction with others, either by meeting new people or spending time with existing friends. The question does not provide enough context to narrow the answer down to a single correct choice.
friendly | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that John drove interesting people away, implying that he did or said something that caused them to not want to be around him. Being more social or exploring may help him meet more people, but it is unlikely to address the issue of driving them away. Taking a class or trying to understand people better may be helpful, but being friendly is the most straightforward way to make people feel comfortable around him.
encyclopedia | Knowledge: In this sentence, the grandpa is trying to show the child what a mammoth is. The most likely source of information in this context would be an encyclopedia, which is a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of topics, including prehistoric animals like mammoths. The other options do not make sense in this context - ancient times and excavations might be related to the subject matter, but they are not things that the grandpa would bring out to show the child. South Dakota and backyard do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
great oceans | Knowledge: The sentence implies that sharks can be found in a variety of locations, and the term "great oceans" refers to the world's largest bodies of saltwater, such as the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Sharks are known to inhabit these waters and can pose a threat to humans who encounter them. The other choices, such as "tropical waters," "sea world," "great outdoors," and "Lake Michigan" are not accurate because they do not encompass where sharks are typically found.
car show | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John was putting in extra effort to make his vehicle look its best, which suggests that he was preparing it for public display. Additionally, the option "car show" specifically mentions an event where people showcase their cars, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "home" or "repair shop," do not provide a reason for why John would be spending so much time polishing his tires.
play cards | Knowledge: The context suggests that the entertainment option should not require electricity, which rules out watching a film or seeing a favorite show. Playing chess may require a board and pieces, which may not be readily available, whereas playing cards only requires a deck of cards. Surfing the net requires electricity and an internet connection, which is not available in this scenario. Therefore, playing cards is the most appropriate option for entertainment in this situation.
atlantic ocean | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where there are millions of blowfish, which suggests that blowfish are found in large numbers in this location. The Atlantic Ocean is a large body of water that spans over several countries and is home to a diverse range of marine life, including blowfish. The other options, such as jungle, Cuba, sea water, and lake, do not have any clear association with blowfish or their habitat.
windowsill |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bird is outside the window, which could mean it is perched on a nearby object such as a windowsill. The other options do not make sense in this context, as a bird in a cage or a forest would not be at the window, and the countryside is too general of a location to determine where the bird might be sitting.
choir | Knowledge: The question is asking what can be made with one's voice, suggesting that it refers to a musical or vocal endeavor rather than a tool or technology like a radio or telephone. Silence is not something that can be made with one's voice. A song is a possible answer but not the only one, and there is a specific reference to a group effort with "you" implying a shared activity rather than an individual performance. A choir is a group of singers who perform together using their voices, making it the most likely answer among the choices.
important | Knowledge: Typically, books are written about people who have made significant contributions or accomplishments in their respective fields, or who are historically significant. These individuals are often referred to as "important" people, and their stories are considered worth telling. While it is possible for a book to be written about someone who is entertaining or engaging, these characteristics alone are not typically enough to warrant an entire book. Similarly, being rich or having a book written on paper do not necessarily have any bearing on whether or not someone is book-worthy.
stanza | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was set to perform something that had multiple lines or verses, and the issue was specifically with remembering the final one. A stanza is a group of lines in poetry or song lyrics, and it is common for performers to struggle with remembering the last one. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
believe in Jesus Christ | Knowledge: The question is asking what a Christian student would do if they are not good at learning. In this context, it is safe to assume that the answer should reflect the teachings of the Christian faith. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be "believe in Jesus Christ," as this is a core belief in Christianity and signifies a commitment to have faith that God will provide guidance and support in all aspects of life, including education. The other options, such as "fail" or "give up," are negative and suggest a lack of effort, while "commit sin" and "rebel" are inappropriate as solutions to academic challenges.
change yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that changing society requires some form of personal transformation or self-reflection. This idea aligns with the common belief that societal change begins with individual change. The other options are not necessarily required steps in changing society, and in some cases, may even be counterproductive. For example, riots may lead to destruction and violence, which would not be an effective means of changing society in most cases.
choir | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is talented in both singing alto and playing an instrument, and that he is involved in a group or organization that involves both activities. The word "choir" is the most logical choice because it is a musical group that involves singing and often includes musical accompaniment. The other options, while involving music in some way, do not necessarily involve singing or playing an instrument in combination.
fishing rod, access to water, and bate | Knowledge: Fishing typically requires a fishing rod to cast a line and reel in a fish, access to water where fish are present, and bate to attract the fish. Having three hands or tackle is not necessary for fishing and is not mentioned in the context of the question.
write programs | Knowledge: Computer science is a field that involves programming and computer systems. Therefore, it is logical to assume that someone who majors in computer science would be interested in a career that involves writing programs or developing software. The other options have no clear connection to the field of computer science.
doctor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you want expert information about germs, you should talk to a certain type of person. The most likely expert on germs would be a doctor, as they have extensive medical training and should be knowledgeable about the spread of disease. The other options either do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not likely to be experts on germs.
pet shops | Knowledge: While snakes can be found in tropical forests and fields, these are not locations where one typically buys a pet snake. Walmart is a retail store that may sell some pet supplies, but it is unlikely to be a primary source for purchasing snakes. On the other hand, pet shops are commonly known to sell a variety of reptiles, including snakes, making it the most likely choice for where to buy a pet snake.
bring home | Knowledge: When a person buys food from a grocery store, the typical action is to bring the food home. This is because the food is usually intended for consumption at home. The other options do not make sense in the context of buying food from a grocery store.
jar | Knowledge: Since honey is a liquid, the most practical option for storing it would be in a jar with a lid. This will prevent the honey from spilling or attracting pests like ants. The other options do not make sense in the context of storing honey. "Stick to fingers" is not a storage option but rather a result of handling honey. "Farmer's market" refers to a place where goods are sold but not stored. "Beehive" is where bees produce honey rather than where it's stored. "House" is too broad and does not answer the question specifically.
pay attention | Knowledge: When a teacher asks their students to "listen," it typically means that they want the students to focus and actively engage with what is being said. The other options may be related to listening, but they do not fully capture the meaning of actively engaging with someone speaking to you. For example, being able to hear simply means that sound reaches your ears, but it doesn't necessarily suggest active engagement with the speaker. Similarly, having your eyes on the teacher may show that you are physically present and looking in their direction, but it doesn't necessarily capture the idea of actively listening and engaging with them.
emotions | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that every person has that allows them to feel, which suggests that it is related to the ability to experience emotions. The other options (mother and father, heart, name, mouth) do not have a clear connection to the concept of feeling.
confusing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Simon's instructions were hard to understand, which can be described as confusing. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not accurately describe the difficulty of understanding instructions.
motorbike | Knowledge: The use of a chain to move the back wheel is a common feature of motorcycles, also known as motorbikes. The other options, such as cars and tow trucks, typically use a driveshaft or other mechanical systems to power the wheels, while bicycles are powered by pedals. The term "gear shift" can apply to a range of vehicles and does not provide clear information about the type of vehicle being described.
have money | Knowledge: The question is asking what is necessary in order to buy presents for others, which implies a need for a certain amount of money. The options "spend money" and "earn money" suggest actions that can lead to having money, but do not guarantee the presence of money. "Generosity" and "generous" suggest a willingness to give, but do not address the practical matter of having the means to give. Therefore, the correct answer is "have money" as it directly addresses the requirement for purchasing gifts.
imaginary | Knowledge: The phrase "taken aback" suggests that the woman was surprised or shocked by something unexpected. The sentence implies that her previous boyfriends were not like the man she is currently interacting with, which suggests that they may have been imaginary or fictional. The word "imaginary" is the most fitting answer as it describes something that exists only in the imagination or mind. The other choices, such as fictitious or artificial, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
communicate | Knowledge: The other options may be related to a couple's relationship, but the sentence specifically mentions something that is important for them to do. Communication is often cited as a crucial aspect of a healthy and successful relationship. The other options may also be important, but they don't necessarily address the importance of communication in the same way.
cool off | Knowledge: The phrase "hot weather was unbearable" implies that the person is experiencing discomfort due to the temperature. To alleviate this discomfort, the person needs to find a way to reduce their body temperature. Options like "eat ice cream" and "lemonade" provide temporary relief, but they don't actually cool the body. "Swim" could provide relief, but it's not clear whether the person has access to a pool or body of water. "Cut hair" is not relevant to the context. "Cool off" is the most logical choice as it directly addresses the need to reduce body temperature.
clay pot | Knowledge: Ficus plants require well-draining soil and good air circulation around their roots. Clay pots are a popular choice for planting ficus because they allow excess moisture to evaporate and provide good air flow. Refrigerators and shady places would not be appropriate for a plant that needs sunlight to thrive. A screened porch or arboretum could be suitable locations for a ficus, but the question is specifically about the container needed, not the location of the plant.
injuries | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Bobby's action of jumping off the slide had negative consequences when he landed. The word "injuries" suggests physical harm or damage, which makes sense in the context of jumping off a playground slide. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the words "glee" and "being happy" have a positive connotation that does not fit with the idea of Bobby's action having negative consequences.
wrinkled skin | Knowledge: When skin is exposed to water for prolonged periods of time, it can become wrinkled due to water absorption. This is a common physiological response and is not harmful in moderate amounts. The other options do not have any relation to the physiological effects of prolonged exposure to water.
injury | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the performer fell off the stage, which implies that they sustained some form of physical harm. Injury is therefore the most logical choice among the options given. Fear and butterflies are emotions that are unlikely to be caused by falling off a stage, while pride and action do not relate to the negative outcome suggested by the sentence.
soccer game | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that coaches are commonly seen in a specific type of event or activity that is likely associated with either European or South American culture. The options "play football," "sporting event," and "soccer game" are all related to sports, which are popular in both regions. However, football (or soccer) is especially popular in Europe and South America, making "soccer game" the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
church | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions a sermon, which is typically associated with religious settings like churches. Folding chairs are commonly used in churches for events like sermons, so it is likely that the setting in this sentence is a church. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hideous | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not find themselves beautiful despite being told otherwise. The word "hideous" implies a strong negative feeling towards one's appearance. The other options do not convey a strong negative connotation and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
internet | Knowledge: The internet is a common tool for finding companies nowadays. It allows for easy access to company websites, directories, and online reviews. The other options are less commonly used, and some (such as armed forces) are not related to finding companies at all. Yellow pages and phone books were frequently used in the past but are becoming increasingly obsolete with the rise of digital technology.
british columbia | Knowledge: The question specifically mentions that beavers are native to the northwest of North America, which includes Canada. British Columbia is a province located in the westernmost part of Canada and is known for its extensive forests, making it a likely habitat for beavers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
theater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam had tickets to a concert hall, which is typically associated with loud music. Sam did not like going to the concert hall because of the loud noise, which suggests that he may prefer a quieter setting for entertainment. A theater often offers a more controlled environment with softer sounds, making it a reasonable choice for Sam to trade his tickets for. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
exceptional | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although Susan was an ordinary person, her skills were not ordinary, which implies that her skills were above average or outstanding. The word "exceptional" fits this context as it means unusually good, outstanding, or remarkable. The other options like "strange" or "unusual" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Spectacular" and "special" are not necessarily negative, but they do not have the same connotation of being outstanding or exceptional that the sentence implies.
northern climates | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in colder regions such as the mountains of Europe, Asia, and North America. They prefer alpine and subalpine habitats, which are found in northern climates. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
laugh or scare | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy enjoys surprising his mother, which could either result in her laughing or being scared. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would not make sense in the given context.
gymnasium | Knowledge: Bleachers are often associated with seating in a gymnasium or other indoor sports facility. They are typically arranged in rows to maximize seating capacity and provide a clear view of the playing area. The other options do not involve indoor seating or sports facilities.
playground | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James and Sarah were looking for an alternative place to spend their time because their usual spot was muddy. The word "playground" is the only option that fits this description, as it is a common outdoor area where people go to have fun and play. The other options, such as "highway", "town", and "mexico", do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for comfort and familiarity, which is often associated with one's own home. Home is a place where a person can feel safe, secure, and comfortable, surrounded by their own belongings and familiar surroundings. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not offer the same level of comfort and familiarity as home.
mountains | Knowledge: The keyword "cold" in the question suggests that the animal being referred to is adapted to living in cooler temperatures. The keyword "tall" suggests that the animal may be adapted to living at higher elevations. Marmosets are typically found in the mountains of Central and South America, which are relatively cooler and higher in elevation compared to other areas listed in the answer choices. The other options do not have a clear association with the habitat preferences of a marmoset.
Australia | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "outback tour guide," which suggests that the location being referred to is in Australia, as the term "outback" is commonly associated with that country. Additionally, the mention of prairie dogs ties them to North America, which further supports the idea that the speaker is in a different location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
subway | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James dislikes using something that involves being underground or buried in dirt. The option "subway" fits this context as it is a mode of transportation that often involves underground tunnels. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is looking for a place to have a drink and watch comedy. While one could potentially have a drink and watch comedy at a dinner or show, these options are less common than going to a bar or comedy club. The cinema and refrigerator are not logical options since one does not typically watch live comedy in either of those locations.
already knew | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the surprise party was unsuccessful because the guest of honor already knew about it. The other options do not fit with the sentence since they do not suggest that the guest of honor was aware of the party beforehand. "Foreshadowed" suggests that the party was hinted at beforehand, "sneaky" suggests the party-throwers were secretive in their planning, and "hiding" suggests the guest of honor was hiding from the party.
misfire | Knowledge: When guns get wet, the water may cause the gunpowder to become damp and less effective, leading to misfires or failure to fire. Explosions are rare and usually only occur if the gun is severely damaged or if the ammunition has been tampered with. Jams can occur if debris or moisture gets into the gun's action, causing it to malfunction. Guns can break if they are not properly maintained, but it is not a common occurrence when they get wet. "Take life" is not a potential effect on the gun itself but instead an outcome of the gun being fired.
settle down | Knowledge: The sentence implies that buying a house is a significant step towards establishing a permanent home for one's family, which is often associated with the idea of "settling down." "Make money" and "lose money" are not related to the context of buying a house for the family, while "closet space" and "pay for" are possible considerations when buying a house but do not capture the overall purpose of the decision.
available | Knowledge: The phrase "out of stock" implies that the product was not available for purchase. Therefore, if the product has been restocked, it is now available once again. The other choices, such as "plenty," "empty," and "abundant," do not suggest that the product is available for purchase again. "Plentiful" and "plenty" suggest that there is a large amount of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase. "Empty" implies that there is nothing left or available, and "abundant" suggests that there is a lot of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase.
happy | Knowledge: The question asks about the emotional response a person should feel when performing a responsible action with their pet, specifically walking a dog. Walking a dog is a healthy activity for both the dog and the owner, and spending time with a beloved pet can boost feelings of happiness and satisfaction. The other options, such as sore feet, tiredness, and exercise, may be physical outcomes of walking a dog, but do not necessarily relate to the emotional response that a person should feel. Pride may be a positive emotion associated with being a responsible pet owner, but is not necessarily linked to the act of walking a dog.
laughter | Knowledge: The word "entertaining" suggests that the show was enjoyable to Jane. Since the other emotions listed are negative or neutral, it can be inferred that Jane experienced a positive emotion while watching the show. "Laughter" is commonly associated with enjoyment and entertainment, and it fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context.
motion | Knowledge: Escalators are typically distinguished from stairs based on their ability to move. Unlike stairs, which are stationary, escalators have a motorized mechanism that causes them to move in a continuous motion, bringing people up or down. The other options, such as "eat cake" or "department store," do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
hell | Knowledge: The word "crash" in the context of a computer typically refers to a sudden, unforeseen failure or malfunction. This can be frustrating and disruptive, leading to feelings of anger or despair. As such, the choice "hell" is a likely option for a computer user's perspective on a computer crash. The other options (own home, school, work, house) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bridge | Knowledge: The fact that Sam was an alcoholic and was injured in a car crash suggests that the crash was likely related to his drinking. Bridges are often associated with drinking and driving accidents, as they are typically located on busy roads or highways and can be more difficult to navigate when impaired. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence contrasts Mars with something that has a variety of features, which suggests that the correct answer must also have a diverse range of components. The surface of Earth contains a variety of materials, such as soil, rocks, water, and vegetation, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not have diverse features (e.g. potato and desktop), or are unrelated to the topic (e.g. library and most buildings).
punishment | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the racer received a penalty for leaving the line early, which is a violation of the rules. The penalty for a false start is usually a punishment, such as a time penalty or a disqualification, rather than arguing or trouble. The official's countdown may not have any effect on the punishment, although it could result in further delays if the racer continues to make false starts. Starting over is unlikely to be an option, as the race has already begun.
Louisiana | Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific state that is known for its BBQ. "Delta state" may refer to a state located in the Mississippi Delta region, which includes Louisiana. Louisiana is known for its Cajun-style BBQ, which is heavily influenced by French, African, and Native American cuisine. The other options do not provide any information that would suggest they are known for BBQ.
landscaping | Knowledge: Rosebushes are often used as decorative plants in landscaping, such as in gardens, parks, and along walkways. Courtyards and botanic gardens may also have rosebushes, but the word "typically" suggests that landscaping is the most common location. Mailboxes and California have no clear connection to rosebushes.
wake up | Knowledge: The question is asking about the first thing a spouse might do when they get up early, which implies that the spouse is already awake. Therefore, options that involve going to bed early or getting to bed early do not make sense. Additionally, asking the spouse to wake up does not fit the context of the sentence, which suggests that the spouse is already awake. Therefore, the correct answer is "wake up."
rainforest | Knowledge: Marmosets are small primates that are typically found in the tropical rainforests of South America. The other choices are not associated with the natural habitat of marmosets. France is a country, but it is not known for having marmosets. Trees, wilderness, and mountains are all natural features, but they do not provide information about where marmosets come from.
historical | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in modern times, there is a classification given to buildings to protect them from being town down. This classification is intended to protect buildings that are significant in history, which implies that the correct answer must have something to do with history. Out of the options given, "historical" best fits the context. The other options allude to the age or style of the buildings, but they do not specifically refer to the significance of the buildings in history.
orchid | Knowledge: The sentence mentions fruit growing areas, and apple trees are commonly grown in these areas. Washington state is known for its apple orchards, farmland can contain apple trees, and grape vineyards may also have apple trees. Vineyards may be dedicated solely to grapes, but it is still possible to grow apple trees in the surrounding area. Orchid is not a fruit, and therefore would not be a likely location for an apple tree.
sanded | Knowledge: The sentence describes the man and woman chipping the wood for their garden, which would likely leave it with rough edges or surfaces. The word "then" suggests that the sentence is describing a subsequent action. Sanding is a common practice for smoothing rough surfaces, so it would make sense for the man and woman to sand the wood after chipping it. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
tropical rainforest | Knowledge: Sloths are native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where they spend much of their time sleeping in trees. The forest canopy is their natural habitat, and the damp climate of the rainforest provides the perfect environment for their slow-moving, relaxed lifestyle. The other options are less likely to be associated with sloths or their preferred habitats.
beer | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is a type of alcoholic beverage. Beer is commonly known to have an alcohol content of around 4.5%, while wine can range from 5-15% depending on the type. A pub is a place where alcoholic drinks are served, but it is not a specific type of drink. Uncle Joe and fraternity house are not relevant options in this context.
public building | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a city's Christmas party, which suggests a larger gathering that likely wouldn't be held in someone's home or automobile. The use of the term "public building" implies that the party was being held in a location such as a community center or town hall, as opposed to a privately-owned building like a house or train.
park | Knowledge: Parks often have large open spaces that can be used for recreational activities such as soccer. This is a common feature of many urban parks, which are designed specifically to provide residents with a place to relax and engage in physical activity. The other options do not offer the same level of open space or amenities that would make them suitable for a soccer field. Beaches, for example, are often crowded and have limited space, while playgrounds are typically designed for children and may not be large enough for a full-size soccer field. Mexico and the countryside are also unlikely to be viable options, as they are not specific locations and do not offer any particular advantages for building a soccer field in a crowded city.
bar | Knowledge: When someone is looking for a drink, they are typically referring to an alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine or a cocktail, which are commonly served in bars. China is a country, not a place where one would get a drink, and brothels and theaters are not typical places to get a drink unless they have a bar on site. A space shuttle does not serve drinks to its passengers.
new york city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Daily Planet and Jimmy's subway stop are both located in the same city. "New York City" is a well-known metropolis and home to the fictional Daily Planet from the Superman comics, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
harvesting | Knowledge: After a farmer has made things grow, the next step is usually to harvest the crops. Harvesting refers to the process of gathering mature crops from the fields and preparing them for sale or consumption. The other options may be related to the process of growing crops, but they are not the final step that a farmer would take. Flowering and blooms are stages of plant growth, planting is the initial step, and growth is a general term that could refer to any stage of the process.
good digestion | Knowledge: Digestion is the process by which our body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into our bloodstream and used for energy, growth, and repair. Good digestion is essential for the body to properly absorb nutrients and eliminate waste. Eating is the process of putting food in our mouth, and sore mouth and toothache are conditions that may affect the ability to chew and swallow food, but they do not affect the process of digestion itself. Aid digestion may refer to medications or supplements that assist the digestive process, but the sentence is not referring to these interventions.
response | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy called out to John with the expectation of hearing something in return, which is a characteristic commonly associated with seeking a response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
disregard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Ben doesn't have much respect for Sue and would act in a way that is contrary to her wishes. "Disregard" means to ignore or pay no attention to, which fits the context of the sentence. "Throw away" and "humiliate" do not fit the context and seem too extreme. "Being rude" is not specific enough and could apply to a variety of actions. "Abhor" means to hate or detest, which doesn't make sense in this context.
sound well | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person on the phone was sick and the speaker could no longer hear the sickness in their voice. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker said something positive or reassuring, such as "sound well." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
glass cage | Knowledge: A pet lizard should be kept in a glass cage or tank, as it provides a secure and controlled environment that allows for temperature regulation and protection from predators. The other options are either unsuitable habitats for most pet lizards (such as the desert or wild) or are not relevant to the context of the question (such as the Galapagos Archipelago or garden).
straight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's characteristic of being "kooky" has no relation to his sexual orientation, specifically not being gay. The word "straight" is commonly used to refer to someone who is heterosexual, so it is the best option that accurately describes Billy's sexual orientation based on the given sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feed themselves | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that people are having trouble finding enough resources to fulfill their calorie requirements, which suggests that they are struggling to obtain enough food. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is related to obtaining food. "Feed themselves" is the only option that directly mentions obtaining food, while the other options are either unrelated or imply conflict between people.
get tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence that occurs when people play sports for too long. Since the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, we can eliminate them. Running and cheating are both actions that could potentially happen during sports, but they are not necessarily related to the negative consequence mentioned in the sentence. Having fun is generally considered a positive outcome of playing sports, so it is also not a likely answer. Finally, breaking out in purple polka dots is an absurd option that is clearly meant to be humorous, but it does not provide any useful information for choosing the correct answer. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is getting tired, which is a common consequence of physical activity.
rain forest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animal being referred to is a monkey and that it is native to a place without people. Given this information, it is most likely that the monkey is found in a natural habitat rather than a research laboratory. The options "south africa" and "Canada" are geographic locations, but they do not provide any information on where monkeys can be found. "Playful mood" is not a place, and is not relevant to the question. "Rain forest" is a type of natural habitat, which is commonly associated with primates such as monkeys. Therefore, "rain forest" is the most appropriate answer.
fatigue | Knowledge: The sentence tells us that John did not like to get in line, which suggests that he was tired or exhausted from working for a long time. Fatigue is commonly associated with physical and mental exhaustion, which can make waiting in line feel more difficult and uncomfortable. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
answer question | Knowledge: The act of raising one's hand in a classroom setting typically indicates the desire to answer a question or provide a comment. The other options, such as completing a test, reading a book, or studying a book, do not involve raising one's hand in the same way that answering a question does. "Died" is clearly not a valid option as no one would raise their hand in response to someone dying.
desktop | Knowledge: Computer speakers are typically kept on the desktop, which is the surface on which the computer monitor and other hardware sits. This is because the speakers are designed to produce sound for the computer, so they need to be in close proximity to the user. The other options do not make sense in the context of where computer speakers would be kept.
infrequently | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally only rides her bike less than once per year, which implies that she does it very rarely or infrequently. The other options, such as sometimes, usually, seldom, and occasionally, do not accurately describe her bike-riding habits based on the given information.
slow down | Knowledge: Stop signs are used to regulate traffic flow and require drivers to come to a complete stop before proceeding. Therefore, slowing down is the appropriate action to take when approaching a stop sign. Going fast, rolling over, crashing, or flying are all unsafe and illegal actions that could result in serious consequences.
cemetary | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the excavation was related to a murder case, which implies that the location must be related to either the victim or the suspect. The option "cemetary" is the most likely answer as it is a common location for burial of bodies, including murder victims. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tropical areas | Knowledge: The word "hot" suggests that the monkeys prefer a warm climate. "Tropical areas" are known for having warm and humid weather, making it a suitable habitat for many monkey species. "Rain forest" may also be a suitable habitat for monkeys, but the choice of the word "hot" makes "tropical areas" a more likely answer. "Tree tops" and "treetops" are not habitats themselves, but rather a location within a habitat, and "great outdoors" is too broad of a term.
meeting | Knowledge: While books and classes are common sources of knowledge, the question asks for sources other than school or text. Meetings are a source of knowledge because they provide an opportunity for individuals to share their experiences and expertise with others. Meetings can also serve as a forum to discuss new ideas and learn from others. "Thinking" and "head" are not sources of knowledge, but rather describe a potential internal process.
fight enemy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the soldiers are preparing to confront the invading soldiers with hostility, which is commonly associated with fighting. The phrase "raise their rifles" also implies a readiness for combat. The other options do not fit the context and tone of the sentence, as they do not involve an aggressive or confrontational approach to the invading soldiers.
gather together | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common activity that people in a family do during holidays. Gathering together is a common tradition among families during holidays, where they come together to celebrate and spend time with each other. Getting angry or facing each other do not necessarily relate to holiday traditions, while running a race is a specific activity that not all families may do. Talking to each other may occur during holiday gatherings, but it is not unique to holiday traditions.
house | Knowledge: The question is asking about something that goes on the floor, and of the given options, "house" is the only item that would typically be placed on a floor. "Closet" and "pet shop" are places, "table" and "desk" are furniture pieces that typically go on a floor but not directly on it.
communicate with others | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that individuals who have difficulty communicating with others are struggling with the act of communicating itself. The options "listen," "speak out," and "talk to people" are all specific actions related to communication, but they do not encompass the concept of communication difficulty as a whole. "Talk with people" is a more accurate option, but it is redundant with the phrase "communicate with others." "Having confidence" may contribute to communication difficulty, but it is not the root cause.
compromises | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two sides work together to come closer, reaching a tentative agreement is the first result. This implies that compromises must be made in order to reach an agreement. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, and therefore are incorrect.
hall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabin is larger than it appears at first glance and is actually made up of multiple rooms. The word "connected" also implies that there is some sort of passageway or hallway that links these rooms together. The word "bunkrooms" suggests that the cabin may be used for lodging or sleeping arrangements, further supporting the idea that it is made up of multiple smaller rooms. The other options, such as palace, spacecraft, and villa, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
library | Knowledge: A card catalog is a system used by libraries to organize their materials, such as books, magazines or journals. Users can search for a particular item by author, title or subject and find its location within the library. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of a card catalog.
defeat | Knowledge: When people are competing, the main goal is usually to win. However, it is also possible to lose or be defeated. This outcome is often associated with feelings of disappointment, sadness, and frustration. The other options, such as enemies and humiliation, are not necessarily outcomes of competition in general and may not be directly related to the context of the sentence. Aggression and stress are potential effects of competition but are not necessarily outcomes in and of themselves.
airfield | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a plane on a runway with civilians inside, which suggests that the plane is most likely a civilian aircraft, as military aircraft rarely transport civilians. The word "bound" suggests that the plane is departing for a specific destination, which is most likely an airfield or airport. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
reflecting pool | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that water is being used as a mirror, which is a design feature commonly associated with reflecting pools. Reflecting pools are often used in landscape architecture to create a calm and reflective surface that enhances the aesthetic and natural beauty of a surrounding area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would not typically be used as a mirror in a design context.
desktop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Amy is sitting down and turning on her monitor to do work, which is most likely done on a desktop computer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that she is using a box, on a train, at an internet cafe, or viewing a bluescreen.
It depends on the context of the question. If the question is referring to a medical situation where someone was clinically dead but then revived, the correct answer would be "human experience." If the question is referring to supernatural or fictional scenarios, the correct answer could be different, such as "rebirth" or "zombie." Knowledge: The answer will depend on the context of the question and what is being referred to as "coming back from death."
play music | Knowledge: Performing in front of a large number of people is commonly associated with musicians playing music for a live audience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
for it to become worse and become infected | Knowledge: When an injury occurs, it is important to prevent it from becoming worse and becoming infected. Allowing an injury to become worse can lead to more damage to the affected area, making it harder to heal. Infection can also occur if the wound is not properly cleaned and protected. While hurting is a common symptom of an injury, it is not something that can necessarily be prevented. Similarly, bleeding may also occur as a natural response to an injury and cannot always be prevented. Cause death is an extreme outcome that is not typically associated with most injuries.
new look | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Van Gogh was worried about something related to the appearance of his painting. The phrase "appeared different" implies that the painting did not look the way he wanted it to. The option "new look" best fits this context as it suggests a change in appearance. The other options, such as "chickens" and "slashes" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
teachers | Knowledge: The question asks for who it is important to pay attention to when attending school. Teachers are an obvious answer because they are the ones who are responsible for teaching and imparting knowledge to students. Paying attention to teachers is critical for students to learn effectively and succeed in their academic pursuits. The other options, such as falling down, time, stupidity, and patience, are not relevant to the context of the question or the purpose of attending school.
sea of japan | Knowledge: The fugu blowfish is a type of fish that is generally found in the waters around Japan, particularly in the Sea of Japan. This fish is known for its toxic flesh, which can be deadly if not prepared properly, and is a delicacy in Japan. The other options, such as the Atlantic Ocean, fish market, or rock band, are clearly not related to the habitat of the fugu blowfish.
competence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to have a certain level of competence to receive government benefits while they are on disability. Competence refers to the ability to perform certain tasks or duties, or to possess certain skills, which may factor into eligibility for disability benefits. Qualification also suggests a similar idea, but competence is a more appropriate term in this context. Potence and information have no logical connection to the sentence.
aircraft | Knowledge: The use of the word "nose" suggests that the context is related to an aircraft, as the nose of an aircraft refers to the front part of the plane. The phrase "alarms went off" indicates that something went wrong, possibly with the aircraft's altitude or speed, which may trigger alarms in the cockpit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Nebraska | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the steak house is known for serving a particular side dish that originated from a specific state. The correct answer is likely to be a state that is known for its corn production. Nebraska, in particular, is known as the Cornhusker State and is one of the leading corn-producing states in the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tropical waters | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shark is unhappy in its current environment, which is likely a man-made tank. It implies that the shark wants to be in a more natural, open environment. The choices "sea world" and "great oceans" could both potentially fit, but "tropical waters" is a more specific and accurate answer, as many sharks are known to prefer warmer waters. "Tamales Bay" and "the key" do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
see at night | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the car is able to hunt in the dark, which implies that it has some ability to see in low light conditions. The only answer option related to this ability is "see at night." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are simply opposite in meaning to what is being discussed.
storage cabinet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests the bachelor stored the groceries in a place where they could be forgotten, which suggests a place in the home where he wouldn't see them often. The choice 'storage cabinet' makes the most sense, as it's a place where people commonly store non-perishables, such as canned goods and dried foods. The other options, like 'refrigerator' and 'car trunk', wouldn't make sense since the former is a place for perishables and the latter is an inconvenient place to store goods for everyday use.
arm themselves | Knowledge: The context suggests that people are scared and getting a gun as a response to that fear. The phrase "arm themselves" directly implies the act of acquiring a weapon for protection or defense. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and seem out of place.
being entertained | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to the experience of watching a film. The word "hoping" indicates that the person is looking for a particular outcome or emotional response. While insight may be a secondary goal for some viewers, the primary reason for watching a film is usually to be entertained. Fear and erection may be responses to certain types of films, but they are not universal goals for all viewers. Expectations may be a factor in choosing which film to watch, but they do not directly relate to the experience of watching the film itself.
trauma | Knowledge: The sentence implies that remembering a terrible event can have negative emotional consequences, which is commonly associated with the term "trauma." Trauma refers to a psychological response to a distressing event, such as a violent attack, natural disaster, or serious accident, that can cause long-lasting psychological distress. The other options do not reflect the negative emotional consequences of remembering a traumatic event.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "intermission," which is a term typically used in reference to a break during a performance or event. The fact that hot dogs were selling fast suggests that they were being sold at a venue where people were gathering for an event, such as a sporting event. The other options, including park, Disneyland, apartment, and cows, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
symphony | Knowledge: Flute is a musical instrument commonly used in orchestras and symphonies. While a park or music shop may have a flute player, it is less likely to specifically go there to watch someone play the flute. A musical instrument store may have flutes for sale but is not where one would go to watch a performance.
not awake | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Billy is going to sleep, which implies that he will not be awake for the next few hours. The other options may occur during sleep, but they do not accurately describe what Billy will be for the next few hours after he falls asleep. Snoring and sleepwalking are specific behaviors that may occur during sleep, but they do not describe the overall state of being asleep. Loss of consciousness and latency may refer to medical or psychological concepts related to sleep, but they do not accurately describe what Billy will be for the next few hours.
Alaska | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location of an apple tree in the North, which suggests a colder climate. Alaska is the northernmost state in the United States and has a subarctic climate, which makes it a likely location for a tree that requires cold temperatures to thrive. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
resenment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the old conservative people are not happy with the changes in society. Resentment is a feeling of anger or bitterness towards someone or something, often because of a perceived injustice. It fits best with the context of the sentence. Depression, hurt and anger may also be possible options, but they are less likely because they are not as directly related to the idea of resistance to change. Acceptance is unlikely as it implies the opposite of what is being described in the sentence.
fail | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequence of failing at something we attempt, implying that failure is a likely outcome. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequence of failing, and some options like "leave" and "get shunned" are not commonly associated with failure. "Trying" is not a consequence, but rather an action that leads to the possibility of either success or failure.
tingling | Knowledge: The sentence is suggesting that when someone goes into a deep trance and stops feeling attached to their body, they may experience a physical sensation. The word "tingling" is the only option that describes a physical sensation, which makes it the correct answer. The other options either refer to techniques used to enter a trance state (meditation, closed eyes) or negative side effects (loss of control, memory loss) that may occur during a trance.
prehistory | Knowledge: Mammoths are extinct animals that lived during prehistoric times, which is a period of history that dates back millions of years ago. It is not associated with any particular era or artist like Marwell comics or museum of natural history. Forests may have existed during prehistoric times, but this option is too broad to be a correct answer to the question.
pizza | Knowledge: The question is asking for an alternative to a hamburger, which is typically a type of fast food made from ground beef. Among the choices, only pizza is also a popular fast food alternative to hamburgers. Sandwiches are too broad of a category and could include hamburgers, while a restaurant or fast food restaurant could serve hamburgers as well. The option "mouth" is clearly a nonsensical choice.
excitement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning about science can cause a particular emotion. Smiles and feeling hot are not commonly associated with learning about science. Invent is a verb, not an emotion. Frustration might be a possible emotion, but the sentence uses the word "cause," which implies a positive emotion, and frustration is typically a negative emotion. Excitement is frequently associated with learning about science because it can inspire curiosity, wonder, and a sense of discovery.
highway | Knowledge: A traffic artery is a term used to describe a major road or highway that connects different areas and carries a large volume of traffic. Therefore, it is more likely to be clogged due to the high number of vehicles using it. Major cities may have many traffic arteries, but not every road in a major city is a traffic artery. Towns usually do not have traffic arteries as they lack the volume of traffic to warrant such a description. Traffic lights may cause traffic congestion, but they are not traffic arteries themselves.
automobile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is facing a long winter commute and that the heater in some vehicle has stopped working. An automobile is a common mode of transportation for commuting, and it is likely that this is the vehicle that the writer is referring to. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
throw up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sick person may experience side effects if they do not receive treatment. "Throw up" is a common side effect of many illnesses and may be a sign of an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. "Get better" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as the sentence implies that the person is not getting better without treatment. "Train" and "battle cancer" are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and "take medicine" is the opposite of what is being suggested in the sentence- that the person is not receiving any treatment.
misshapen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary has an injury that affects her appearance, and she believes that this injury makes her less beautiful. The word "misshapen" means that her injury has caused her body to be deformed or distorted in some way, which would explain why she believes she is not beautiful. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
impatience | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child is waiting for something, which often leads to impatience. Wisdom, tiredness, and boredom are unlikely attitudes for a child waiting for something specific. Anxiety could be a possible answer, but it would depend on the situation and the child's personal disposition. However, impatience is commonly associated with waiting, especially among children who may lack the emotional maturity to handle delayed gratification.
feel full | Knowledge: After eating a meal, especially lunch, it is common to feel full due to the amount of food consumed. This is because the stomach expands to accommodate the food, and the brain receives signals that it's time to stop eating. The other options are not associated with the experience of eating lunch, and may not fit the context of the sentence.
business | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the committee had a lot of responsibility and they were part of a fast-growing entity. Doughnut shops, churches, and office buildings may have committees, but they are not typically associated with rapid growth. The term "business" is commonly used to refer to an organization or company, and it is often associated with growth and expansion. Additionally, government is typically not referred to as a "fast-growing" entity, so it is not a likely choice.
listen to online lessons or go to school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual needs instruction to find information. Two options in the choices involve instruction: listening to online lessons and going to school. The other options (learn, ask questions, death) do not directly address the need for instruction.
shaving kit | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the double edged razor is commonly used for shaving purposes, as it is typically found in a shaving kit. While it is possible to use a razor to cut tape, this is not a common use for a shaving razor. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lie | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the real estate agent is known for being honest, and the question is referring to a behavior that the agent refused to do to a client. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a term that is synonymous with dishonesty or deception. "Lie" is the best answer because it means providing false or misleading information, which is a clear contradiction to the agent's reputation for honesty. The other options also suggest dishonesty, but they are not as direct as "lie." "Charming" is not related to the context of the question.
empathy | Knowledge: The question is asking for what listening is a "big part" of, suggesting that it is a significant aspect. Empathy involves being able to understand and share the feelings of others, often through active listening. Therefore, it is likely that listening is a big part of developing empathy. The other options may involve listening to some extent, but they are not the central aspect.
small apartment | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason they only had a small dog is because their living conditions limited their ability to have a larger pet, such as in a small apartment where there may not be enough space for a bigger animal. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they imply more space or different types of living arrangements that are not mentioned in the sentence.
ski | Knowledge: The sentence mentions winter and traveling up a mountain, which suggests that the person has a sport or activity that he enjoys during the winter season. Among the choices, skiing is the most common winter sport that is often done on a mountain. Playing volleyball, hockey, knitting, or skating do not require traveling up a mountain during winter.
coming home | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "when their engagement has ended" implies that the soldiers in question were engaged in some sort of military conflict. The choices "use weapons" and "follow orders" are both common activities for soldiers during a conflict, but do not necessarily relate to the end of their engagement. "Die in battle" is a grim option but does not address what happens when the soldiers' engagement has ended. "Hope" is too vague to be a correct answer. "Coming home" is the most logical choice as it suggests that the soldiers will be returning home once their engagement has ended.
harmony | Knowledge: The word "agreeing" suggests a sense of unity and agreement between people. "Harmony" refers to a pleasing combination of different elements or people that work well together, indicating a sense of agreement and unity between them. "Band together" suggests a sense of uniting for a common purpose, "smiles" suggest a positive emotion but not necessarily agreement, "rapport" refers to a sense of understanding and connection, and "belonging" refers to feeling accepted within a group.
learn new or find truth (both are correct) | Knowledge: The word "ignorance" implies a lack of knowledge or understanding about a particular subject. Therefore, the best course of action for someone suffering from ignorance would be to learn new information or seek out the truth about the subject. "Judge" and "judgement" do not make sense in this context, and "learn about subject" is redundant as it is already implied by "learn new" or "find truth."
la ville | Knowledge: The phrase "outside of a central Wisconsin town" suggests that the advertisement was physically placed somewhere near the town. "La ville" means "the town" in French, so this is likely the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
potato | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has many eyes but cannot see, and that it has skin that can be peeled off. Only potatoes have "eyes" in the sense of small indentations on their surface from which new shoots can grow. Potatoes also have skin that can be peeled off, unlike faces or people's heads, which have flesh and bone structure, or lizards and mammals, which have scales or fur.
jewelry store | Knowledge: Wearable gold is typically sold in jewelry stores. Jewelry stores specialize in selling all types of jewelry, including pieces made of precious metals like gold. The other options do not make sense, as gold would not typically be sold in a church, treasure chest, zoo, or Fort Knox (which is a United States Bullion Depository).
work | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the question is asking about a common responsibility that many adults have. Out of the options given, work is the most likely answer as it is a necessary responsibility for many adults to maintain financial stability and support themselves or their families. The other options do not have the same level of universal applicability or necessity.
indicating identity | Knowledge: The context suggests that the title being referred to is related to one's personal identity or information. A safe deposit box may have a label stating the owner's information, but it would not take up a large percentage of the space. A magazine article may have a headline, but it would not cover the entire magazine. Indicating accomplishment may refer to a trophy or plaque, but again it would not take up a large percentage of the space. A library would have many books with titles, but individually they would not cover a large percentage of the space. Therefore, indicating identity is the most appropriate answer.
shelf | Knowledge: Board games are often stored on shelves or in cupboards as they are typically flat and can be easily stacked or stored in a compact manner. "Home" and "house" are too general and do not suggest a specific location within the home, while "basement" is too specific and not everyone has one.
study | Knowledge: The question is asking for a method to learn new material for a test. "Study" is the most relevant choice because it specifically refers to reviewing material in order to learn and remember it. The other choices, such as watching television or having fun, do not necessarily contribute to the process of learning new material. Going to school can be helpful, but it is not specific enough to be the best answer. Finally, while asking questions can be a useful study technique, it is not always applicable or necessary depending on the subject matter.
standing still | Knowledge: The key phrase in the sentence is "Mary was in motion the whole time," which suggests that everyone else was not moving as much as Mary. The word "standing" also implies a lack of movement, so "standing still" is the most appropriate choice. The other options ("stopped," "stillness," "static," "being still") are either redundant or do not convey the sense of relative movement that is implied in the sentence.
rural area | Knowledge: The fact that the fox was caught by animal control implies that it was removed from an urban or suburban area, where it may have been causing problems or could be in danger. The options "english hunt," "burrow," and "woods" all suggest confined spaces where the fox would not have been released, while "mountains" may not be a suitable habitat for the animal. "Rural area" is a more general and appropriate option that could be suitable for the release of a wild animal into its natural environment.
lot of | Knowledge: The question is asking about the amount of water, and suggests that there is currently only a small amount of water present. The phrase "not a little amount" implies that there is actually a significant amount of water, so the correct answer would be an option that indicates a large quantity. "Big" and "large" both suggest a substantial size or amount, but "lot of" specifically refers to a large quantity of something, making it the most appropriate choice. "Bog" and "rain" do not necessarily indicate a large amount of water, so they can be eliminated as options.
gas station | Knowledge: "Petrol" is a term commonly used in British English to refer to gasoline or fuel for vehicles. In this context, the most likely place to get petrol would be a gas station, as that is where vehicles typically go to refuel. The other options, such as "burn hot" and "fuel tank," are not locations where petrol can be obtained. "Car" is also not a suitable option as it is a vehicle that requires petrol to run, not a place to obtain it.
south carolina | Knowledge: The question specifies that the person is standing in a coastal, eastern seaboard state. Based on the choices provided, South Carolina is the only state that fits this description. Mountains, Arkansas, Louisiana, and California are not located on the eastern seaboard.
working out | Knowledge: The phrase "going for a run" typically refers to engaging in aerobic exercise, which is commonly referred to as "working out." The other options are not related to this context - a trip suggests traveling, running in could have multiple meanings and falling down implies an accident or injury.
picture | Knowledge: The question implies that the answer can be found in the context of one's own home, which rules out options like park or Switzerland which are physical locations. The word "see" suggests that the answer may have to do with visual perception, and "mountain" is a physical object. Therefore, the option "picture" is the most likely answer, as one can see a mountain in a picture or photograph displayed in their home. The other options again do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
running | Knowledge: The question asks about a sport that involves hurdles, indicating that it requires someone to run and jump over obstacles. The option "running" fits this description, as hurdle racing involves running and jumping over hurdles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, and therefore can be ruled out as incorrect answers.
ineffectual | Knowledge: The word "clever" suggests that the answer is not straightforward or obvious. "Clumsy" implies physical awkwardness rather than lack of skill, "dull" implies boring rather than bad, "stupid" and "dummy" imply a lack of intelligence rather than lack of skill. "Ineffectual," on the other hand, suggests that someone is not getting the job done or achieving their goals, which could imply a lack of skill.
deep breathing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe learned some exercises to help him relax from his therapist, and that these exercises all had a common focus. The phrase "centered around" implies that there was a central theme or action that the exercises all revolved around. Out of the five choices, deep breathing is most closely related to relaxation and is often promoted as a relaxation technique. The other options do not have a strong connection to relaxation or the context of the sentence.
receive gifts  | Knowledge: Birthdays are commonly associated with gift-giving. This is a time-honored tradition that has been practiced for many centuries, and is still popular today. The other options do not reflect the typical activities associated with birthdays.
surprised | Knowledge: The word "unexpected" suggests that the person will experience a feeling of surprise when confronted with something they did not anticipate. The other options may not be necessarily related to the context of being confronted with something unexpected. Anxiety may be a possible response, but not all people react this way. Dedication, solutions, and acknowledgment do not necessarily apply to the situation of being confronted with something unexpected.
toxic  | Knowledge: The word "lead" suggests that the question is referring to the chemical element. Lead is known to be toxic and harmful to human health when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Too much exposure to lead can cause a range of health problems, including brain damage, nervous system disorders, and anemia. The other options, such as "very heavy" or "very dense" describe physical properties of lead, but do not address its effects on human health.
expected | Knowledge: The sentence states that James was in shock upon learning something, and the word "not" in the question indicates that it was the opposite of what he expected. Therefore, the correct answer is "expected." The other answer choices do not provide any context clues or logical connections to the sentence.
speak spanish | Knowledge: The question is asking for advice on what to practice when going to Spain. Since Spain is a Spanish-speaking country, it makes sense to prioritize practicing speaking the language. The other options (stand upright, courtesy, further education, cross street) could also be important to keep in mind when traveling, but are not as crucial to being able to communicate and navigate effectively.
shake hands | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person met the speaker in the lobby of the office and that they didn't have much in common, suggesting that they may not have engaged in an extended conversation or activity. Therefore, the most common interaction between two people who have just met is to shake hands. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
street corner | Knowledge: The sentence provides information about the location of the church, which is near a store. It suggests that the church is likely to be located in a commercial area, such as a street corner, where there are other businesses and stores nearby. The other options do not fit with the description of a church that is located near a store.
None of the above, harming another person is not acceptable behavior.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sleeping well has a positive effect on the body and mind. One of the primary benefits of sleeping well is relaxation, as the body is able to rest and rejuvenate during the sleep cycle. Sweating and nightmares are not necessarily indicative of good sleep, and while dreaming can occur during sleep, it is not the primary result of sleeping well. "Have fun" is also an unlikely outcome of a good night's sleep.
student | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person mentioned is required to attend school, which is a common characteristic of someone who is a student. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Register" might be a possible answer if the sentence had mentioned the teen needing to register for classes, but that is not the case here. "Old enough" and "put on shoes" are also not relevant to the sentence. "Grouchy" is a possible descriptor of the teen's mood, but it does not answer the question of what the teen is.
accomplishment | Knowledge: People often compete in sports in order to achieve a sense of accomplishment, whether it be personal or within a team. Winning can bring a sense of pride and satisfaction, and the feeling of achieving something difficult can be motivating. Injuries are a risk associated with sports, but they are not usually a reason people choose to compete. Enemies and rivalry may be present in some sports, but they are not the primary motivation for most athletes. Death is not a motivation for sports, as it is not an expected outcome of competition.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys creating art more than having sex, which implies that creating art gives her a feeling of pleasure. Painting can be a form of self-expression and a way to escape from the stresses of everyday life, which may explain why Sally finds it so enjoyable. The other options do not align with the positive connotation of the sentence.
injury | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a potential danger associated with cleaning on the 10th floor of an unfinished building. It is important to take precautions and be aware of potential hazards when working at heights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
shoe | Knowledge: Since the question mentions that the foot is already covered in cloth, it suggests that the person is wearing some kind of footwear. Out of the options provided, only "shoe" is a type of footwear. It is common to put a cloth-covered foot into a shoe rather than on the ground, desk or table. "Sock" is also a type of footwear, but it is worn underneath a shoe, so it is not the correct answer.
getting tired | Knowledge: The statement suggests that the person being described is a successful marathon runner, which requires a great deal of physical endurance and stamina. Therefore, after running for such a long distance, it's natural to assume that the person might experience some physical discomfort. However, the use of the phrase "wasn't even beginning to" implies that the person is still feeling relatively good, and not yet facing any major physical symptoms. The other options, such as vomiting, excruciating pain, or death, all suggest much more severe consequences of running a marathon and are less likely to be seen as a natural part of the process.
drugstore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a contraceptive device called a diaphragm, which can be purchased from a drugstore. A diaphragm is a type of birth control that is inserted into the vagina, so none of the other options make sense in this context. A valve is a mechanical device used to regulate the flow of fluids or gases, while a human organ and a person's chest are not relevant to the conversation.
promotions | Knowledge: The question asks for a reason to keep going to work, which implies a positive outcome or motivation. "Promotions" is the most logical choice, as it suggests that there is potential for career advancement and increased job responsibilities. "Stress," "bad mood," and "exhaustion" are all negative factors that could make someone want to quit their job, while "for a party" is an irrelevant and nonsensical option.
wedding | Knowledge: Bar service is typically a key feature of weddings, where guests often gather to toast the newlyweds and enjoy a celebratory atmosphere. Entertainment venues such as nightclubs and concert halls may also offer bar service, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Hotel bars and train bars may be important amenities for travelers, but this is not necessarily related to celebrations. Pool parties often involve alcohol and socializing, but they are generally more casual and less formal than weddings.
dull | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah had a characteristic that hindered her socialization, which is commonly associated with being dull or uninteresting. The other options don't have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fridge | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where food can be kept cold, which suggests that the correct answer will be a type of storage container or area that is designed to keep food at a lower temperature. The options "cupboard," "oven," "glass," and "table" do not fit this description, but the option "fridge" does. A fridge (short for refrigerator) is a common household appliance that is designed to keep food at a low temperature to slow down the growth of bacteria and keep food fresh longer.
ground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the penny is not in a contained space, such as a piggy bank or coin purse, but rather in an open or unsecured location. Additionally, the phrase "beside your shoe" implies that the penny is located on the ground. Therefore, the correct answer is ground. The other options are containers or surfaces where one would typically store or place money.
warm room | Knowledge: Lighting a fire is commonly done to generate heat and warmth, particularly in colder environments. This can help to make a room more comfortable and pleasant to be in, especially during the winter. The other choices do not necessarily have a clear link to the idea of intentionally lighting a fire. For example, burning down a house would be an act of arson rather than a practical reason for lighting a fire. Helping people or cleansing could potentially involve fire in some cultural or symbolic contexts, but these are less common or specific reasons than warming a room.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence provides context clues that suggest that Simon placed drawings on a wall in a setting related to education. The term "crayon pictures" implies that these were drawn by a child, which would make a school or classroom a likely location. The other options are not connected to education in any obvious way and do not fit the context of the sentence.
virtuous | Knowledge: The question asks for a word that a bad person is unlikely to be called. "Virtuous" is a word that describes someone who has high moral standards and behaves in an honorable way, which is the opposite of what a "bad" person would be expected to do. The other words do not necessarily describe behavior or character traits and are not antonyms of "bad."
None of the choices are correct as the sentence does not provide enough information about what the person should have done instead. There could be various reasons why the person had torn pants, and it is not appropriate to judge them based on that.
wall | Knowledge: A window is a type of opening in a wall that allows light and air into a building. It is commonly found in houses and buildings, particularly on walls that face outside. The other options such as front door, space shuttle, office, and car are not typically associated with windows in the same way as walls in a house.
competitiveness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing games can sometimes become more serious, which implies that there is a competition or challenge involved. Competitiveness is a common reason why games become more serious, as players may be vying for a prize or simply trying to outdo each other. The other options do not explain why games would take on a serious tone.
get fat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman chose to watch TV instead of going to the gym for physical exercise. This puts her at risk of gaining weight or becoming less fit, which is why "get fat" is the correct answer. The other options may be indirectly related to the situation, but they don't address the immediate risk the woman is facing.
purchasing | Knowledge: The question is asking for the primary reason for visiting a shop, which would likely be to purchase something. While spending money may be necessary to make a purchase, it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop. Spending too much is not a reason for visiting a shop, but rather a potential consequence. Selling items is the purpose of the shop, not the reason for visiting it. Comparing prices may be a step in the purchasing process, but it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop.
living room | Knowledge: Wooden chairs are commonly used in living rooms as they add a touch of warmth and elegance to the décor of the space. In contrast, office spaces tend to have more modern furniture, desks are usually used with office chairs or task chairs, and cubicles are typically furnished with basic chairs with minimal styling. While a wooden chair may work well in a home office or even a covered outdoor space like a porch, it is not typically a go-to choice for a work environment.
good will | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that businesses that provide assistance to those in need are doing so in a positive and charitable manner. "Good will" refers to the beneficial or favorable attitude or relationship between individuals, businesses, or groups, and is often associated with acts of kindness or generosity. The other options, such as fear and dependence, have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence.
making new friends | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that meeting people with similar attitudes can lead to a positive outcome. People with similar attitudes often share common interests and values, which can lead to a natural connection and potential for friendship. Anxiety and being bored are negative outcomes that do not fit with the context of the sentence. Love and a new job are possibilities, but are not as directly related to meeting people with similar attitudes as making new friends.
watch television | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children engage in a particular activity at home that can be described as addictive. Out of the given choices, watching television is often associated with addictive behavior due to its immersive nature and the availability of countless programs and channels to choose from. The other options, such as drawing or playing chess, are not typically associated with addictions, while playing basketball or listening to music are more active and may not have the same addictive qualities as watching television.
music store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the item being purchased is a musical instrument, specifically a mandolin. It also mentions a storage box, which is a common accessory for musical instruments. Therefore, the most logical choice is a music store, which specializes in selling musical instruments and accessories. The other choices, such as Spain or a grocery store, do not have any clear connection to the context or purpose of the purchase. The option "Instrument case" could be a possible choice, but it does not mention anything about the purchase of the mandolin itself.
persuade | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bailey was skilled in his job as a real estate agent, which likely involved convincing people to buy or sell properties. Persuasion is a key component of salesmanship, and a good real estate agent would be adept at making convincing arguments and presenting information in a compelling way. The other options, like deceive and manipulate, carry negative connotations and would not be desirable traits in a successful real estate agent.
green | Knowledge: The phrase "green with envy" is a common saying that indicates extreme jealousy, often used to describe someone who covets something they cannot have. The use of the phrase "green with envy" suggests that his eyes appeared green because of the intensity of his jealousy. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the common expression.
domestic | Knowledge: The word "foreign" suggests that the flight in question is leaving the country. Domestic flights are flights that only operate within the borders of a particular country, so they cannot take you outside that country. All the other options (imaginary flight, American, native, and indigenous) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
community | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a school is a necessary part of a community. This is because schools provide education and learning opportunities for children and young people who live in that community. The other options may have schools, but the sentence doesn't imply that having a school is necessary for those places to function as they do. For example, playgrounds are important for communities, but not essential for their existence.
nebraska  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a state north of Kansas where cows outnumber people 4 to 1. The option "nebraska" is the only state that is directly mentioned as being north of Kansas. The other options ("advertisement," "countryside," "fairy tale," and "iowa") do not provide any useful information for determining the correct answer.
hardship | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the organization is providing support or aid to families who are experiencing some kind of difficulty or challenge, which is commonly referred to as hardship. The other options - risk taking, doom, helping others, and helpfulness - do not relate to the concept of families needing assistance or support.
being heard | Knowledge: The question suggests that the context is about communication, and the use of "talking to" implies that the goal is to convey a message to someone or something. In order for the message to be effective, the speaker would likely hope that they are being heard by the listener. The other options do not relate to effective communication or conveying a message.
no spouse | Knowledge: The sentence refers to the aftermath of getting a divorce, which typically results in the dissolution of the marriage and the end of the relationship between the spouses. Therefore, the correct answer is "no spouse." The other options, such as "lot of grief" or "children suffer," may be common experiences associated with divorce, but they do not address the specific question of what happens to someone after the divorce is finalized. "Freedom" may be a possible choice, but it lacks the specificity and certainty of "no spouse." "Party time" is unlikely to be a correct answer as it is not a natural consequence of divorce, but rather a personal choice.
lazy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercise is not a common habit for some people, specifically those who are described as "just plain" something. The word "lazy" is commonly used to describe people who don't like to put effort into physical activities, including exercise. The other options, such as "sloth" and "couch potato," are also associated with a lack of physical activity, but they are not as commonly used in everyday language as "lazy." "Condition heart" and "work out" are both related to exercise, but they do not fit the context of the sentence, which is discussing people who do not like to exercise.
army | Knowledge: The phrase "very strong leader" is often associated with contexts that require strict discipline and command, such as military or army contexts. A strong leader is needed to maintain order and control in high-pressure environments, and the other options do not have any clear connection to this type of leadership.
smoke cigarettes | Knowledge: The question is asking for a habit that can cause lung cancer, which is well known to be a serious health risk associated with smoking cigarettes. The other answer choices are unrelated to lung cancer and are not typically associated with harmful health effects.
of service to | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person volunteered to help after a disaster, suggesting that they wanted to provide assistance to those affected. The phrase "able-bodied" further supports this idea, as it implies that the person was physically capable of providing help. The option "of service to" best captures this intention, while the other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Critiqued" and "ask questions" imply a different motive than providing help, while "make happy" does not address the issue of disaster relief, and "have compassion for" suggests a more passive response.
get fired | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the salesman's job performance is being evaluated and that there are consequences for not doing the job correctly. The most severe consequence mentioned in the choices is getting fired, which is a common consequence for poor job performance. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence or are not consequences of poor job performance.
caribbean | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the storm is relevant to a specific location, which is likely where John was planning to go. The options "tropical seas" and "tropics" are too general and could refer to many places, while "Cuba" is a specific country and may not necessarily be where John was headed. "Caribbean" is a region that is often associated with tropical storms and would be a logical location for John to delay his trip to given the meteorologist's warning. "Weather report" is not a location and does not relate directly to John's travel plans.
pleasure | Knowledge: The option "pleasure" is the most likely correct answer because smoking is often associated with feelings of relaxation and enjoyment due to the nicotine content in cigarettes. The other options, such as "death" and "lung disease," are negative consequences of smoking and are generally not reasons why someone would continue to smoke. Additionally, the option "smell" might be a personal preference for some people, but it is not a common reason for smoking.
socialize | Knowledge: The word "interesting" suggests that the question is about meeting new people who are engaging or fascinating in some way. One common way to do this is by socializing, which typically involves attending events, joining clubs/groups or engaging in conversations with people. Online dating might also help meet people, but the focus is usually more on finding a romantic partner rather than just making connections. Exploring or saying hello to people can also lead to meeting new people, but it is less likely to result in long-lasting social connections. Being friendly is important, but it's not an action that leads directly to meeting people.
manual | Knowledge: The word "manual" suggests a book or reference guide that provides information on various subjects. This may be the best option for Sam if he is looking for detailed and comprehensive information on obscure subjects. "Online" and "Google" may provide some information but may not be reliable or accurate sources. "Newspaper" is unlikely to have information on obscure subjects, and "outside" is not a logical option for finding information.
cloudy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although clear blue skies are nice, there isn't much to see up there if it isn't a little something else. This implies that a little bit of clouds in the sky would make the view more interesting. Therefore, the correct answer is "cloudy." The other options are all negative descriptors and do not fit with the positive tone of the sentence.
salad dressing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy liked something that could be added to a meal, but he chose not to add it because he was watching his weight. The fact that he used a low fat version of it also implies that it is a food item that typically contains fat. Salad dressing is a common food item that is often high in fat, but can also be found in low fat versions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the place being referred to is a densely populated area with a large number of people living in it. This narrows down the options to "city" and "construction site," but the latter is not necessarily associated with a large number of people living in it. The mention of an excavation suggests that the place is a site where archaeological or construction work is being undertaken. Egypt is a specific country and the desert is not necessarily associated with a large population. Therefore, "city" is the best answer.
trashcan | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker is asking about the proper disposal of garbage, which is typically done in a trashcan or garbage bin. Toronto is a city and not relevant to the question, nor is floor, television, or in your neighbor's yard.
signed | Knowledge: A valid contract typically requires the signatures of all parties involved to indicate their agreement and acceptance of the terms. Revising and rejecting refer to the process of negotiating the terms and conditions of the contract before it is signed. Written in blood is not a legal requirement for a contract to be valid, and written on paper is another necessary component as it provides a written record of the agreement.
wait for | Knowledge: The sentence states that the couple were strict when it came to sex and were going to do something related to their wedding. The phrase "wait for" suggests that they were going to abstain from sex until their wedding night. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
train station | Knowledge: A train station is a place where people embark and disembark from trains at scheduled times. Knowing the time is essential for planning the arrival and departure times of trains, and a clock would be helpful for keeping track of these schedules. The other options, such as a desk or a school room, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence that involves tracking arrival times.
aggression | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that competing is a way for some people to release aggression. Competing often involves a sense of challenge and confrontation, which can be a healthy outlet for aggression when done in a safe and controlled way. The other options do not seem to fit as well with the context of the sentence.
companionable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who always hold a remote are not likely to possess a certain trait. The options "attached," "lovable," and "close" refer to emotional connections, and there is no clear connection to remotes. The option "likely" doesn't make sense grammatically. Therefore, the best answer is "companionable," which suggests that those who always hold a remote may not be easy to spend time with because they are focused on their electronic device rather than engaging with those around them.
pleasure | Knowledge: Kissing is often associated with physical pleasure, especially in the context of a romantic relationship. Hormones may also play a role in someone's desire to kiss, but the question is specifically asking about how they feel about it. Shyness and happiness are emotions that may be present in a new relationship, but they don't necessarily relate specifically to kissing. "Like" is too vague to determine whether it refers to the feeling of enjoyment or something else entirely.
national park | Knowledge: National parks are often known for their preserved natural sites, including forests. Forests can be found in many places, such as the countryside or the Amazon basin, but the question specifically mentions Billy wanting to see a forest, so the answer that directly relates to forests and their preservation is the national park option. The temperate zone does not provide enough context to know if a forest would be present in that area.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is unable to use his stove, so he needs to find an alternative location to cook. The most logical answer is the one that provides an alternative cooking location, which is a friend's house. The other options either don't have a kitchen or don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
feel cold | Knowledge: Ice is known for its ability to lower the temperature of anything it touches, which would cause the skin to feel cold. The other options do not make sense in this context - ice on skin would not cause excitement, itching, electric feelings, or pressure.
live lives | Knowledge: The sentence implies that animals are natural and unencumbered by self-consciousness, which means they behave authentically and without restraint. An animal's primary activity is its biological imperative to survive, which requires it to live a life in accordance with its instincts. The other choices, such as listening, biting, fighting, or smiling, do not accurately capture the essence of how animals behave in the wild.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The question states that the condition sets in after going to work with too little sleep. This suggests that the condition is related to being tired, which is a characteristic of exhaustion. Anger and bad mood may be related to exhaustion, but the question specifically mentions going to work, so poor judgement and boredom are less likely to be related to the context.
making love | Knowledge: The phrase "sex in a happy relationship" suggests an intimate and emotional connection between the individuals involved, which is often associated with the term "making love." The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional and relational aspects of sex in a happy relationship. "Nice act" and "wonderful thing" are vague and could refer to any positive experience, while "last hour" is unrelated to the topic and "feel good" is too general.
intoxication | Knowledge: Intoxication refers to the state of being drunk, which is a common side effect of consuming too much alcohol. Vomiting and nausea may occur as the body tries to rid itself of the excess alcohol, but defecation and frequent urination are not typically associated with excessive alcohol consumption.
natural habitat | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the bald eagle as a protected species, which suggests that something has threatened their survival. The word "dwindling" indicates that the thing that threatened the bald eagle's survival was decreasing in number or quantity. The phrase "natural habitat" refers to the environment where a species naturally lives and thrives, so it makes sense that protecting this would help preserve the bald eagle population. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence as well.
big cities | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many fast food restaurants located close to each other in order to handle a high volume of foot traffic. This is a common characteristic of densely-populated urban areas, like big cities, where there are many people moving around and in need of convenient food options. The other options, like farms or the center of town, do not fit this context as well.
windowless room | Knowledge: The sentence states that there is no source of light entering the structure. Houses and office buildings generally have windows or other openings to let in natural light, so they can be eliminated as options. A roof and a glass box are not likely to be structures that people spend time in, so they can also be eliminated. A windowless room is the most likely choice for a structure with no access to natural light.
atlantic ocean or pacific ocean | Knowledge: Jellyfish are aquatic animals that live in the ocean. The sentence suggests that a jellyfish might get cold in a certain location, so the answer should be an ocean where the water temperature could drop. The Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean are two of the world's largest oceans and have a wide range of water temperatures depending on location, so they are the most likely options. Salt water and hypermarket/store are not relevant options for where a jellyfish could get cold.
sunshine | Knowledge: Plants need sunlight to undergo photosynthesis, which is the process by which they produce energy to grow. Since an apple tree is a plant, it also requires sunlight to grow. The other answer options, such as apple juice and new hampshire, do not relate to the growth of an apple tree in any way. Bloom may refer to the flowering stage of the tree, but it is not the cause of its growth. Park may be a location where an apple tree is growing, but it does not explain what causes it to grow.
tide pool | Knowledge: Anemones are usually found in tide pools or shallow water near the coast. The sentence mentions that the anemone was being harvested for sale in New York, which is a coastal state. Therefore, it is likely that the anemone was taken from a nearby tide pool rather than from a nursery or Michigan. The other options, such as the ocean floor or Atlantic Ocean, are too general and not specific enough to pinpoint the source of the anemone.
hell | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the computer user was completely lost and struggling to understand what he was doing, which would likely make the instructional course a difficult and frustrating experience for him. The phrase "pure hell" is a common idiom used to describe a situation that is extremely unpleasant or difficult. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
wet clothes | Knowledge: The question implies that pouring water on oneself would result in something that is typically associated with water, such as becoming wet. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Thin blood and room temperature are unlikely to be affected by pouring water on oneself, while starting to melt and springing forth do not make sense in the context of human biology.
sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baby birds fell out of their nest, and the mom bird responded in some way. However, the options "grieve," "molt," "poop," and "puff" do not seem to fit the context. The only option that makes sense is "sky," which suggests that the mom bird flew away or soared overhead. This would likely be a natural response if the mom bird was unable to retrieve the fallen babies, or if she wanted to assess the situation from a safe distance.
high school | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions "Friday night," which is typically associated with high school football games. University and college campus may also have football fields, but they usually have games on Saturdays, not Fridays. City and excrete have no connection to the context of the sentence.
newspaper | Knowledge: The fact that the man recognized his picture in the crossword section suggests that he was looking at a publication. The other options, such as a table or biology book, do not make sense in this context. Additionally, newspapers commonly feature sections such as crosswords and have photographs of people.
movie | Knowledge: Tickets are commonly used to gain access to events or places, such as movies or sports games. The other options, such as a person's hand or a shoe, do not make sense in the context of the question.
kitchen | Knowledge: Sugar is commonly used in cooking and baking, which typically takes place in a kitchen. Cupboards and containers are common storage places for pantry items like sugar within a kitchen, while a bedroom or neighbor's house would be unlikely locations for storing sugar.
marker store | Knowledge: The context suggests that the word "highlight" refers to a type of marker. Therefore, the most likely option to obtain one would be a marker store. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
inspiration | Knowledge: The context suggests that the artist is not actively creating art, but is waiting for something to happen to spark their creativity. The word "dreaming" implies that the artist is imagining and contemplating rather than actively engaging in their work. The options "car accident" and "nightmares" are negative and have no clear connection to the context. "Wake up" is also unrelated as it suggests the artist needs to snap out of something, while the sentence describes a longer-term issue. "Hallucination" is not likely to be the answer as it suggests an altered state of reality rather than a burst of creativity. Only "inspiration" fits the context as it is a common trigger for artists to start working on a project.
higher interest rates | Knowledge: Inflation is an economic concept where the general price level of goods and services increases over time. One way governments can combat inflation is by raising interest rates, which makes borrowing money more expensive and encourages people to save their money instead of spending it. This decrease in demand for goods and services can help stabilize prices and reduce inflationary pressures. The other options, such as dissatisfaction or not doing much, do not have a direct relation to inflation. Saving money and investing may be good personal financial strategies, but they are not necessarily effective ways to combat inflation on a larger scale.
rush away | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the driver did not stop after hitting a post, which implies that the driver left the scene quickly. The phrase "rush away" best matches this description. The other options do not reflect the action of leaving the scene of an accident.
act | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the show was about human behavior, which would require acting. However, the sentence implies that none of them could act well, which adds an ironic twist to the situation. The other options, such as questioning authority or melting, do not seem to fit the context of putting on a show about human beings.
feelings of guilt | Knowledge: The question implies that killing people is not a normal behavior for most people, and therefore may have negative psychological effects. It is commonly accepted that killing someone will induce feelings of guilt and remorse, as taking another person's life is a serious act that goes against societal norms and moral values. The other options are consequences of committing murder, such as legal punishment, but do not address the psychological effects on a person.
fluidity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the substance being described changes from a solid to a liquid state. When a substance melts, it becomes fluid, which means it has the ability to flow and change shape. The other options do not fit the description of a substance that changes from a solid to a liquid state. Hollowness, openness, weakness, and instability are all related to a substance's strength or structural integrity, which is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
dictionary | Knowledge: The term "anemone" is not specific to any one subject or field of study. Therefore, looking up its definition in a dictionary would be the best choice. The other options do not provide the definition of what an anemone is. Oceanography may include information about anemones, but it would not specifically define the term. Tide pool and sea water may contain anemones, but they are not reliable sources for definitions. South Pacific is a region and is not relevant to the question.
crime scene | Knowledge: The presence of shattered glass, blood, and a gun suggests that a crime has been committed. As a detective, it is their duty to secure the crime scene and prevent tampering or contamination of evidence. Therefore, the correct answer would be to tape off the perimeter of the crime scene. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
harsh | Knowledge: The contrasting language in the sentence ("gentle" versus "different story") suggests that there is a difference in the treatment of the hand when washing with water versus when using chemicals. The adjectives "harsh" and "rough" both describe something that is tough and abrasive, which would make sense for how chemicals might feel on the skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is holding a lamp and is tired of doing so, indicating that they are likely looking for a surface on which to place it. The word "place" also implies that the speaker is talking about finding a stationary location for the lamp. Out of the given options, only "table" is a surface on which one might place a lamp, while the others do not make sense in the given context.
thin ice | Knowledge: Excessive heat is not related to apples, sterilization, killing bacteria, or blue metal. These options are irrelevant to the question. Thin ice, on the other hand, can cause a person to slip and fall, which could be exacerbated by high temperature causing dehydration or exhaustion. Therefore, thin ice is the most likely answer that relates to the context of the question.
sweating | Knowledge: Sweating is a natural way for the body to regulate temperature during exercise. As the body heats up, sweat glands activate and release sweat onto the skin's surface, which then evaporates and cools the body down. The other options, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and exhaustion, may also occur during exercise, but they are not directly related to the body's response to heat.
container | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baker received a new supply of sugar and stored it somewhere. A container is the most logical choice for storing sugar in a bakery as it helps to keep it fresh and prevent it from spilling. The other options, such as the neighbor's house or coffee, are unrelated to the context of the sentence. The kitchen and pancake mix are both relevant to baking but are not specifically related to the storage of sugar.
bad mood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a ferret's growling behavior is linked with a particular emotional state. Ferrets are known to growl when they feel threatened, scared, or angry, which are all associated with being in a bad mood. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hockey game | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a penalty box, which is a term commonly associated with hockey. Additionally, the referee calling a foul and a player being sent to the penalty box are both actions that are typical in a hockey game. The other options either do not have a penalty box or do not involve physical contact where a player can be called for a foul.
individual | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the A.I. has the ability to pick out separate entities within a larger group, implying that it can identify individual people within a densely packed crowd. The term "individual" specifically refers to a discrete unit that can be distinguished from others, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options describe a larger group or a less precise focus than what the sentence is suggesting.
Colorado | Knowledge: Mountain marmots are a species of ground squirrels that are found in the high-elevation rocky areas of Colorado, as well as nearby states in the western region of the United States. The other options may be too broad or not specific enough to be the correct answer in this context. For example, while mountain marmots do live in the wild, this is not a specific enough location to choose from the list of options.
frustration | Knowledge: Losing in a competition can be frustrating for many people, as it often means that they did not achieve the desired outcome or reach their goals. The question suggests that competing against someone likely to cause this feeling. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the question.
Italy | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Giovanni has a wine cellar like many of his compatriots, which suggests that he is from a country or region that has a tradition of wine making and storing. Italy is well-known for its wine making culture and it is likely that Giovanni is living in Italy if he has a wine cellar. The other options do not provide any context about wine making or storage.
costly | Knowledge: The sentence warns the reader to pay attention to the small print when something is offered for free, suggesting that there may be hidden costs or conditions associated with the offer. The word "costly" is a logical choice to describe the potential outcome if someone does not pay attention to the small print. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
michigan | Knowledge: The presence of a great lake suggests that the location is likely near one of the Great Lakes in North America. Michigan is a state known for bordering four of the Great Lakes, making it a likely answer. The other options do not provide any indication of being near a great lake, making them less likely answers.
theatre | Knowledge: Live entertainment typically refers to performances that are experienced in-person, such as music concerts, plays, and comedy shows. Movie theaters primarily show movies, while parks and friend's houses are not commonly associated with live entertainment. The option "show" may seem plausible, but it is too broad to accurately pinpoint a specific location to see live entertainment. Therefore, the correct answer is the theatre, as it is a well-known venue for live performances.
easy | Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of "hard," which suggests that the test is not difficult. The option that best fits this context is "easy." The other options (tricky, bearable, and tryhard) do not necessarily imply that the test is not hard, while "agreeable" is more commonly used to describe a pleasant personality rather than a test difficulty.
glove | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to keeping a finger warm. While a ring can keep a finger warm in some cases, it is not generally associated with warmth. Cake batter to taste add weight to scale and nose are not logical options. Hand is a possibility, but the specificity of the question ("where") suggests a more narrowly defined answer - a glove. A glove is an item designed specifically to keep hands (including fingers) warm, making it the most likely answer.
suburbs | Knowledge: A larger shopping mall is likely to be located in the suburbs because these areas typically have more land available for the construction of large commercial buildings such as shopping malls. Additionally, suburban areas tend to have higher population densities and more disposable income, which makes them attractive locations for businesses to set up shop. Downtown areas may have smaller shopping areas, but they are generally more focused on businesses such as offices, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Indiana and out of town do not provide any information about where a shopping mall is likely to be located.
backpack  | Knowledge: A student is likely to keep their notebook in their backpack, which is typically used to carry school supplies and books. The other options are less likely because a bookstore is a place where students buy books rather than keep them, a pocket may not be able to hold a notebook, an office is not typically associated with student possessions, and a classroom may be where the notebook is used but not where it is kept.
fresh egg | Knowledge: Fresh eggs are known to have a thick membrane surrounding the egg white and yolk, which helps to protect the contents of the egg inside. Cell membranes do exist, but they are not commonly referred to as "thick" membranes. Animal and filtration do not necessarily have thick membranes associated with them. Separating fluids may be accomplished through the use of a membrane, but this choice does not provide enough context for a definitive answer.
playground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lucy is likely to be found in a place where she regularly plays handball. Handball is typically played in an outdoor playground or indoor gymnasium setting, which makes options like field and street less likely. Bearing is not a location and does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is playground.
falling down | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that there is a potential danger involved in combining alcohol with movement on stairs. The phrase "falling down" suggests a loss of balance and a dangerous situation, which is the most likely outcome in this scenario. The other options, such as "lower standards" and "slurred speech," do not connect to the potential danger of using stairs while drunk. "Death" is a possibility, but it is an extreme and unlikely outcome compared to the more immediate danger of falling down.
drop | Knowledge: The word "slippery" suggests that the object is difficult to hold onto, and may slip out of one's grasp. Therefore, the most likely thing to happen is that the person would drop the object. The other options (make music, bluegrass music, folk, discovery) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rug | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the footprints are caused by dirt being left behind, which is a common occurrence on surfaces like rugs that are often walked on. The other options, like roofs and floorboards, do not typically accumulate dirt in the same way that rugs do. Ground and surface of earth could be options, but the phrasing of "footprints that happen due to dirt being left behind inside" suggests the footprints are on an indoor surface.
standing in line | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the answer should relate to a common experience when shopping in a busy store. The phrase "packed store" suggests that there are many people there, which often leads to long lines or waiting times to pay for items. Therefore, the correct answer is standing in line, which is a common activity when shopping in crowded stores. The other options, such as singing out loud, tiredness, debt, and spending money, do not make sense in the context of shopping in a busy store.
school | Knowledge: The question implies that the location has a desk drawer and people of vastly different ages nearby. A school is a logical answer because it is a place where desks are commonly used, and students of different ages attend. In a school, a desk drawer may contain supplies or personal items belonging to a student or teacher, and the age range of individuals in a school setting can vary greatly, from young children to adult teachers. The other options do not align with the context provided in the question.
desk | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the interior designer is looking for ways to improve the office's appearance, and one of the things she tried was adding a colorful rug under the computer. This suggests that the item being referred to is a piece of furniture that can accommodate a computer, which is most likely a desk. The other options, such as sofa or bedroom, do not fit the context of the sentence.
plan ahead | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a way to avoid problems when going somewhere, and the correct answer should be a step or action that can help achieve this. "Plan ahead" is the best option, as it implies taking time to organize and prepare for the journey, which can prevent potential issues such as getting lost or running into traffic. The other options may contain helpful information or actions, such as "know where to go," but they do not address the idea of avoiding problems specifically.
lightly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John ran very quickly or with great speed, as indicated by the phrase "ran very fast." The use of the word "feet" suggests that the question is asking about the manner in which John's feet touched the ground while he was running. The use of the word "lightly" suggests that John's feet did not hit the ground with much force, which is a common characteristic of fast, agile runners. The other options, such as "behind," "loose," "feverishly," and "slowly," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
overeating | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consequences of not choosing the right amount of food for breakfast will be discussed. The option "overeating" relates to consuming too much food, which can cause discomfort like indigestion, heartburn, and stomach ache. "Gain energy" does not affect directly from the amount of food consumed, but from the quality of food chosen.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John saw a billboard every day on his way to work, indicating that the billboard was located somewhere along his route. Since the choices are all geographic locations, we can eliminate Texas, Las Vegas, and the countryside, as these options do not have a clear connection to a street. Similarly, a football ground would not typically have billboards visible from the street. Therefore, the correct answer must be street.
meeting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is joining others at a table, which is commonly associated with a meeting or gathering. Meeting usually refers to a formal or informal gathering of people for a specific purpose, often with an agenda, and this could explain why John is joining others at the table. The other options like construction, kitchen, internet cafe, and building do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
work | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the goal is to gain more land, but there are few resources available. This suggests that simply buying land or property may not be feasible. Saving or earning money might be difficult if resources are already limited. Working could be a way to gain resources and potentially acquire more land in the future.
aid | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the support team is responding to a disaster, which implies that they are there to provide assistance or aid to people affected by the disaster. The other options do not fit the context. "Family" and "marriage" are not directly related to responding to a disaster, while "let down" and "neglect" have negative connotations that do not fit with the idea of a support team providing help.
array | Knowledge: The word "attributes" suggests that the question is referring to a list or set of characteristics or qualities. An "array" is a term commonly used to describe a systematic display of data or information, such as a table or matrix. On-screen is a possible display option, but it is not a universally applicable answer. The other options, calculus and calculas, are misspelled variations of the correct term. The term "description" is too vague and could refer to any number of ways to present information.
getting higher | Knowledge: Climbing a mountain involves ascending to a higher elevation, which is reflected in the choice "getting higher." Falling down and vertigo are not activities associated with mountain climbing, and elevation is a description of the change in height. Accomplishment could be a result of climbing a mountain, but it is not a description of the activity itself.
confession | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the politician is embarrassed and is expected to give a resignation speech. The press people are waiting for him, which indicates that there is likely a scandal or controversy surrounding the politician. The word "confession" fits with this context as it suggests that the politician may admit to wrongdoing or wrongdoing may be revealed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
amount to nothing | Knowledge: The phrase "a failure" suggests that the person is not successful or achieving their goals. "Insulted" and "hold back" do not convey the same meaning and are not synonymous with failure. "Illusion" means something that is not real or true, which is not related to the context of the question. "Lower expectations" may be a consequence of being a failure, but it is not synonymous. "Amount to nothing" means to have no success or impact, which accurately describes someone who is a failure.
spring into action | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the children will react excitedly when the candy is brought to them. "Spring into action" implies a sudden burst of movement or excitement, which is likely to be the response of children who are given candy. This option is the most fitting in the context of the sentence. The other choices do not make sense given the scenario described.
fridge | Knowledge: The most common place to store perishable items like beer is in a refrigerator or fridge. We know that the beer is being kept at home, so options like sporting event or bowling alley do not make sense. A bucket may be used for holding ice and keeping drinks cool, but it's not typically where someone would store beer long-term. A bar could be a place where beer is served, but the question is asking about where someone would keep their own beer at home.
burns | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the action of applying heat to combustible materials is being described. Combustible materials are those that are capable of catching fire and burning, so it is reasonable to expect that the correct answer would involve some kind of burning or combustion. The other options do not accurately describe the expected outcome of applying heat to combustible materials.
outhouse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a cultural difference in the perception of a specific type of bathroom in an apartment. The word "outhouse" refers to an external facility used for waste disposal, and would be considered odd to have in an apartment by some cultures. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not imply an external facility or cultural differences in bathroom design.
butcher | Knowledge: A double-edged razor is commonly used by butchers to make precise cuts in meat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
aristocrat | Knowledge: The middle ages were characterized by a feudal system where the aristocracy held a significant amount of power and influence. A villain in that time period may have been someone who used their position of power for nefarious purposes, making them an aristocrat. The other options do not fit the context of a villain in the middle ages.
submarine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is underwater exploration, specifically regarding a shipwreck. The use of the word "robotic" implies that machines have already been used to check out the shipwreck, which may indicate that a human is needed to provide additional information. A submarine is a vehicle specifically designed for underwater exploration and could potentially provide more information than any of the other options listed. The other options are not related to underwater exploration and have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
parents | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman gave something to a child after experiencing trouble for a prolonged period of time. Giving birth to a child would be a common interpretation of the sentence, as it is a significant event that would likely require a lot of effort and could be considered a "trouble". The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's main motive for going fishing was not to catch fish for survival or to fulfill any other serious purpose. Instead, the use of the phrase "going fishing" suggests a leisure activity that is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment. The other options like relaxation, talking to someone, boredom, or killing do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "having fun."
speak out | Knowledge: The phrase "communicate in public streets" suggests that the speaker is engaging in public speaking or addressing a crowd. The goal of such communication is usually to share a message or to persuade others to take a specific action, which is consistent with the choice "speak out." The other options, such as "death," "send email," "listen," and "think," do not make sense in the context of public speaking.
amusement park | Knowledge: Roller coasters are a popular attraction at amusement parks, which often require visitors to purchase tickets or passes to gain access to the rides. Train stations, venues, banks, and fairgrounds are not typically associated with roller coasters or ticket booths.
cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James put the tea away after he poured it into a container, which implies that he kept it in a storage space of some sort. The most likely option for this type of scenario would be a cupboard, as it is a common storage area for kitchen items such as tea. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they are either irrelevant (internet cafe) or do not make sense for storing tea (teapot, refrigerator).
shrinking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when a person loses weight, their body fat goes through a certain process. The word "shrinking" implies that the fat cells are decreasing in size or quantity, which is a common result of weight loss. The other options do not make sense in this context - weight loss and hunger are already mentioned in the sentence, death is not directly related to weight loss itself, and decomposition is not a process associated with losing weight.
museum | Knowledge: The use of the word "displayed" suggests that the cornet was part of a collection that was open to the public for viewing. While all options may have been a possible location for the cornet, a museum would make the most sense because it is a place specifically designed for displaying artifacts and works of art for public viewing. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
refrigerator | Knowledge: Groceries that you buy are typically perishable items that need to be stored in cool temperatures to keep them fresh. The most common place to store groceries at home is in the refrigerator. The other options, such as supermarket, pantry, shelf, and trunk, are not places where groceries would typically be stored at home.
universe | Knowledge: The sentence refers to space, planets, and moons, which are all part of the larger system that includes everything we can observe. This system is commonly known as the universe. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
grateful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is bitter because of his wheelchair-bound condition, which indicates a sense of frustration or dissatisfaction with his limitations. Out of the given choices, being grateful would be the most appropriate contrast to his bitterness. It implies that James should appreciate what he has rather than focusing on what he doesn't have. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
state park | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people are looking for a recreational activity to do in the summer. The options "confession," "meetings," and "supermarket" do not fit this idea. "Carnival" could be a possibility, but "state park" is a more general option that could offer a range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, fishing, or camping, making it the most appropriate choice.
boardroom | Knowledge: The word "committee" suggests a group of people who are working together on an ongoing basis, typically within a business or organization. The word "meeting" indicates that the group will be discussing something important, and the context suggests that they will be doing so in a professional setting. The options "church", "zoo", and "city hall" do not fit this description, and so can be eliminated. The option "office building" is more general than "boardroom", which specifically refers to a room in which a company's leadership would meet to make decisions and discuss important matters. Therefore, the most logical answer is "boardroom".
being full | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person has stopped having food, which means that they are no longer eating. The other options suggest reasons why someone may continue to have food, such as getting fat or being hungry, which do not fit the context of the sentence. Being full, on the other hand, is a common reason why someone may stop eating, as they may feel satisfied and no longer need to consume more food at that time.
valve | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the diaphragm was used to turn off the water, which indicates that it is a type of valve. A valve is a device that controls the flow of a fluid (usually a gas or liquid) in a pipeline or similar system. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
field | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to farming, and snakes are commonly found in fields where crops are grown. Farmers may be startled by snakes in the fields because they can damage crops or pose a threat to livestock. The other options - tropical forest, tree, pet shops, and book stores - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
human | Knowledge: A diaphragm is a muscle located at the bottom of the ribcage that aids in breathing by contracting and expanding the chest cavity. Humans, along with other mammals like dogs and cats, have a diaphragm. The other options are not relevant to the question or context of the sentence.
turn blue | Knowledge: When a person is choking, they are unable to breathe properly and may start to turn blue due to lack of oxygen. This is a known symptom of choking and would help a person choose the correct answer from the given choices. The other options do not have any clear connection to choking.
believe in god | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person is searching for more meaning in life, which commonly leads to religious beliefs. The option "believe in god" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence's context. Options such as "gain weight" and "own car" are irrelevant and have no connection to the sentence. "Thank God" and "experience joy" may be associated with religious beliefs but are not the most appropriate answers in this context, as the sentence does not suggest gratitude or pleasure.
very fragile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the glass window was delicate and easily broken. The word "transparent" also implies that the glass was clear and easy to see through. The word "thin" further reinforces the idea that the glass was not strong or sturdy. "Soft" and "half empty" do not make sense in the context of describing a glass window, and "recyclable" is not relevant to the situation.
offices | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that air conditioning is being discussed in relation to work spaces. While it may be common to have air conditioning in homes, cars, movie theatres, and even cold rooms, the specific focus on work spaces indicates that offices are the correct answer. Air conditioning is often used in office buildings to help regulate temperature and create a more comfortable environment for employees to work in.
strong feelings | Knowledge: The word "passionate" suggests intense emotions, and the act of kissing is often associated with romantic or sexual feelings. Therefore, the most likely result of passionate kissing would be strong feelings, which could include attraction, love, or desire. The other options are either unrelated or present negative outcomes, which do not fit with the positive tone of the question.
entertainment | Knowledge: Television is commonly used as a form of entertainment, whether it's watching a favorite show, movie, or sporting event. While it's possible to use television to check email or even fall asleep, the context of the answer suggests that the primary purpose is for enjoyment and leisure activities. The other options, getting tired and turning off, suggest a negative experience with television rather than a positive one.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence describes a personal space that is decorated with posters, suggesting that it is a place where someone can freely decorate to their liking. It is unlikely to be the White House or a museum, which are public spaces with specific decorum. A school or apartment may not allow for personal decorations in shared areas. Therefore, the most likely option is a friend's house where Suzie can decorate her personal space with posters of her favorite celebrities and interests.
his textbook | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James separated his subjects by placing a divider between arithmetic and English. This implies that James has separate textbooks for each subject, and that he can continue using his math textbook even after he finishes his arithmetic class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
person's head | Knowledge: The human eye is a feature commonly found on the face of a person, which is why "faces" and "person's head" are likely answers. "Potato" and "skull" do not have any connection to the context of the question and therefore can be eliminated as options. While "mammal" might be technically correct, it is too general and does not narrow down the answer enough.
body of water | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a specific location where Amelia tried to aim for a small isle, which suggests that the body of water in question must be significant enough to have an isle. While all the choices refer to bodies of water, only "body of water" is specific enough to describe the situation in the sentence. The other choices, such as "pool" or "auditorium," do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dave's efforts to listen to his wife and understand her better resulted in both of them finding something. The word "satisfaction" implies that they both felt a sense of fulfillment or contentment as a result of their improved communication and understanding. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence, as they do not necessarily imply a positive outcome from Dave's actions.
mean things | Knowledge: The sentence implies that bad words were being said in a place of worship, which is likely to be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful. The phrase "mean things" suggests that the bad words were offensive or insulting in nature. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not specifically refer to the use of offensive language.
front yard | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the lawn being referred to is located on a street, which would make the front yard the most probable option. This is because front yards are typically located directly in front of a house and face the street, whereas green yards or suburbia could refer to any type of lawn in any location. A golf course is typically not found on a residential street, and Michigan is a state and not a type of lawn.
give gifts | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common practice that occurs on a person's birthday. Giving gifts is a common tradition for birthdays, whereas the other options do not have a clear connection to birthdays. Receiving letters may occur on some birthdays, but it is not as common as giving gifts. Feeling embarrassed, going to the club, and thanking God may occur on some birthdays but are not universal practices.
poisonous gas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that during World War I, both sides used a method of causing death that has since been banned. This eliminates options such as nuclear weapons, which did not exist during World War I. Homicide is a general term for killing someone and doesn't specifically refer to the use of a weapon or method of causing death. Cyanide is a poisonous substance, but it was not used on a large scale during World War I as a weapon. "Massive weapons" is also a vague term and does not provide any specific information about what was used during the war. Thus, the correct answer is poisonous gas.
arctic tundra | Knowledge: White foxes, also known as arctic foxes, are commonly found in cold regions such as the arctic tundra. Their white fur helps them blend in with the snowy environment and stay camouflaged from predators. The other options, such as the great outdoors or mountains, are too broad and do not necessarily indicate a specific habitat where white foxes are commonly found.
cage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sloth is held in captivity in a zoo outside of a city. Zoos commonly have cages or enclosures to house animals, so it is likely that the sloth would be found in a cage. The other options (encyclopedia, dictionary, and wilderness) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. While a sloth might be found in the countryside, it would be unlikely to find one in a small zoo outside of a city.
new computer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person working in the office experienced a system crash, which would likely affect their ability to work on their computer. Therefore, they would need a new computer to continue their work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
part ways | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that life can take different paths for different people, and sometimes that means good friends need to separate or move in different directions. The phrase "part ways" often refers to the end of a friendship or relationship, indicating that this may be the correct answer. The other options (such as "comfort" or "eat cake") do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this context.
have food | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is in need of nourishment, so the most appropriate solution would be to have some food. The other options may not address the specific need for sustenance and may not effectively alleviate hunger. Eating quickly, for example, may cause discomfort and indigestion. Eating vegetables or making bread may not readily provide an immediate solution to the need for food.
multiplied | Knowledge: The key phrases in the question are "at most twice as large" and "positive integers." To get a result that is at most twice as large, you need to multiply the positive integer by a number that is at most 2. This is because any number greater than 2 would result in a product that is more than twice as large as the original number. Dividing or subtracting would result in a smaller number, while adding up numbers would result in a larger number. Writing down the number is not an operation that would change the value of the number.
distracting | Knowledge: The word "effect" implies that the TV had a negative impact on the kids, and the word "distracting" suggests that it prevented the kids from focusing on more productive activities. To "become adults" is a natural process that cannot be attributed to the TV, while "wonder about" and "open door" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Became healthy" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it is not related to the topic of the TV's impact on the kids.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy was doing his homework at the last minute and was struggling to think clearly, which suggests that he may have been tired or exhausted. Sneezing and allergies don't necessarily cause difficulty thinking, while cleanliness is not related to this context at all. Seizures are a possibility, but there is no direct indication in the sentence that Billy was experiencing one.
skyscraper | Knowledge: The context clues in the sentence suggest that the location being described is a very high point with an observation deck, indicating that it is likely a tall building such as a skyscraper. The other options like mall, book of stories, and apartment building do not fit the description of a high point with an observation deck.
sandy beach | Knowledge: The sentence mentions being pinched by a crab, which implies that the question is related to a beach or shoreline environment. The option "sandy beach" is the most likely correct answer because crabs are commonly found in coastal areas, and sandy beaches are a common type of beach environment where crabs may be present. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not specific enough.
painting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is trying to capture the beauty of the landscape, but he isn't good at it. This implies that James lacks skill in the specific area of capturing the beauty of landscapes. The phrase "he was never good at it" reinforces this idea. The other choices may be elements within the landscape, but they are not directly related to James' lack of skill in painting.
wet clothes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that clothes have been washed. After washing, clothes typically come out wet and need to be hung up or put in a dryer to dry. The other options are not likely outcomes of washing clothes. "Cold cloth" does not make sense in this context, "shrinkage" and "wear out" describe negative effects that may occur over time with repeated washing, and "get wet" is redundant as clothes already are wet after washing.
movie theater | Knowledge: Popcorn is a popular snack when going to see movies at a movie theater. It is not typically associated with the other options listed, such as a basketball game or carnival. While popcorn is sometimes available at live shows, it is not as commonly consumed in that context as it is in a movie theater setting.
jam | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the guns could have a malfunction if they are hit on the ground. The word "jam" specifically refers to a situation where the gun fails to fire properly due to a mechanical problem. The other options are either too general (e.g. "break") or too extreme (e.g. "shoot someone" or "take life") and do not accurately reflect what could happen if a gun is dropped or hit on the ground.
ground | Knowledge: Pavement is a hard surface material used to cover the ground in order to make it easier to walk, drive, or ride on. It is commonly found on roads, sidewalks, and other public spaces that are meant for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. While it may often be associated with urban areas such as towns and city blocks, it can also be found in rural areas for things like driveways and pathways. A race track may also have pavement, but it is not a common use for this material.
Pacific ocean | Knowledge: The sentence mentions an island off the coast of California, which suggests that it is located in the Pacific Ocean, since California is on the west coast of the United States and the Pacific Ocean is to the west of California. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they are either landforms or unrelated bodies of water.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person ate a lot, and the word "satisfyingly" suggests that they enjoyed it. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to a feeling of pleasure or contentment after eating. The options "stomach aches" and "full belly" suggest discomfort or overindulgence, which contradicts the idea of feeling satisfied. "Getting full" and "full stomach" are too vague and don't convey a sense of enjoyment or satisfaction. Therefore, "satisfaction" is the most appropriate choice for the context of the sentence.
experience joy | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a common emotion people feel when something good happens. Joy is a common positive emotion that people experience when they receive good news, accomplish a goal, or have a positive experience. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence and are not commonly associated with positive emotions.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "burnout from staying too long at home," indicating that the person is experiencing exhaustion or fatigue from being stuck inside for an extended period of time. The best way to combat burnout in this scenario would be to engage in relaxation activities, such as meditation, yoga, or taking a warm bath. "Elapsed time" does not provide a solution to the problem, "exit" is not relevant to the context, "uneasiness" is the opposite of what is desired, and "getting there" is not applicable to resolving burnout from staying at home.
book | Knowledge: A bound stack of papers that form a single continuous volume, often containing a text or multiple texts, is commonly referred to as a book. The other options have no clear connection to the description of a bound stack of papers. A classroom is a space in which students are taught, a cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, a notebook is a small book used for taking notes, and a suitcase is a container used for carrying clothes and belongings during travel.
give up | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that should not be done when trying to get in shape. Jogging, drinking water, period of recovery, and dieting are all positive actions that can contribute to getting in shape. "Give up" is the only option that suggests a negative action that would hinder progress towards fitness goals.
bus | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is checking belts, which is a common safety measure for buses. The context of the sentence also indicates that the students are getting ready to leave, which further supports the idea that they are on a bus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
carry freight | Knowledge: While airplanes can certainly catch on fire or stall, and can also fly in the clouds and accelerate, the primary purpose of airplanes is to transport people or cargo. In this case, the language choice "carry" implies something being transported, and "freight" specifically refers to cargo or goods being shipped.
hospital | Knowledge: Hospitals are known for being places where people go to get medical treatment for illnesses or injuries. Therefore, it makes sense that people trying to alleviate suffering would be found in hospitals. In contrast, a hockey game, apartment, kitchen, or water cooler do not have the same connotations of people attempting to alleviate suffering.
mouth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is one thing that is necessary for every human to play a harmonica, and the answer choice "mouth" is the only option that makes sense in the context of playing a musical instrument. The other options, such as "wings" and "pocket," are not relevant to playing a harmonica. "Music shop" and "blues band" may be helpful in obtaining a harmonica or playing with others, but they are not necessary for playing the instrument itself.
fun | Knowledge: Playing games on computers is primarily for entertainment purposes, and the enjoyment factor is a key aspect of gaming. While some video games may have educational value, the main motivation for most people to play games is the fun and excitement they provide. The other options listed don't fit the context of the question, and are not typically associated with playing games on computers.
will resent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has hurt someone else that the person loves. In this context, it is likely that the person will feel resentment towards the person who caused harm to their loved one. Resentment is a common emotional response to feeling wronged or violated, especially when it involves someone we care about. The other options do not reflect the emotional response that is likely in this scenario.
Chicago | Knowledge: The name of the baseball team, Cubs, is an abbreviation of its original name, the Chicago Cubs. Therefore, the stadium where the Cubs play their home games is located in Chicago. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, except for maybe urban areas, which is too broad and general.
make lists | Knowledge: The question asks for an activity that can help people organize when they have a lot to do. Making lists is a commonly recommended strategy for organization, as it allows people to visually and mentally prioritize their tasks and keep track of what needs to be done. The other options are not directly related to organization or may not be effective strategies for it.
pizza place | Knowledge: The description of the food being "round bread covered with cheese and pepperoni" is commonly associated with pizza. Pizza places are known for baking and serving different types of pizza, which can be customized to the customer's liking. None of the other options - restaurant, prison, refrigerator, and own home - have any clear connection to serving pizzas.
street | Knowledge: The question is asking about where people would typically use umbrellas when it is raining. The most common place for people to use umbrellas during rain is when they are walking on a street, as it allows them to stay dry while commuting or running errands. The other options (forest, under the water, Disneyland) do not make logical sense in the context of the question, and weather is too broad of an answer to accurately choose.
depression | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the situation described involves a loss or separation, and the context of ending a marriage implies a significant emotional event. If the person is still in love but the relationship isn't working out, they are likely to feel sad or depressed about the end of the marriage, even if they may also feel relief from the struggles they were facing. The other options do not make sense in this context.
wonderful memories | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person and their friends had a "wonderful" weekend trip, indicating that they likely enjoyed their time together and created positive experiences. Memories are lasting and can be cherished for a lifetime, making them a logical answer choice. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as the sentence does not suggest that the group gained any new knowledge, property, or offspring. Friendship bracelets, while a nice gesture, do not necessarily last a lifetime.
checkers | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that winning is a possible outcome of playing a certain type of game. The choices "having fun," "entertain," and "injury" do not suggest a specific game that can result in winning. "Competition" is a possibility, but it is too broad to choose a specific game that could result in winning. However, "checkers" is a specific game that involves competition and can result in winning.
carry freight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Tim flies airplanes that are not used for carrying passengers, which leaves only a few possible options. Arriving late, catching on fire, and teaching do not seem relevant to the context. Taxiing might be an option, but the sentence emphasizes that Tim doesn't have to worry about passengers, which suggests he is not transporting people. Therefore, carrying freight is the most likely choice. Freight planes are commonly used to transport cargo, and do not have the same concerns as commercial passenger planes.
wait turn | Knowledge: The phrase "getting in line" suggests that people are queuing up for something, and the options "follow others," "late," and "have to wait for" do not necessarily explain why someone would be in line. "Wait turn" is the most straightforward answer, as people often wait in line to take turns for something like a ride, attraction, or to order at a busy restaurant. "Longer lines" could also be a possible answer, but it is less specific than "wait turn."
obtaining information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is only listening and not speaking, which implies that they are not actively participating in a conversation or exchanging ideas. The other options may be relevant in other contexts, but here the focus is on receiving or gathering information from the speaker. Therefore, the correct answer is "obtaining information."
wait for | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is questioning the sincerity of the woman's love for him, and implies that if her love were true, she would wait for him. This suggests that the speaker is leaving and may be gone for some time, which would require the woman to wait for him if she truly loves him. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
finger | Knowledge: The question is asking about the proper placement of a wedding ring before proposing, suggesting that the ring should already be on a specific location before the proposal takes place. The most logical option is "finger" as that's where the ring is traditionally worn after a proposal. The other options don't make sense in this context.
dimly lit room | Knowledge: The phrase "in case of emergency" suggests that the candle is being kept for use during a power outage or other type of unexpected situation. Keeping a candle in a dimly lit room makes the most sense in this context, as it would provide light where there otherwise would not be any. The other options are not relevant to the idea of an emergency situation.
countryside | Knowledge: The word "native" suggests that the answer is referring to the natural or original habitat of mice. While mice can live in a variety of places, their natural habitat is typically in fields or wooded areas, which are typically found in the countryside. The other options, such as attic or laboratory, are not a mouse's native habitat but rather places where they may end up due to human activity.
get better | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the sick person is no longer sick, which is typically associated with getting better. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not correspond with the idea of recovering from an illness. "Throw up" and "scuba dive in the bath" are unrelated actions, while "battle cancer" implies a more serious and ongoing illness, and "take medicine" refers to a treatment that may help the sick person get better, but not necessarily guarantee their recovery.
being comforted | Knowledge: The verb "praying" suggests that the context is related to religion or spirituality. The phrase "leading to the desired outcome" implies that the person who prayed wanted something specific to happen. "Being comforted" is a likely result of praying, as it is often seen as a form of seeking emotional support and reassurance from a higher power. The other options may also be associated with prayer or spirituality, but they are not as directly related to the desired outcome or the act of praying itself.
festival | Knowledge: The word "bazaar" typically refers to a marketplace or street market in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries. While bazaars can be found in other parts of the world as well, they are not as common in the US. Therefore, the most likely option for what someone would call a bazaar in the US is "festival", which can refer to a variety of events that involve food, music, and vendors selling goods. The other options refer to specific regions or cities and do not have a direct connection to the concept of a bazaar.
work | Knowledge: The sentence implies a connection between drinking coffee in the morning and gaining energy for a particular activity. The context of drinking coffee during a commute suggests that the activity in question is likely work, as many people drink coffee to help them stay alert and focused during work hours. The other options, such as playing sports or wrestling, do not align with the context of the sentence or the typical benefits of drinking coffee. Obesity and fatigue may be negative effects of a lack of energy, but they are not activities or goals that require extra energy.
college campus or country club | Knowledge: Municipal parks are a common location for recreational facilities like tennis courts, but they are not the only places where you can find them. College campuses and country clubs are also known for having tennis courts. High schools may have tennis courts, but they are less likely to be open to the public. Michigan and town are not relevant to the context of the question since they do not provide information about where tennis courts can be located.
intoxication | Knowledge: Beer contains alcohol which, when consumed in large quantities, can lead to intoxication. Intoxication can cause impaired judgment, loss of coordination, and other effects that would not be associated with self control or relaxation. While pleasure may be a side effect of drinking beer, it is not necessarily a result of buying too much beer specifically. Problems could also be a consequence of buying too much beer, but the question is specifically asking about what might happen after the purchase.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man did not consider the impact his suicide would have on others, specifically the pain it would cause them. This is a common consequence of suicide, as the loved ones left behind often experience intense grief and emotional pain. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of suicide or the emotions associated with it.
breathe | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the elephant's trunk is above the water while swimming, suggesting that it is using it to breathe. Elephants are known to use their trunk as a snorkel while swimming to breathe, as they cannot hold their breath for long periods of time. The options "experience sadness," "choke," "remember everything," and "forget nothing" do not relate to the context of the sentence.
room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the situation being described is related to a place where there are light bulbs that can fade into darkness. The options "theatre," "sunrise," "twilight," "basement," and "lamp" do not necessarily have clear connections to this context. "Room" is the most likely choice as it is a common place where light bulbs are found and can fade into darkness if the lights are turned off or if the bulb burns out.
jail time | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting someone is a crime and the person could face consequences for it. Jail time is a common punishment for committing a crime and is therefore the most likely option. Punishment is a more generic option that could apply to any type of consequence, but jail time is a specific consequence that is commonly associated with crimes. Bad karma and will resent are not legal consequences and are therefore unlikely options. A fight is also not a legal consequence and is not a appropriate response to a crime.
trunk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is about where to store groceries while driving home in a car. The only option that makes sense for this context is the trunk of a car. The other options, such as grocery cart and supermarket, are not relevant to the context. Pantry and shelf are not applicable choices as they are not part of a car.
farmer's market | Knowledge: Fresh produce, including potatoes, is commonly sold at farmer's markets, which are known for carrying locally grown and harvested fruits and vegetables. Deep sea and bushel basket have no connection to potatoes. While Ireland is known for potatoes, the answer is asking where one can buy a fresh potato, and not necessarily in Ireland specifically. A grocery bag may contain potatoes, but it does not specify if they are fresh or not, as grocery stores may sell both fresh and pre-packaged potatoes.
lay down  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the students were instructed to sit quietly, but the "trouble child" did not comply with this instruction, indicating that they did something else instead. Among the choices provided, "lay down" seems to be the most opposite of "sit down," and therefore the most likely option. "Listen" and "meditate" would fall under the category of listening and following instructions, which the "trouble child" did not do. "Alone" is not an action, and therefore does not fit the context of the sentence.
anxiety | Knowledge: The context of waiting for a response from an interview suggests that the individual is likely experiencing feelings of uncertainty, nervousness, and anticipation. These emotions are commonly associated with anxiety, which is a state of heightened mental and physical arousal in response to perceived threats or challenges. The other options, such as having fun or feeling tedious, do not fit the context of waiting for a response from an interview. Patience and impatience are related to waiting, but they do not accurately reflect the emotional state that typically accompanies waiting for an important outcome like a job interview.
montana | Knowledge: The sentence provides a specific location, Butte, which is a city in the state of Montana. "Countryside" might be a possible option, but it is too broad and generic of a term to accurately describe the location of the ranch house. "Neighborhood" and "subdivision" imply a more urban or suburban setting, while "desert" is not a likely location for a ranch house in Montana. Therefore, "montana" is the best answer.
camera | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a device with a lens that is used for taking photos. While a microscope and telescope also require optics (lens), they are not typically used for taking photos. A spoon is obviously not a device for taking photos. A camera, on the other hand, is specifically designed to take photos using a lens.
toy store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe got a toy for his child (a plush bald eagle), rather than a live animal. This rules out options like pet shop, great outdoors, and nature reserve. The fact that it is a plush toy implies that it was purchased from a store that sells toys, which would be a toy store. Canada is an unlikely option as it is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
new age | Knowledge: The definition of a birthday involves marking the anniversary of a person's birth, which means celebrating when they have reached a new age. "Funeral", "die", and "obesity" are all irrelevant and negative options, and "happy" is too broad and doesn't relate specifically to the context of a birthday celebration.
getting somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of traveling is straightforward and uncomplicated. The phrase "just" implies that the answer is something basic or easy. "Relocation" implies a permanent move, rather than just traveling. "Disorientation" implies confusion or unease, which contradicts the idea that traveling is simple. "Meeting new people" is not necessarily a requirement for traveling. "Statue" is not related to the context of the sentence. "Getting somewhere" is the most straightforward and simple answer that aligns with the context of the sentence.
trees | Knowledge: Leaves naturally belong on trees, as they are an important part of the tree's life cycle. Leaves collect sunlight to produce food through photosynthesis, and when they fall from the tree they provide nutrients to the soil. They can also provide shelter for animals and insects. The other options either don't make sense or would be harmful to the environment (e.g. leaving leaves in the street could block drains and cause flooding).
godless | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being described does not believe in a higher power or deity, and "godless" is a commonly used term to describe such individuals. "Humdrum" and "horrible" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, and "undivine" is not a commonly used term to describe a lack of belief in a divine being.
more manageable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when hair becomes too long and heavy, it becomes difficult to handle or style. Cutting it would make it easier to manage, meaning it would be more manageable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not mean easier to handle or style.
dream dreams | Knowledge: It is well-known that dreaming is a common occurrence during human sleep. While some individuals may remember their dreams more frequently than others, it is widely accepted that dreaming is a natural part of the sleep cycle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
bowl of soup | Knowledge: The context suggests that the spoon is being used for eating. Glass of iced tea or serving dish does not require a spoon to be used, kitchen drawer and dishwasher are not logical places to put a spoon before adding food to it, and dinner is not an object that a spoon can be put next to. Therefore, the correct answer must be bowl of soup, as it is the only option that requires the use of a spoon for eating.
go to heaven | Knowledge: The question is asking for a commonly held belief about what happens after death. While some people may believe in cessation of movement, breath, or life, the option "go to heaven" is a commonly held belief in many religions and cultures. "Nothing" is also a possible answer, but "go to heaven" is a more specific and commonly-believed outcome.
experience fear | Knowledge: Fear is a common and instinctual response to danger, and children often rely on this emotion to alert them to potential danger. Research has shown that even very young children are able to identify threatening or unsafe situations based on their emotional response. While some of the other options may be related to danger in certain contexts (such as listening for a noise that could indicate danger), experiencing fear is the most widely recognized and reliable indicator of danger for children.
judgement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the jury was tasked with making a decision regarding the sentence for a criminal defendant. "Passing sentence" is a phrase commonly used in legal contexts to refer to the act of deciding what punishment to impose on a convicted individual. "Judgement" is a term often used in legal settings to describe a decision reached by a court or jury. "Court house" and "go to jail" are not relevant to this particular sentence, while "death" and "appeals" are potentially related to legal proceedings but do not directly address the question of what the jury had to do to pass sentence.
minnesota | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a connection between hockey and a dentist being busy, indicating that there may be an increased demand for dental services in an area where hockey is popular. Minnesota is known for being home to several professional hockey teams and having a strong hockey culture, making it a likely choice for where a dentist may be busy due to hockey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: The question asks where to get corn if you don't have any, which suggests that you need to acquire it from somewhere else. The most common place to buy corn is at a supermarket, which is a retail store that sells groceries and other household items. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the question, as Pennsylvania is a state, silos and containers are storage facilities, and husks are a part of the corn plant.
old | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the young lady was drawn to the man's wealth and did not mind his age. "Old" is the only option that directly relates to age, while the other options do not provide any direct clue to the man's age. "Youngstock" may refer to young animals, "aged" may refer to something that has been aged, but it does not necessarily refer to age in humans, and "mature" and "senior" are often used to denote a certain stage in life but do not necessarily mean old age.
wild | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was originally kept in captivity at the zoo, but the protester stole it and returned it to its natural habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is "wild." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a glass cage is still a form of captivity, a restaurant is not a suitable habitat for a lizard, a garden may not be a suitable habitat for the specific type of lizard in question, and the Galapagos Archipelago is too far away and too specific to be a plausible answer.
study philosophy | Knowledge: The question asks about learning different ways of seeing the world, which is a topic that is often explored in philosophy. Studying philosophy involves examining different perspectives and ways of thinking about the world, which can lead to a deeper understanding of how people perceive the world around them. The other options do not have a clear connection to the topic of learning different ways of seeing the world.
peacefulness | Knowledge: The word "trance" suggests a state of altered consciousness that is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness. The other options, such as sleepwalking or memory loss, do not match the typical characteristics of a trance state. Hypnotized individuals may feel relaxed, but the term "trance" typically refers to a self-induced state of deep relaxation rather than a state induced by a hypnotist. Confusion is not typically associated with trance states.
desert | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah was managing an evacuation in a location that was difficult to navigate. The phrase "all around them" implies that the environment was a factor in why managing the evacuation was challenging. Of the options listed, "desert" is the most likely to present logistical difficulties during a crisis situation. The other options, such as "Egypt" or "city," could be challenging in their own right, but do not necessarily suggest the same kinds of obstacles as a desert environment.
receive mail | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person who answered the door was doing so in response to the mailman's knock. The most likely scenario following this interaction would be for the person to receive mail from the mailman. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
nice home | Knowledge: The question is asking about where someone doing housework is likely to work, so it makes the most sense that they would be working in a nice home, as housework is typically associated with maintaining a clean and tidy living space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, as they are either unrelated or not indicative of where housework is likely to take place.
understanding | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Jan struggles with studying and needs some form of assistance. Out of the given options, "understanding" makes the most sense in this context because gaining a better understanding of the material he is studying would likely improve his ability to learn and retain information. The other options (having a bigger brain, headaches, inspiration, and more intelligence) do not offer realistic or practical solutions to Jan's problem.
read book | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Charlie did not live near a school, which makes it unlikely that he attended one. The sentence also suggests that Charlie had a desire to learn, which makes it more likely that he turned to self-education. Of the choices, reading books is the most likely method for self-education, as it can be done at any time and from any location. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
riots | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that celebrating sports teams can sometimes become uncontrollable and chaotic. "Riots" is the most logical choice as it is commonly associated with such situations. "Dashing each others" is nonsensical and "intimacy" and "happiness" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Headaches" is a possible consequence of a riot, but it is not the best answer given the other choices.
getting hot | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to physical activity or exercise, specifically running. When you run, your body warms up and generates heat, which can cause your feet to sweat and your shoes to feel hot. The other options, such as losing laces or feeling tired, may be possible outcomes of running but are not directly related to what could happen to your shoes in this situation.
bear attack | Knowledge: The sentence implies a potential danger when fishing in a river and falling down, which could lead to a bear attack. Fishing and hiking in bear country require safety precautions, such as carrying bear spray, making noise and keeping a safe distance from wildlife. The other options are not related to falling down while fishing in a river.
theater | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Bob raising a curtain, which suggests that he might work in a theater. Moreover, the sentence hints at a crowded atmosphere, which is commonly associated with theaters during performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
happy | Knowledge: The question asks for the opposite of "unhappy," which is a word commonly associated with the emotion of sadness or a negative feeling. The other options are all synonyms of "happy" or express positive emotions, but do not fit the context of the question as an opposite. "Fat" is not a relevant option as it is not a feeling or emotion.
die | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to the act of murder, which typically involves taking someone else's life. Therefore, the requirement for committing murder is that someone must die. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
were sad | Knowledge: The fact that Sam would cry while watching the movie implies that it had a sad or emotional storyline. The other answer choices are either too extreme or do not accurately reflect the tone of the movie as described in the sentence. "Were sad" is the best fit because it conveys the idea that the movie was emotionally moving and likely had a sad ending or storyline.
aircraft | Knowledge: The verb "take flight" suggests that the answer involves a mode of transportation that can fly or lift off the ground. Out of the options listed, only "aircraft" fits this description as it refers to vehicles designed for air travel. The other options - school, band, factory, and car - do not have any connection to flight or air travel.
make eye contact | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question valued formality and likely made an effort to display proper social behavior. Making eye contact is one of the key ways to establish a connection and show respect when talking to others. The other options may also be effective ways of showing respect and formality, but they are not as directly connected to the sentence as making eye contact.
require water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dogs need to stay hydrated on hot days, which is why it's important to keep their bowl full. "Require water" is the answer that directly addresses this need for hydration. "Do many things," "trained," "withstand dehydration," and "get lost" are not related to the context of the sentence and do not answer the question asked.
house | Knowledge: In the context of the sentence, the family wants to buy a heater to warm their living space. Therefore, the correct answer is "house." The other options (automobile, city hall, public building, office) do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not typically require or benefit from having a heater installed.
office | Knowledge: A business telephone directory is typically used in a professional or work setting, so it would make sense to keep it in an office where it would be easily accessible to employees who need it. The other options, such as a house or phone booth, do not make sense as places to keep a business telephone directory. Book shelves or a building might be possible options, but office is the most specific and appropriate choice given the context.
locker room | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James needed to store his duffel bag temporarily because he couldn't carry it with him. The options "bag lady's shopping cart" and "army barracks" are not likely locations for James to store his personal belongings. "Bus station" and "transit" are also unlikely options as they imply that James was travelling, which is not specified in the sentence. "Locker room" is the most suitable option as it is a common place for people to store their personal items when they don't want to carry them around.
molehill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist found something amusing while hiking, and that it was related to a saying. The next part of the sentence mentions "spotted a what," implying that the protagonist saw something on the mountain. The word "Chuckled" suggests that whatever he saw was not serious or dangerous. Thus, among the options, a molehill fits the context best. It is a small and harmless feature of the landscape that is not commonly spotted while hiking, and it can be humorously compared to a mountain. The other options don't fit as well because they are either too big or too difficult to spot while hiking.
going to jail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe did something very bad and is worried about being punished by The People. Going to jail is a common punishment for criminal activities and is a reasonable choice for Joe to be worried about. The other options, such as train or hatred, do not make sense in the context of punishment. "Get angry" and "public outrage" are not punishments but rather emotional responses to Joe's actions.
watch tv | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are engaging in a sedentary lifestyle by sitting on the couch all day, which is a behavior commonly associated with watching TV. The comparison to a bad diet implies that this behavior is unhealthy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
entertaining | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that we are looking for an adjective to describe something related to television that we enjoy watching a lot. The option "entertaining" fits this description as it means something that is enjoyable or amusing. The other options "legal," "complex expensive and inflexible," "obsolete," and "awesome" do not necessarily have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
atheism | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are presented with hard science facts, some of them tend to turn away from their previously held beliefs, which is a characteristic commonly associated with atheism. Atheism is a lack of belief in a god or gods, and scientific facts and evidence can contradict many religious beliefs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
canter | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the horses are moving quickly in a specific direction, which is a characteristic of the canter gait. Canter is a three-beat gait that is faster than a trot, but not as fast as a gallop. Trot is a two-beat diagonal gait, while eat oats and drink water are completely unrelated to the question. Herd may be a possible distraction, but it refers to a group of animals, not their movement.
dirt and seeds | Knowledge: Apple trees require soil to grow in, as this is where they obtain the necessary nutrients and water for their growth. They also require seeds to start growing, as this is how apple trees reproduce. The other options, South Africa, park, and paradise, are not relevant to the growth of apple trees.
resort hotel | Knowledge: The context suggests that the tourists were in a location where they had access to a swimming pool that was separated from the rest of the country, indicating that they were likely in a private, controlled setting such as a resort hotel. The other options, such as a jungle or a motel, do not typically have such amenities and would not be likely places for an isolated swimming pool. The YMCA and California are both too broad to determine whether they have isolated swimming pools.
medicine bottle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object is specifically designed for storing and dispensing pills. The options "medicine cabinet," "pharmacy," and "box" are too general and could refer to a variety of objects that may or may not be used for storing pills. "Jar" is too vague and does not necessarily imply a twisting motion to dispense pills. "Medicine bottle" is the most specific and appropriate option, as it is a common household item used for storing and dispensing medication, and often requires a twisting motion to open.
feel better about yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam believes that improving oneself involves taking time to collect one's thoughts and clear one's mind. This sort of self-improvement would likely result in a person feeling better about themselves, which is the best answer choice in the given options. The other options - learning something new, doing yoga, meditating, and celebrating - do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the idea of improving oneself through reflection and mental preparedness.
everywhere | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about the location of something or someone (in this case, God). The phrase "at all times" suggests that God is believed to be omnipresent, or present everywhere at once. This is a common belief in many religions and is often described as one of God's attributes. The other options do not relate to the concept of God's location.
market | Knowledge: A market is a place where goods or services are bought and sold, and often has multiple vendors offering a variety of products for sale. The other options do not necessarily involve buying and selling products, or do not fit the context of the sentence (such as "cost one dollar"). A shelf may have products for sale, but it suggests a more limited selection and is often associated with retail stores rather than a marketplace. A salon is typically associated with personal services such as haircuts or beauty treatments, rather than buying products, and a demonstration suggests a presentation or exhibition rather than a commercial venue for selling goods.
at hotel | Knowledge: Music is often played in elevators to create a calming and pleasant atmosphere. While music may be played in other settings such as malls or buildings, hotels are particularly known for playing background music in elevators to enhance the guest experience. The other options do not have any clear association with the practice of playing music in elevators.
entertained | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the book is enjoyable and keeping the reader's interest, which is commonly associated with entertainment. While reading a good book may also lead to gaining knowledge, understanding, and a new perspective, the context of the sentence focuses on the enjoyment of the reading experience.
eye | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small grain of sand can have a transformative effect on something, and the answer choice that fits this context best is "eye." This is because pearls are formed when a grain of sand gets inside an oyster or mollusk's shell and irritates its soft tissue. Over time, the mollusk will secrete a substance called nacre around the sand particle, which creates a smooth, shiny surface that we recognize as a pearl. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to this process.
branch out | Knowledge: When a tree is first growing, it is still developing its branches and structure. As it grows, it will begin to branch out in various directions, creating a fuller and more complex shape. This is a natural process for trees, and is essential for their growth and survival. The other options do not make sense in the context of a tree that is just starting to grow.
math class | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to a specific subject, namely mathematics. Measuring triangles is a fundamental concept in geometry, which is a branch of mathematics. Additionally, the other choices are not related to the subject matter of the sentence and do not make sense contextually.
carton | Knowledge: The question is asking what keeps a cigarette fresh, which suggests that the answer must relate to preserving the quality of the cigarette. The option "carton" is the most logical answer because a carton helps to protect the cigarettes from moisture and air that can cause them to dry out or lose their flavor. The other options are all unrelated or even harmful to keeping a cigarette fresh.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking to buy a fishing rod, which is a type of equipment used for fishing. Therefore, it would make sense to look for a store that specializes in selling sporting goods such as fishing equipment. The other options do not make sense in the context of buying a fishing rod.
two feet | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that humans buy shoes in pairs, which indicates that they are intended to be worn on both feet. The other choices are not relevant to the context and do not explain why shoes are sold in pairs.
bite | Knowledge: Biting is the first step in the process of eating food. Chewing, drinking, and cooking are all actions that can happen during the eating process, but they do not explain how someone starts eating in the first place. Watching TV is also not related to the act of eating.
supermarket | Knowledge: The word "variety" suggests that there are different types of bread available. Supermarkets typically offer a wide selection of bread, including specialty breads, artisanal breads, and international varieties. The other options (room, dinner, plastic bag, refrigerator) do not make sense in the context of the question and do not suggest a place where bread can be found.
overconfidence | Knowledge: The sentence implies that being too sure of one's learning can have a negative consequence. "Overconfidence" is a common outcome of being too sure of oneself, where someone may become complacent and stop seeking new knowledge. "Growth," "gaining knowledge," "enlightenment," and "knowing more" are all positive outcomes of learning and do not align with the context of the sentence.
power | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people in question were looking for information on their political enemies, which suggests a desire to gain an advantage over them. In politics, information can often be used as a tool to gain leverage or influence over others, which is a key characteristic of power. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as understanding, answers, happiness, and knowledge do not necessarily lead to the acquisition of power.
water plants | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a lack of precipitation, which means that there might not be enough water for the plants. Farmers typically have to water their plants manually or use irrigation systems during dry periods to ensure that their crops receive enough water to grow. Rising early, raising crops, planting, and canning produce are not directly related to the issue of a lack of precipitation.
maritime museum | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the shark has been stuffed and preserved as a specimen for display. This would typically be done in a museum or educational setting. The term "maritime" refers to things related to the sea, such as boats, navigation, and marine life, so a maritime museum would be a likely place to display a preserved shark. The other options - deep ocean, pope's office, pool hall, and great outdoors - do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
heart rate increases | Knowledge: When a person goes jogging, their body begins to exert itself, leading to an increase in heart rate. This is because the body needs to pump more blood and oxygen to the muscles in order to sustain the physical activity. Eating ice cream is not typically associated with jogging, as it is a sugary food that can lead to heaviness in the stomach. While jogging can help with weight loss, it is not a direct activity that someone does while jogging. Getting tired and heavy breathing can be side effects of jogging, but they are not the main action that someone does while jogging.
parcel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the address label was attached to something that weighs 3 pounds, which rules out options like envelope, shelf, and desk drawer. Junk mail is also unlikely to weigh that much. A parcel, on the other hand, is a package or box that can easily weigh 3 pounds or more, making it the most likely answer.
river delta | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that there are many swamps in the southern U.S., which suggests that the answer should refer to a specific geographic feature commonly found in this region. A river delta is a landform created by the deposition of sediment at the mouth of a river, and is often associated with wetland habitats like swamps. Michigan is not located in the southern U.S. and is not known for its swamps, while Louisiana is famous for its wetlands and alligators but does not specify the geographic feature in question.
nursery school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher was responsible for changing diapers, which is a task commonly associated with working in a nursery school or preschool setting where young children are in attendance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
watch television | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man wants to catch his favorite show, which implies that he needs to watch television. Clapping, feeling happy, and relaxing do not directly relate to watching television, while recording the show might be an option, it is not necessarily the most likely thing for the man to do, as he simply wants to catch the show, not necessarily keep a copy of it.
arm | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that "the humorous" is a bone, which suggests that this is a question related to anatomy. The humorous is actually a bone in the upper arm, specifically in the area between the shoulder and elbow joints. This bone is also known as the humerus, and it is one of the largest bones in the human body. The other options in the question do not have any connection to anatomy or the location of bones.
city | Knowledge: Bus stops, especially those located downtown, are typically operated and maintained by the city's transportation department or a contracted bus operator that operates in the city. Urban areas and towns may have bus stops as well, but they are less likely to be downtown and may be operated by a different entity. Airports, while they have bus stops, are not usually located downtown and are not responsible for operating city bus stops.
health centre | Knowledge: The question asks about a place where a spa is likely to be found alongside similar services, which suggests a location that specializes in health and wellness. Out of the given options, a health centre is the most likely option to offer a spa alongside other health-related services such as massages or acupuncture, for example. Sweden, backyard, house or country club do not necessarily have a clear connection to health and wellness services or spas.
race cars | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that thrill seeking people who love competition could possibly be found in one of the choices provided. Out of the options, "race cars" is the most likely choice as it is a competitive sport that involves speed and danger, attracting thrill seekers who enjoy taking risks. The other choices, such as "a taxi cab," "learn from each other," and "fear death," do not correlate with the idea of competing and seeking thrills. "Fight each other" could be seen as competitive, but the sentence implies that the choice is related to a specific activity or location, rather than a general behavior.
being clear | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was preparing for a bath and was looking for a specific quality in the water. The phrase "being clear" indicates that the man was searching for water that was transparent and free from impurities or dirt. This is a common expectation when someone is preparing for a bath, as the purpose of the bath is usually to clean oneself. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "get wet" is not something one needs to search for when preparing for a bath, "bathing soap" is an accessory and not a quality of the water, "will drown" is not a desirable outcome of bathing, and "personal cleanliness" is the purpose of the bath, not a quality of the water.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam's job involves handling cash as a cashier, and he is good at it despite the hectic and tiring nature of the job. Among the choices, only a supermarket is commonly known to have cashiers who may work in a standing position and handle a lot of customers, making it a more likely workplace for Sam. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
club | Knowledge: The word "gentleman" suggests that the person in question is a male of good breeding and manners. The fact that he is from France is also relevant, as it suggests that he may be interested in joining a social or cultural organization where he can meet fellow French expats, or perhaps an international club where he can network and socialize with people from all over the world. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general (europe) or unrelated to the idea of socializing and networking (suit, university, church, restaurant).
disappointment | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the presents she was getting were not what she wanted, which suggests she had expected or hoped for something specific. This indicates that she may have been looking forward to receiving a particular gift that did not end up being part of her presents, leading to disappointment. The other options, such as excitement or satisfaction, would not be appropriate in this context where the speaker is unhappy with the nature of the gifts they were receiving.
clothing store | Knowledge: Dressing rooms are typically found in clothing stores, where customers try on clothes before purchasing them. Gyms have changing rooms, but not specifically for trying on clothes. The term "body" is too vague and could apply to any location that pertains to the human body. Department stores may have dressing rooms, but the context of the sentence specifically mentions "all types of things," which suggests a focus on clothing. Closets are located in homes and not typically available for public use.
fear death | Knowledge: The phrase "crossing over" is often used as a euphemism for dying or passing away. This suggests that the people mentioned in the sentence are referring to the fear of death. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hallucination | Knowledge: Going into a trance is often associated with a state of altered consciousness that can be induced by various factors, such as repetitive chanting, music, or hypnosis. Hallucination, the perception of things that are not actually present, is a common experience during trance-like states. Disorientation, loss of control, closed eyes, and confusion may also occur during a trance, but they are not necessarily the reason for entering a trance state.
eating | Knowledge: The question is asking what someone needs when they're feeling hunger, so the best answer would be the option that satisfies that need. Hunger is a biological signal that our bodies use to signal the need for food, so the correct answer would be "eating". The other options are either inappropriate (starvation) or specific foods that may or may not be able to satisfy hunger (hamburger, pizza) or a symptom of hunger rather than the need itself (discomfort).
hardware store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sally is looking for a specific tool, which is a stepladder. A hardware store is a common place where one can buy different types of tools, including stepladders. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A construction worker's vehicle or tool shed may have a stepladder, but Sally wouldn't know where to find them. Elevators and store rooms are unlikely places to find a stepladder.
kitchen | Knowledge: The question is asking where you would get knives if you don't have any. The most logical answer would be the kitchen, as that is where knives are typically kept in a household. The other options may also have knives, but they are less likely to have knives that are suitable for general use, such as cooking or cutting. A restaurant may have specialized knives for food preparation, but they may not be available for purchase. A sporting goods store may have knives for hunting or camping, but they may not be appropriate for everyday use. A drawer or backpack may have knives, but it is unclear where these items are located and if they are available for use.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is struggling to finish reading a book because they are tired or sleepy. The phrase "kept" implies that the person is trying to stay awake, but is having difficulty doing so. "Falling asleep" is the most likely choice because it accurately reflects this situation. "Sit" and "learning" do not make sense in this context, and "the light on" is a distractor that does not relate to the sentence.
Mexico | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a border between Colorado and a neighboring nation, and that nation is two states away. The only option that fits this description is Mexico, as it shares a border with several US states, including Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, which are all directly or indirectly adjacent to Colorado. The other options do not fit the criteria described in the sentence.
feel anger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the killing of a young community member has caused a strong emotional reaction among people. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Get in trouble" and "commit crime" imply that people are somehow responsible for the killing, which is not necessarily the case. "Die" and "getting hurt" are also not logical responses to the situation.
suffer hunger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people have no nourishment, they experience a negative consequence. The phrase "suffer hunger" directly relates to the lack of nourishment, whereas the other options do not. Boarding ships, studying books, playing computer games, and believing in god do not have a direct correlation to the lack of nourishment.
bulge | Knowledge: The context suggests that the woman was wearing tight jeans in order to draw attention to a particular part of her body. The word "thigh" in the sentence helps to narrow down the answer choices to those that are related to clothing or fashion. Of the options given, "bulge" is the only choice that suggests a visual aspect of the woman's appearance that might be emphasized by wearing tight clothing. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
hiccup |  | Knowledge: Eating very quickly and jumping up and down are both actions that can cause a disruption in the normal functioning of the diaphragm muscle. This disruption can lead to a spasm in the muscle, which causes the characteristic "hic" sound. Therefore, it is likely that hiccups will occur after eating quickly and jumping up and down. None of the other options have any clear association with these actions.
trouble | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sahmbi was intentionally misleading someone about the location of a fugitive, and the reason he was doing this was to avoid facing consequences or punishment. The term "trouble" is often used to describe negative consequences that someone may face for their actions, which is why it is the most likely choice in this context. The other options do not fit as well because they do not convey the sense of negative consequences that the sentence suggests.
find information | Knowledge: The word "ignorance" suggests a lack of knowledge or information about a particular topic. Therefore, the most logical answer would be to find information. The other options do not directly address the issue of not knowing something and may not lead to the acquisition of new knowledge.
house or other building | Knowledge: The question is asking about where works would typically be located on the wall, which suggests that they would be displayed in a setting where people would typically view them. The most likely place for that to occur would be in a house or other building, such as a museum or gallery. The other options do not provide a clear context for where works would be displayed on the wall.
listening to music | Knowledge: The question states that you are relaxing and have your eyes closed, which suggests that you are engaging in an activity that does not require visual focus. The options "read book", "watching tv", and "reading" all involve visual engagement, which is therefore unlikely. "Falling asleep" is also unlikely since the question specifies that you are still awake. "Listening to music", however, is an activity that can easily be done with eyes closed and also fits the context of relaxation.
brook | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer must be a body of water that is similar to a stream. A brook is a small, shallow stream, while a synagogue and pastry have no connection to the context of the sentence. An ocean is a large body of saltwater and is not similar to a stream. A cup of coffee is a beverage and not a body of water.
stripes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lines on the car are related to racing, which is a sport associated with speed and competition. Stripes are commonly used on racing cars to identify them and to make them more visually appealing. The other options do not have any clear connection to racing or the context of the sentence.
enjoyment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific reason why people participate in surfing, and the word "primarily" implies that this reason is the main motivation for most surfers. While getting in shape and getting wet may be secondary benefits of surfing, neither of these options reflects the main reason why people choose to partake in the sport. Shark attacks, although they are a risk associated with surfing, are not a reason why someone would choose to surf. Therefore, enjoyment is the most likely correct answer. Surfing is a popular recreational activity that is enjoyed by many people around the world, and the exhilaration of riding waves is often cited as the primary reason why people choose to participate in it.
sweat | Knowledge: When we exercise and run, our body temperature increases, and we start to sweat to cool down. Sweat is a clear fluid that is released through the sweat glands in our skin, and it helps regulate our body temperature. Movement, exercising, and sex are all associated with physical activity, but they do not specifically relate to the act of sweating during exercise. Moist could be a possibility, but it is not as specific as sweat in this context.
high school | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the setting of the amateur play is likely a school auditorium, as high schools often have theater programs and host plays. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of watching an amateur play in an auditorium.
united states of america | Knowledge: An interstate highway is a type of highway system that runs across multiple states within the United States. Therefore, the correct answer is the United States of America. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they do not accurately describe what an interstate highway is or what it goes across.
China | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific geographic location, the base of the ancient longest wall. This is referring to the Great Wall of China, which is the longest wall in the world and located in China. The other options do not have any connection to the Great Wall or China.
permitted | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the government made a decision to change a previous rule or practice. The word "allow" indicates that the government was giving permission or lifting a prohibition. The word "once" indicates that the government's decision represented a change from a prior state. The only option that fits this context is "permitted." The other options all suggest that the government was maintaining or reinstating a restriction.
dashboard | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer refers to a feature found in a car. An LED (light-emitting diode) is commonly used in electronic displays, which are often found on a car's dashboard to show information such as speed and fuel levels. The other options, such as electronics and pc board, are too broad and do not narrow down the answer to a specific part of a car.
keep quiet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lawyers were doing something specific while they were growing up, which may indicate a characteristic or trait that is common among lawyers. Keeping quiet could be associated with confidentiality, which is an essential part of the legal profession. Lawyers need to keep their clients' information confidential and not disclose it to anyone else unless mandated by law. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
restaurant | Knowledge: The word "plate" in this context typically refers to a dish of food served at a restaurant or eatery. This is a common term used in the food service industry to describe meals that are served on a plate. The other options (kitchen cupboard, table, banquet, cabinet) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bowling alley | Knowledge: Bowling is a sport that involves rolling a ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down a set of pins at the end of the lane. A ball is typically used in this context, which is why the correct answer is likely to be a bowling alley. The other options, such as pool tables or playgrounds, do not typically involve the use of a ball to knock things down as the primary objective of the activity.
use mobile phone | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is exploring possible distractions that can occur when driving a car. Using a mobile phone is a commonly cited distraction that can take a driver's attention away from the road and increase the risk of automobile accidents. The other options are either outcomes of distractions (car crash and automobile accidents) or unrelated to the context (smoke and backache).
show | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exceptional performances are being referenced, which is typically associated with a live show. While bands, operas, and ball events can all provide live shows, the word "performances" is a key word that highlights the relevance of the choice "show" over the others. The phrase "fine tune instruments" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as it does not fit the context of the sentence.
milwaukee | Knowledge: Schlitz is a beer that was originally brewed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is Milwaukee, as that is where the beer originates from. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
beach | Knowledge: Mexico is known for its beautiful beaches and is a popular tourist destination for this reason. Many people go to Mexico specifically to enjoy the beaches, which are often lined with resorts and other tourist attractions. The other options, such as zoo, waterfall, homes, or Disneyland, do not have the same level of popularity or association with Mexico's tourism industry.
utah | Knowledge: The reference to the Mormon ownership of the steak house suggests a connection to the state of Utah, which has a sizable population of Mormons. Additionally, the fact that the steak house is always busy implies that it is located in a popular area, and Utah's reputation as a tourist destination makes it a likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
apartment building | Knowledge: Multiple closets are often found in apartment buildings because they are designed to accommodate the storage needs of multiple tenants. Individual apartments typically have several closets for storing clothes, linens, and other household items. Hotels may have closets in their rooms, but they usually only have one per room. Bedrooms and houses also have closets, but it is not specified whether they have multiple ones or not. Schools do not typically have closets unless they are used for storage purposes.
glass | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a container that one uses to drink out of. The other choices, choking, smoke, swallowing, and mouth, do not align with that context. Additionally, "glass" is a common material for drinking vessels, whereas the other options do not typically serve that purpose.
efficiency | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that splitting up tasks into nearby blocks was a deliberate choice made by Joe, John, and Sylvia, implying that there was some practical benefit to doing so. The use of the word "efficiency" in the answer reflects this implication, as it suggests that dividing tasks in this manner allows for the completion of all tasks in a quicker and more streamlined manner. The other options (stress, aggravation, freed up time, net gain) do not seem to logically match with the idea of splitting up tasks into nearby blocks.
communication | Knowledge: Chatting with friends implies exchanging ideas, opinions, and thoughts between two or more people. Communication is the act of exchanging information or messages through different channels such as speech, writing, or technology. Fun, happiness, and laughter can occur during communication, but they are not types of communication. Agreement refers to reaching a consensus, which is not necessarily the goal of chatting with friends.
unhappiness | Knowledge: Lying can break trust and damage the relationship between spouses, which is likely to result in unhappiness. While there may be exceptions to this, such as when the lie is told to protect the other person, the question does not provide any context that would suggest that this is the case. The other answer choices are not relevant to the question and do not provide any logical reason or context to support their selection.
mix with people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to make new friends by interacting with people at the party. "Mix with people" means to engage or mingle with others, which is likely to lead to meeting new people and potentially making friends. "Find friends" implies that the person will search for existing friends, rather than making new ones. "Sing" and "see people" are not relevant to the goal of making new friends. Therefore, the correct answer is "mix with people."
jazz band | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Artie Shaw became famous playing the clarinet, which is an instrument commonly associated with jazz music. Jazz bands are typically made up of several musicians playing different instruments, including the clarinet, and are known for their improvisational style of playing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
apartment | Knowledge: The word "kitchenette" suggests a small kitchen area, which is often found in apartments rather than houses or dorm rooms. The phrase "stacked on top of each other" implies that the dwelling type is a multi-story building like an apartment complex, and not a one-story apartment or a house. A hotel room may have a mini-fridge and a microwave, but these do not qualify as a kitchenette.
office building | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the meeting was specifically for business owners, suggesting that it was held in a location where multiple businesses are housed together. The term "committee" also suggests that this meeting was held internally among the business owners, rather than a meeting hosted by a city or government entity. The options town, government, and city hall do not fit the context of the sentence, while boardroom does not necessarily imply a meeting among business owners. Therefore, office building is the most fitting choice.
suburb | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family previously lived in the city where they didn't have a back yard, but now they do. This indicates that they likely moved to a more residential area. The options "farm" and "property" imply a larger land area than a typical residential property, making them less likely choices. "Neighborhood" and "yards" are also too generic and do not provide specific information about the family's living situation. Therefore, "suburb" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a residential area with houses and yards.
college campus | Knowledge: Parking structures are commonly utilized at places with high traffic and limited space, such as college campuses. College students often need a place to park their cars while attending classes and living on campus, making a parking structure a practical solution for managing the influx of vehicles. The other options may have parking structures, but they do not necessarily have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
dry clothes | Knowledge: Hanging clothes in the sun is a common method used to dry laundry quickly and naturally. Sunlight helps to evaporate moisture from the fabric, which is why it is often used as a laundry drying method. The other options do not make sense in this context - warming a room or a house would not be achieved by drying clothes outside, fading colors would be an unwanted result of exposure to sunlight, and promoting browning of skin implies sun tanning, which is not related to laundry.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bus boy was cleaning up after dinner, and specifically mentions clearing the dishes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the bus boy was wiping the crumbs off the table. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the marker will be needed again in the near future at the same location. Keeping the marker in a pocket would allow for easy access and quick retrieval for future use. The other options do not provide the convenience and accessibility needed for the situation.
armored car | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about transportation used by soldiers in combat or on the move. Carriages and tents are unlikely choices as they are not practical for military operations. Trenches are not a mode of transportation, but rather a form of defensive structure. The most practical mode of transportation for soldiers on the move or in combat situations is an armored car, which offers protection and mobility. The option "battlefield" is not a mode of transportation, but rather a place where soldiers engage in combat.
die suddenly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the impact of a bullet to the head is most likely fatal, resulting in sudden death. It is reasonable to assume that the other options are not relevant or likely outcomes of being shot in the head.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person keeps their teddy bear in their own room, which is typically found in their home. The other options do not make sense in this context. A shelf may be in a home, but it does not necessarily indicate that a teddy bear is kept there. A gas station is not a logical place to keep a teddy bear. A toy store is where teddy bears are sold, not kept by individuals.
furniture store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to acquire a chair to take home, which can be done by purchasing one from a furniture store. A furniture store is a retail business that sells furniture, such as chairs and other household items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a university, office, or church may not have chairs available for purchase, and going home would not provide a solution for acquiring a new chair.
junkyard | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a place to buy previously owned metal items. Hobby Lobby and instruments may sell metal items, but they are unlikely to sell used items. Ore is a type of raw material used to make metal, not a place to buy used metal items. Cars may contain metal parts, but they are not a place to specifically buy used metal items. A junkyard, on the other hand, is a common place to find previously owned and used metal items, making it the most likely correct answer.
wedding | Knowledge: Weddings are typically joyful events where people come together to celebrate the union and love between two people. The atmosphere is often filled with happiness, laughter, and positive emotions, which makes it a likely place for people to feel joyous. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
foreigner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean found his native English speaking ability helpful, implying that Ludwig did not have the same advantage. The word "foreigner" is the only option that directly relates to the idea of not being a native speaker of a language. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
cubicle | Knowledge: The sentence is asking where you would feel cramped in a cubicle, suggesting that a cubicle is a confined space. The other options do not relate to a confined workspace like a cubicle. "Work" is too general and could refer to any workspace, while "bank" and "office building" could have more spacious office layouts. "Constructing office space" is not a location where someone would feel cramped, but rather a job task. "Home office" may be a small workspace but it doesn't specifically mention a cubicle.
hyperventilation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a type of breathing that can be harmful, which rules out the options "stay alive" and "continue to live" as they are not types of breathing. Hyperventilation is a known medical condition where a person breathes rapidly and shallowly, which can lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in the blood and cause symptoms such as dizziness, tingling, and chest pain. In contrast, "relaxation" and "panting" are not typically associated with any significant health risks.
Montana | Knowledge: The question suggests that malls are typically found in areas with large groups of people, and the choices include different types of areas. Downtown areas and large cities are often associated with bustling crowds and high population density, which make them likely places to find malls. Urban areas and suburbs are also densely populated and often have shopping centers. However, Montana is a rural state with a much lower population density, making it less likely to have a mall. Therefore, Montana is the correct answer.
carnival | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a festival happening in town, which typically involves outdoor activities, vendors, and food stalls. Among the options provided, "carnival" is the most likely choice as it commonly features lemonade and refreshments. The other options, such as "cabin" or "refrigerator," are unlikely to offer lemonade in the given context.
society | Knowledge: The word "fit in" implies a desire to belong or conform to a larger group. Out of the given choices, only society refers to a group of people with shared values, beliefs, and customs. The other choices, such as government and nature, do not necessarily involve a sense of belonging or conformity. The natural world and humanity are very broad categories that do not necessarily involve social interaction.
restaurant | Knowledge: An eatery is a place where people go to eat, and a restaurant is a specific type of eatery where customers order food from a menu and have it served to them. The other options, such as commercial buildings, malls, and towns, could also have restaurants within them, but they are not necessarily the same as being in a restaurant specifically. The option "country" is also not appropriate for this question, as it refers to a geographic location rather than a type of establishment.
wonder | Knowledge: Visiting a museum is often associated with experiencing wonder or amazement at the works of art or exhibits on display. The other options don't align with common experiences people have when visiting a museum, such as being bored or having sore feet. Live shows may be part of a museum's programming, but it doesn't capture the overall experience of visiting a museum. Retrospection is not necessarily a reason people go to museums, but rather a possible outcome of reflecting on what they have seen.
become angry | Knowledge: The word "conflicts" suggests a disagreement or argument between people, which often leads to negative emotions such as anger. "Party" and "believe in god" are not necessarily related to conflicts, while "agree or disagree" is an action that may or may not lead to anger. "Gain weight" does not make sense in this context.
learning | Knowledge: The sentence states that living life involves both good and bad experiences, and suggests that we should do something with them. "Learning" is the most logical option, as it implies that we can gain knowledge or wisdom from our experiences, both positive and negative, and use that knowledge to improve ourselves or our situations in the future. The other options - making love, getting married, having children, and repeating - do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
world | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place where all creatures live, which suggests a broad and inclusive location. The world is a logical answer because it encompasses all living creatures across different environments such as oceans, forests, and deserts. The other options do not satisfy this requirement: zoos only contain a limited number of species in captivity, dark places like caves and underground tunnels may not support all types of creatures, lakes only support aquatic life, and woods may not have all species in significant numbers.
library | Knowledge: A library is a place where multiple people can access and use resources, such as books or newspapers. It is common for libraries to have only one telephone book that patrons can use, as it is not necessary for each individual to have their own copy. The other options, such as a desk or bedroom, are usually private spaces that are not intended for public use. Similarly, while a hotel may have a telephone book, it is not typically available for general use by guests.
bedroom | Knowledge: Comforters are often used on beds for added warmth and comfort during sleep. Therefore, it would make sense for someone to store their comforter in the same room where they sleep, which is typically the bedroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah left her purse at home and as a result, she couldn't wear the clothes she wanted. The logical conclusion would be for her to drive back home to retrieve her purse. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
compassion | Knowledge: The sentence provides information about Billy's personality, stating that he is a "big-hearted person" who wants to understand people better. This suggests that Billy is empathetic and compassionate towards others, which would be the reason he wants to understand them better. The other options do not necessarily relate to understanding people better from an emotional standpoint.
help them | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher has some sort of role in relation to the student over the course of a semester. The correct answer can be inferred from the phrase "what does a teacher do for a student," which implies that the teacher has a supportive role. The other options don't fit this context as well, as preparing dinner or working in school are not typically teacher responsibilities, including examples might be a part of helping a student, and evaluating progress is only one aspect of the teacher's overall role.
surface of earth | Knowledge: Compost is usually made by combining organic materials such as food scraps and yard waste and allowing them to decompose over time. This process occurs naturally on the surface of the earth, where microorganisms break down the material and turn it into nutrient-rich soil. Compost is typically used in gardens and other outdoor spaces to improve soil quality and promote healthy plant growth. The other options do not make sense in the context of composting.
precious | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the metal being described is of high value or quality, which is commonly associated with precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. The other options do not convey a sense of value or quality and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
drink beer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is something specific that adults can do in the morning that young children cannot. Since drinking beer is an activity that is restricted to those who are of legal drinking age, and children are not of legal drinking age, it is the most likely answer. The other options do not contain something that specifically distinguishes adults from young children in the morning.
competition | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is something that motivates people to play well in fencing, and the most likely option is competition. Fencing is a competitive sport, and athletes who participate in it may be motivated by the desire to win or to perform well in front of others. The other options, such as judge, perspiration, injury, and severe injuries, do not fit the context of the sentence or are not things that typically motivate fencers.
bankruptcy | Knowledge: The phrase "going to market" often refers to selling something, which in this case, is a house. The word "bankruptcy" suggests that the owner may be forced to sell the house to pay off debts. The other options do not provide a clear reason for the house to be sold.
accord or rapport | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the people are in agreement or harmony with each other. "Accord" means to agree or be in harmony, while "rapport" refers to a positive relationship or understanding between people. "Smiles" could also suggest agreement, but it is not as specific as "accord" or "rapport." "Dissonance" means lack of harmony or agreement, and "band together" suggests uniting for a common cause rather than agreeing with each other.
movie | Knowledge: Popcorn is a common snack to eat while watching a movie, so the context suggests that the correct answer is the movie theater. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
blues band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is skilled with a harmonica, which is commonly used in blues music. Blues music often features solos played on the harmonica, and the genre has a long history of famous harmonica players. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the library is restricted to only friends, which implies a personal or private setting. College, hotel, school, and downtown are all public places where anyone can go, so they are less likely to have a restricted-access library. A house, on the other hand, can be a private residence where only friends are allowed, making it a more plausible location for a library that only friends can visit.
admiration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person got tickets to a performance of their idol, indicating that they have a great deal of respect and admiration for this person. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - experience, statue, applaud, and make reservations do not convey the same level of excitement or emotion as admiration.
shiver | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that not using a towel after getting wet could lead to a physical reaction in the body. Shivering is a natural response to feeling cold, and if the body is wet and not dried off, it may feel cold and shiver in an attempt to warm up. The other options, such as shrinkage or getting melted, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence mentions snare drum players and a sports game, which suggests a connection to marching band. Marching band is often seen performing at sporting events, and snare drum is a common instrument used in marching band performances. The other options, such as high school band or orchestra, do not necessarily have a connection to sports games or snare drum playing.
create images using words | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a poet who is telling stories about exotic locations has to use words to create images in the reader's mind. This is a common technique used in poetry, where the poet uses descriptive language to create a vivid picture of a scene or location. The other options may also be used in poetry, but they are not specifically related to the context of the sentence.
phone booth | Knowledge: The question is asking where a public call can be made, which suggests that it is not in a private location. A phone booth is a public space that is specifically designed for making phone calls, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to public phone calls. A clothing store, workplace, swimming pool, or phone mount are all locations where a phone call could be made, but they are not necessarily public.
residence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is an indoor-only pet, which implies that it stays inside a residence of some sort. The other options do not make sense in this context - a front door is not a place to stay, a zoo is not a suitable environment for a house cat, and a jail cell is a completely inappropriate location. "Floor" is too general and could apply to any indoor space.
stop working | Knowledge: A clockmaker is someone who repairs and maintains clocks. Therefore, it would make sense to bring a clock to a clockmaker when it stops working or needs repair. The other choices are not directly related to the purpose of a clockmaker. Storing a clock is a responsibility of the owner, timing an event can be done by any functioning clock, telling time can be done by any clock or watch, and winding down a clock is a routine maintenance task that can be done by the owner.
garden | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was a respected individual who cared for the environment and gave back to the community. Being memorialized on a bench is often associated with being remembered in a peaceful and tranquil setting, such as a garden. Rest areas, bus depots, and banks are not typically associated with memorials, while state parks could be a possible answer, but a garden is more likely given the context of the sentence.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the view of stars through a window is not something that occurs commonly or easily. The phrase "out the window" implies a view from above, which suggests that the context is related to flying or being in space. The option "space shuttle" is the most closely related to this context, while the other options do not make sense in this scenario.
talk to themselves | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking to oneself is a behavior that may lead others to think a person is crazy. This is because talking to oneself is often associated with mental illness or instability. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unhappy with the plain landscape of their new home, which could indicate a preference for a different type of geography. The word "miss" also implies that the person had experienced a different type of geography before. Of the options, "mountain" is a type of geography that is often associated with grandeur and beauty, which may explain why the person misses it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
teetotaler | Knowledge: A drunkard is someone who drinks excessively and often to the point of being unable to control their behavior. A teetotaler, on the other hand, is someone who abstains from alcohol completely. Therefore, a drunkard is not someone who is a teetotaler. The other choices, such as pioneer and temperance, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk drawer | Knowledge: A moistener is typically used to moisten stamps or envelopes. Therefore, it makes sense for someone to keep a moistener in a place where they would commonly use stamps or envelopes; such as their desk drawer. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not typically associated with the use of moisteners.
soccer game | Knowledge: The sentence refers to people kicking a ball, which is a common activity in soccer. Fans typically watch soccer games at stadiums or other sporting venues. The other options may involve sports that also have balls, but they do not necessarily involve kicking the ball.
being dirty | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Brenda made a considerable effort to clean herself, which suggests that she disliked being dirty or unclean. The options "get messy," "cleaning," and "get dirty" are not correct because these actions are not being complained about. The only remaining option is "getting dirty," but this is in present tense which doesn't match the past tense of the sentence. Therefore, "being dirty" is the only logical choice.
shady spot | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard is trying to avoid the heat, which means it is likely looking for a cooler location. The options "sunny place" and "rocky areas" are both associated with heat and exposure to sunlight, so they are unlikely to be the correct answers. "Garden" and "dirt" do not provide any specific information that would suggest they are better locations for the lizard to rest. "Shady spot" is the most likely answer because it provides a cooler and more comfortable location for the lizard to rest.
sitting down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was tired from standing all day and decided to take a break. The option "sitting down" is the most logical choice as it directly relates to taking a break after standing for a long period of time. The other options may also refer to taking a break, but do not specifically address the act of sitting down on a bench.
play ball | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the children were engaging in some sort of physical activity in an outdoor location. The phrase "play ball" is often associated with outdoor sports such as baseball or soccer, which would be a likely activity for children to participate in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
climb | Knowledge: Mountains are commonly associated with activities such as climbing or hiking. However, these activities can be dangerous or impossible to do if the weather is not good. Mountain climbing requires clear visibility and stable ground conditions, and bad weather like rain or snow can make it difficult to climb safely. The other options (travel, go somewhere, ride bike, play frisbee) are more general and do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
passengers | Knowledge: The sentence refers to those who are flying in an airplane, which typically refers to individuals who are traveling from one destination to another. The term commonly used to describe these individuals is "passengers." The other choices are not accurate descriptions of individuals who are flying in an airplane.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the citizens are complaining about the condition of a roadway, which is something that falls under the responsibility of a city government. Neighborhoods and subdivisions may have their own local authorities, but they would not have the authority or resources to address major road repairs. The governor may have some influence over state-funded roadway projects, but this is unlikely to be the first point of contact for citizens with complaints about local infrastructure. The countryside is too broad a term to have any relevance to this sentence.
increased efficiency | Knowledge: The question is asking what using a computer may not cause for someone who is paralyzed, which implies that the answer is related to the limitations that paralysis imposes on the use of a computer. Paralysis typically affects the movement and control of the body, which can make it difficult to type, move the mouse, or use other computer peripherals. Therefore, options like carpal tunnel syndrome, medical bill, and eye strain may still be potential issues for someone who is paralyzed and uses a computer. In contrast, increased efficiency is also unlikely to be a factor, as someone who is paralyzed may not be able to work at the same pace as someone who has full use of their limbs. Therefore, pleasure is the most logical option, as someone who is paralyzed may not be able to derive enjoyment from using a computer in the same way as someone who is not.
prostitute | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the act of paying for someone to swallow semen is a transactional or commercial one. This is a common practice in the sex industry, especially with prostitutes who may offer additional services for an extra fee. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve the exchange of money or sexual services.
relax | Knowledge: The question implies that the person has finished their work, but it is not yet dark outside. This suggests that there is still some time left in the day, and it would not be appropriate to go to sleep. Rest and relaxing are similar, but rest usually implies some physical recovery while relax implies reducing stress or tension. Getting paid is not a typical response to finishing work, and the sentence doesn't mention anything about payment. Finally, the option "have fun" may be a good choice, but it is not specific enough to the situation mentioned in the question. The best answer would be to relax, as it is a common choice for when someone finishes work and wants to unwind before the end of the day.
brother's room | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the yoyo was stolen by a bratty young person, which suggests that it may have been taken by someone who had access to the yoyo and knew that it was valuable or desirable. The options "toy store," "toy shop," and "toy factory" are unlikely to have the stolen yoyo because they are not associated with the context of the sentence. "Own home" is also unlikely because the sentence suggests that the yoyo was stolen, which means it is not in the possession of the person who owns it. "Brother's room" is the most likely option because the bratty young person may have been a sibling or someone who had access to the owner's room.
get rich | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while the person's passion was to open a business, they also had a desire to become wealthy. This is supported by the use of the phrase "he'd be lying if he didn't," indicating that the desire for wealth is something the person is not admitting openly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either have a negative connotation (bankruptcy) or are too broad (live the dream, busy).
drinking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person dislikes having meetings while eating because he doesn't want to hear someone eat, which implies that the noise of drinking is also unwanted. It is therefore logical to assume that the correct answer is "drinking." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
learn together | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the teacher got all the children involved, which suggests a learning environment. The fact that they "learned together" also supports this idea of a group learning experience. The other options do not fit with the idea of a teacher getting children involved in a classroom setting.
hold water | Knowledge: A round glass is typically used for holding liquids, such as water or other beverages. The other options do not make sense in the context of a glass, as glassware is not typically associated with breaking easily, having many different colors, shattering, or holding doughnuts.
clerk | Knowledge: A ticket booth is a place where you buy tickets for events or transportation. Typically, the person who sells you the ticket is called the "clerk." The other options (venue, movie theater, museum, train station) all refer to locations where you might find a ticket booth, but the person you give money to would still be the clerk.
train station | Knowledge: A train station is a common mode of transportation for getting to a town. Michigan is a state, not a mode of transportation or a destination. Countryside, squirrel, and valley are not relevant options for getting to a town.
church | Knowledge: Churches often have candles as part of their religious rituals, particularly in the Christian faith. The use of candles is symbolic and can represent the presence of God, enlightenment, or remembrance of those who have passed away. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
cut trees deer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the absence of evergreens in woods is related to a specific activity, which is cutting trees for deer. Evergreens are a type of tree that can provide year-round food and cover for wildlife, so it's unlikely that they would be absent from undisturbed natural areas like tracts of undeveloped land or rural areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lamp | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were struggling to see which parts of the wall needed a second coat of paint because they did not have enough light. Therefore, it makes sense that they would plug in another light source to provide additional illumination. A lamp is a common household item used for lighting, so it is a likely choice in this context. The other options do not make sense in the given situation.
woman's hair | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker is using a hairpin on a female customer, which suggests that the hairpin is intended for use in styling or securing the customer's hair. The options "hair salon" and "barber shop" suggest places where one might use a hairpin, while "bathroom cabinet drawer" and "forehead" are unlikely locations for using a hairpin on someone else's hair.  Therefore, the correct answer is "woman's hair."
fridge  | Knowledge: The question is asking about a location where pictures are kept with magnets. The use of magnets suggests a surface that is metal or magnetic, such as a fridge. The other options (bedroom wall, newspaper, suitcase, attic) do not have a clear association with magnets or places where pictures are commonly kept with magnets.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a frozen pond near train tracks, which is a common sight in rural areas or the countryside. Additionally, playing hockey on frozen ponds is a popular pastime in Canada, which is known for its cold winters. Michigan and Alaska also have colder climates, but the sentence does not provide any specific information linking them to the activity described. The train station is mentioned only as a nearby landmark and is not directly related to the activity.
garbage | Knowledge: The word "disposable" suggests that the razor is intended to be thrown away after a single use, which means it would likely end up in the garbage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Supermarkets and hotel rooms have no clear connection to disposable razors, while a closet or medicine cabinet are not likely places for disposing of them.
raise crops | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer wants to increase his productivity, which is commonly associated with agriculture. Farmers grow crops to sell them or to use them to feed livestock, and the more crops they have, the more work they can get done. Planting cows and watering plants are not viable options as cows are animals that cannot be planted, and watering plants does not necessarily relate to productivity. Canning produce is a form of preservation and does not contribute to increasing the amount of work done. Rising early may be a good habit, but it alone will not necessarily lead to increased productivity in farming.
salad | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the meal being referred to contains carrots and leafy vegetables. While soup may contain some of these ingredients, salad is a more likely option since it is known for being composed of various leafy vegetables and often includes carrots as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
current | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the jellyfish was being moved by something in the water, and the word "pushed" indicates a force pushing the jellyfish. The most probable option is "current," as currents in the water can easily move jellyfishes along. The other options like "store," "book," "park," and "lake" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lend money | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is in need of financial assistance. Giving something or feeling sorry may not necessarily solve the problem, while crossing the street is irrelevant. Trusting God may be a personal belief but does not provide practical assistance. Lending money may be a possible solution to help the person get back on their feet, but this decision should be made after careful consideration of both parties' abilities to repay the loan.
bathroom | Knowledge: Toilet paper is commonly used in bathrooms for personal hygiene purposes, and is usually stored in a specific location within the bathroom, such as a toilet paper holder, shelf, or cabinet. The other options do not fit the context of the question and are unlikely places to find toilet paper in a house.
rooster | Knowledge: Roosters are necessary for hens to lay fertilized eggs, which can then hatch into chicks. If there is no rooster present, the hens will still lay unfertilized eggs, but they will not produce new chicks. Therefore, the presence of a rooster is important for sustained egg production. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical answer.
having fun | Knowledge: Going on vacation is often associated with taking a break from the routine of everyday life and engaging in enjoyable activities. While some people may experience stress while planning or travelling, "panic" and "debt" are generally not the main goals of a vacation. "Debate" may be applicable if a group is trying to decide on activities, but it is not a common goal of most individuals going on vacation. "Peace" may be a desirable outcome, but it does not necessarily capture the primary intention of going on vacation.
grocery store | Knowledge: A grocery store typically carries a variety of items, including frozen foods and party supplies, making it the most likely option for purchasing both in one stop. The other options, such as the refrigerator and freezer, are specific appliances for storing food rather than places to purchase them. The terms "fridge" and "supermarket" are sometimes used interchangeably with "grocery store," but they do not provide any extra information that would suggest they are better choices for purchasing frozen food and party supplies together.
tension | Knowledge: Intense competitions can create a sense of pressure and anxiety, which can lead to tension among the participants and the crowd. Tension refers to a feeling of being stretched tight, and it is often associated with emotional or psychological strain. Arguments and enemies are not necessarily related to competition, while sore muscles may be a physical sensation experienced by the participants, but not the crowd. Stress is a general term that may apply to any situation, so it does not indicate a specific aspect of the competition.
fashion show | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the women walking up and down a catwalk, which is a common feature of a fashion show. The cameras flashing also suggest that it is a public event where people are taking photos. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
sun themselves | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a dangerous outdoor activity for children. Sunning oneself can be dangerous for children because they may not be aware of the dangers of UV radiation from the sun, which can lead to skin cancer later in life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not typically associated with being dangerous outdoor activities for children.
hyperbolic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a talent for making stories more dramatic than they seem at first, which is a characteristic commonly associated with hyperbole - an exaggerated form of speech or writing. The other options do not convey the same sense of exaggeration or enhancement that hyperbole does.
lawn or Versailles | Knowledge: A courtyard is typically an outdoor area surrounded by buildings, often found in residential or institutional settings. The options "three headed dragon named Ralph," "asshole," and "Spain" do not have any clear connection to a courtyard. However, a lawn is a common feature in courtyards, making it a likely choice for the answer. Additionally, Versailles is a famous palace in France with extensive gardens and courtyards, making it an appropriate choice for the answer.
rest more | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is tired and sore, and has decided to stay in bed. The most logical reason for this is to rest and give his body time to recover. The choice "lazy" does not fit the context of the sentence, as the man is described as being tired and sore rather than simply choosing not to do anything. The choices "were sick," "to be sick," and "you're sick" all use improper grammar and are not suitable options.
table | Knowledge: The question suggests that the son has finished eating and needs to put away his paper plate. The most logical place for him to put it would be on a table, which is a common surface for eating and clearing dishes. The other options (his bedroom, dishwasher, cabinet, restaurant) do not make sense in the context of the question because they are not places where dishes are typically put after eating.
countryside | Knowledge: Beavers are typically found in natural aquatic habitats, such as rivers, streams, and lakes, which are commonly found in rural and wilderness areas like the countryside. While it is possible for beavers to be found in a zoo, the context of the question suggests that it is asking about where beavers can be found in the wild. The other options (middle of road, dictionary) are not suitable habitats for beavers. British Columbia may be a possible answer, but it is not clear whether the question is asking for a specific location or a general type of environment.
livingroom | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place where a piece of furniture can serve a dual purpose – as both a seating option and a bed. The living room is a common area where people entertain guests and need extra seating, so having a sofa bed in the living room would be a practical choice. The other options (garage, spare room, dining room) do not typically serve as primary living spaces where people would need both seating and a bed.
park | Knowledge: A public amphitheatre is a type of outdoor venue typically used for concerts, plays, and other performances. In a city, it is common to find public amphitheatres in parks, as they provide an ideal setting for outdoor events. Movie houses are indoor venues used for showing films, while Greece and Italy are countries known for their ancient amphitheatres but may not have public ones in a city. "Outside" is too general to be a correct answer.
have rest | Knowledge: The word "exhaustion" suggests that the pregnant woman is experiencing fatigue or tiredness, and therefore needs to rest. The option "run out of steam" is a colloquial phrase that is not a medical treatment, while "give birth" is not a likely treatment for exhaustion. "Sit down" is too general and does not convey the necessary level of rest that the woman needs, and "stay in bed" is a more specific and appropriate treatment for exhaustion during pregnancy. However, it may depend on the severity of the exhaustion and the advice of a healthcare professional.
indigestion | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that eating breakfast with specific food can prevent a certain condition, which is likely related to digestion since it is contrasted with "dirty dishes" and "being satisfied." Indigestion is a common digestive issue that can be caused by various factors including the types of food we eat. Therefore, it makes sense that someone could try to prevent indigestion by eating specific food for breakfast. The other options do not have a clear connection to preventing a digestive issue.
theater district | Knowledge: Box offices are generally located in areas where there are many performing venues, such as theaters and concert halls. The term "theater district" specifically refers to an area within a city that has many theaters and other performing arts venues, typically where Broadway shows are performed. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence or the presence of box offices.
department store | Knowledge: A frying pan is typically purchased at a department store, specifically in the cookware section. It is not something typically found in homes or storage areas like cupboards or cabinets. The stove is where you would use a frying pan, but not where you would obtain one.
apply for job | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a process that needs to be completed prior to beginning work, which is commonly applying for a job. Applying oneself or concentrating can be a personal preference or attribute, but they do not relate to the context of starting work. Showering and shaving may be necessary steps in personal grooming, but they are not essential tasks to begin work.
landfill | Knowledge: Garbage is brought to landfills by garbagemen. Landfills are designated areas where waste is disposed of and buried underground. Trashcans and dumpsters are containers used to temporarily hold garbage until it is picked up by garbagemen. Television and computer have no connection to the disposal of garbage.
appear in court | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge is presiding over a court case and needs to listen to testimony from individuals who are involved in the case. "Appear in court" is a common phrase used to describe being present for a court case, whether as a witness or defendant. "Go into court" and "in the jury" both suggest being inside the courtroom but do not necessarily imply giving testimony. "Go to church" and "believe" have no connection to the context of the sentence.
talking to god | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the faithful are engaging in an act of communication during their prayer, which is commonly associated with talking to god. Kneeling down may be a physical posture associated with prayer, but it does not necessarily imply communication with a deity. "Knell" is an uncommon verb that does not fit the context of the sentence, and "ask for help" is a possible motivation for prayer but does not describe the act itself. Therefore, "talking to god" is the most appropriate answer.
dirty dishes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children were in a rush to leave for school after eating breakfast. Since they left something behind, it is reasonable to assume that it was something related to their breakfast, such as dirty dishes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was happy with his job, despite his appearance and the nature of his duties. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a positive emotion or feeling that is associated with job satisfaction. French fries and hamburgers are both types of fast food, but they do not necessarily indicate any emotional state. Enjoyment would be a possible answer, but there is no clear indication that the man enjoyed his job for any reason other than getting to eat hamburgers. Nausea and gas are both negative physical reactions that are unlikely to be associated with job satisfaction.
answers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was trying to understand and solve a mathematical formula, and as they figured it out, they filled out something. Since the person was trying to think deeply about the formula, it is likely that the "something" they filled out were answers or solutions. The other options do not make sense in the given context - becoming distracted or wondering would not lead to filling out anything.
more rest | Knowledge: The mom is instructing her son to stay in bed, which would imply that he needs more rest. Therefore, the likely option is "more rest." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence particularly well - "rest more" is very similar to "more rest," but sounds slightly awkward and repetitive, while "you're sick" and "drink water" introduce new ideas that are not supported by the context of the sentence.
credit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned has not been paying their bills, which can lead to bad credit. Credit refers to a person's ability to borrow money or obtain goods or services on credit, and a bad credit score can make it difficult to get a loan or credit card approvals in the future. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a water spout that is impressive and is located at the center of something. Fountains are commonly known to have water spouts at their center and are often designed to be visually impressive, especially in larger public spaces or tourist attractions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
museum | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the old stuff could have value, which implies that it may be worth preserving or exhibiting. Museums are institutions that collect and display objects of historical, cultural, or artistic significance, and are often the best places to send valuable items for appraisal and potential display. The other options do not offer any obvious connection to preserving or exhibiting valuable objects.
cigarette | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason for continuing to smoke despite warnings, which suggests that the person is already aware of the risks and dangers associated with smoking. Therefore, the most likely reason would be addiction to cigarettes. The other options are inappropriate and insensitive, and do not provide a valid reason for continuing to smoke.
northern hemisphere | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in mountainous regions of North America and Eurasia. The other answer choices are unlikely to be correct, as marmots do not typically live in the southern hemisphere or in jungles, and Vancouver Island is not specifically known for its marmot populations.
having fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children were engaged in some kind of activity with educational materials. The option "having fun" is the most likely answer because it is common for children to engage in play as a way of learning and exploring their environment. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they do not relate to the idea of using educational materials.
cross ocean | Knowledge: The word "ocean" suggests that the question is related to larger bodies of water, and "cargo ships" may imply commercial or industrial activities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "cross ocean," as it is a common function of ships that are not specifically designed for carrying cargo. "Bottoming out" suggests running aground, which is unlikely for ships that are not designed for shallow waters. "Collide" is a negative outcome that is not necessarily specific to ships that are not cargo ships, and is not a common function. "Crossing a river" is unlikely for ships that are designed for the open ocean. "Carrying people" is a possibility, but not specific to ships that are not cargo ships.
deflation | Knowledge: Inflation is the increase in prices of goods and services over time. One tool for fighting inflation is deflation, which is the decrease in prices of goods and services over time. Deflation can help alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing the purchasing power of consumers, which can lead to increased demand for goods and services and ultimately lower prices. The other options do not relate to tools for fighting inflation.
All of the above choices are options for an adult to take in order to learn something new. | Knowledge: Each of the options listed are institutions or locations where adults can go to further their education and gain new knowledge. Depending on their specific interests and goals, an adult may choose to enroll in a college class or university program, visit a library to read and research, attend a school or classroom setting to gain hands-on experience, or pursue any combination of these options to achieve their desired level of learning.
arctic | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer relates to a place with very little human population, regardless of whether it is raining or not. The arctic is a sparsely populated region with extreme weather conditions, which would likely prevent people from living there. Seattle is a city with a relatively high population, while Disneyland is a popular tourist destination, both of which would have a significant number of people. The forest and weather options are too broad and do not provide enough context to determine whether they would have a low human population.
forward | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe placed the back of the painting against something (presumably a wall), meaning that the front of the painting would be visible. By definition, the front of a painting is referred to as the "forward" side. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When correct time comes | Knowledge: The question is asking for the specific time when Christmas occurs in Argentina. The answer "when correct time comes" suggests that there is no specific date given, but rather the holiday occurs on the traditional date that it always does (December 25th). The other options do not relate to the question of when Christmas occurs in Argentina.
museum of natural history | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mammoth being referred to is not real, which implies that it is a replica or a model of the animal. The most likely place to find such a model would be a museum of natural history, where they often have exhibits and displays of prehistoric animals. The other options relate to specific time periods or genres and do not necessarily imply the presence of models or replicas.
England | Knowledge: The word "churchyard" typically refers to a graveyard or burial ground surrounding a church, which is a common feature in English towns and villages. While churches and graveyards can be found in various locations, the use of the word "very famous" suggests that the location should be widely known and significant, which is often the case with historic English churches and churchyards. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ill health, heart attack, lung disease, death | Knowledge: Smoking is a well-known risk factor for a variety of health problems, including heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and stroke. Therefore, the choices that mention specific health problems are more likely to be correct. The option "pleasure" is incorrect because while smoking may provide a temporary feeling of pleasure or relaxation, it ultimately leads to negative health consequences.
hallway | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location for the light source should be within the home and specifically in a place where someone may trip. The most logical option is the hallway, which is a common pathway in a home and often has limited natural light sources. The other options, such as the street or sky, are located outside and not relevant to the context of the sentence. Flashlight and books could be a source of light, but not necessarily in the context of moving through one's home.
win | Knowledge: The word "conquer" suggests a sense of competition or battle, where one side must emerge victorious over the other. The option "win" directly relates to this idea of beating one's opponent and is the most logical choice. "Make fun of" is not a suitable option as it is not a strategy for defeating an opponent, and "best" and "compete" do not convey the same level of intensity as the word "conquer." "Total domination" is a possible option but is less commonly used and may not fit the context of the question.
monastic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was dissatisfied with the materialistic and consumerist aspects of secular life, indicating a desire for a simpler and more spiritual existence. This aligns with the concept of monastic life, which often involves living in a community and devoting oneself to prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices while eschewing material possessions and worldly pursuits. The other options do not fit as neatly with the context of the sentence, such as "eternal," which is too abstract and unspecific, and "married life," which implies a different kind of lifestyle altogether.
snow | Knowledge: Marmosets are small primates that are native to the rainforest regions of South America. They are adapted to living in warm and humid environments and cannot tolerate cold temperatures. Snow and mountains are associated with cold weather, and Colorado is a state known for its snowy winters. France does not have a particular association with either cold or warm weather, and therefore cannot be definitively eliminated as a possible answer. However, the rainforest is the natural habitat of marmosets, so it is unlikely that they would find it too cold to live there.
compare prices | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people struggle with something specific while at a shop. The option "compare prices" is the most likely answer as it is a common difficulty people have while shopping, especially if they are looking to save money or find the best deal. "Spending money" and "purchasing" are not necessarily difficult but may be related to financial constraints. "Gambling" and "having fun" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
arthritis | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that knitting can cause some sort of illness or condition in the hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects the joints, including those in the hands, and can be caused or worsened by repetitive movements such as those involved in knitting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "have fun" and "relaxation" seem especially unlikely given that the sentence is discussing a potential negative outcome of the activity. "Shredded hands" may seem plausible given that knitting can be tough on the skin of the fingertips, but it is not a recognized medical condition.
hungry | Knowledge: The question is asking about the reason for cooking dinner, and being hungry is a common reason for preparing a meal. The other options may also be true, but they do not provide a direct answer to the question.
heaven | Knowledge: In many cultures and traditions, wings are used as a symbol of transition or transformation, often representing a journey from one state to another. In this context, the most likely answer is heaven, which is often associated with the afterlife and a transition from mortal life to eternity. The other options, such as airplane, flapping, pilot, and Detroit, do not have any clear connection to this symbolic meaning of wings.
niece | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a family relationship where "he" is the uncle and "she" is his relative. The correct answer is the option that represents the female relative of an uncle, which is a niece. The other options are either not related to the context of the sentence or do not fit the family relationship described.
orchard | Knowledge: An orchard is a place where trees are grown specifically for their fruit or nut production, whereas the other options do not necessarily have any association with providing food. A yard may have trees that bear fruit or nuts, but it is not their primary purpose, and not all yards have fruit trees. A state park may have trees that produce food, but it is not their primary purpose and they may not be accessible for harvesting. A market is a place to buy food, not grow it. The surface of the earth refers to the entire planet and has no specific association with trees that provide food.
pantry | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the food needs to be kept chilled but there is no refrigerator. The pantry is a common place to store non-refrigerated food items in the kitchen. The other options do not have any connection to the context and are unlikely places to store food, especially without a refrigerator.
desk | Knowledge: The phrase "wee hours" is commonly associated with staying up late or working through the night, which suggests that John was working at a desk in his workspace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cleaning dirt off | Knowledge: The sentence implies that washing hands for a long time is done for a specific purpose. Using soap and cleaning dirt off are both common reasons for washing hands for an extended period of time. Thinking and sleeping do not make sense in this context and irritation does not necessarily require a long period of hand washing.
wooded areas | Knowledge: Foxes are known to be wild animals that inhabit wooded areas, as they provide cover and shelter for hunting and denning. Hen houses and chicken coops are places where foxes may attempt to prey on domesticated chickens, but they are not where foxes would typically be found in the wild. Paintings and electrical circuits have no relevance to the habitat of a fox.
bowling alley | Knowledge: Bowling alleys often provide scorecards and pencils for players to keep track of their scores throughout a game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of using pencils to keep score.
loft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is inspecting a type of housing that has a ceiling, which is commonly associated with lofts. Lofts are often converted spaces that were originally used for industrial or commercial purposes, and can have unique design features such as high ceilings that are worth inspecting. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
a tv screen | Knowledge: The question suggests that the gentleman referred to is not a real person, which implies that they may be a fictional character. The most likely place to see a fictional character that appears to be a gentleman is on a TV screen, since TV shows and movies often depict fictional characters in various roles. Church and big house both refer to physical locations that are unlikely to contain a non-real gentleman. The option tuxedo refers to an article of clothing, which is not a suitable answer to the question.
phone book | Knowledge: Phone books typically contain listings of people's names and their contact information, such as their phone number and address. If the goal is to find out how to contact a person with a certain name, a phone book would likely be the most helpful resource to consult. The other options may be useful in certain contexts but do not specifically relate to finding contact information for a person.
violence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting drunk can lead to something negative when people have disagreements. While any of the answer choices may be negative on their own, the phrase "when people have disagreements" hints at a specific outcome. Research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the likelihood of aggression and violent behavior, especially in the context of interpersonal conflicts. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "violence." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are less commonly associated with the effects of alcohol consumption.
open eyes | Knowledge: In order to watch a film, one must have their eyes open to be able to see the images on the screen. The other options do not directly relate to the act of watching a film, for example, going to movies is an action taken to watch a film, but it does not describe what one must do on their face. Similarly, wearing glasses, having eyes, or relaxing may facilitate one's ability to watch a film, but they are not necessary actions to perform in order to watch a film.
gaining knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is investing time in acquiring information about math equations. This implies that their primary objective is to seek knowledge about the subject matter, rather than to find a specific solution to a problem or to learn how to use the equations practically. Therefore, the correct answer would be "gaining knowledge". The other answer choices are either too narrow in scope or do not fit the context of the sentence.
dentist's office | Knowledge: Prescription mouthwash is a medical product that requires a prescription to purchase. It is typically designed to address specific oral health issues, such as gum disease or bad breath, and is only available through a healthcare provider. A dentist's office is the most likely option for obtaining prescription mouthwash, as dentists are trained to diagnose and treat oral health conditions. Optometrists deal with eye health, drug stores may sell over-the-counter mouthwash but not prescription varieties, and bathrooms and bottles are not suitable options for acquiring prescription mouthwash.
known about | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah believed her party was a surprise, but in reality, it was not. The phrase "entirely what" indicates that the correct answer will describe the nature of the party. Therefore, the answer must indicate that the party was not a surprise. Bland, predictable, and boring all describe unenjoyable qualities of a party, which is not the focus of the sentence. "Send flowers" is not related at all to the context of the sentence.
case | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to traveling with instruments, and the question is asking where the instruments are kept during such travel. The option "case" is the most logical because musical instruments are often transported in cases designed to protect them during travel. The other options do not have any clear connection to musical instruments or travel.
pantry | Knowledge: Canned goods are commonly stored in a pantry, which is a dedicated storage area for food items. A pantry typically has shelves for organizing canned goods, as well as other food items such as boxed items or dry goods. Cupboards, cabinets, drawers, and shelves can also be used for storing canned goods, but the best choice among the given options is pantry because it is specifically designed for food storage.
coffee cup | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is related to a visit to Starbucks, a popular coffee shop. The handle of a coffee cup is commonly held by people after they receive their coffee order, while the other options do not make sense in this context. "Gripping" could be a possible option, but it still doesn't fit the specific context of Starbucks. A "briefcase" or "frying pan" are unlikely options, as they are not typically associated with a visit to a coffee shop. "Carry object" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer.
office | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "manager" suggests that Jenny might be in a workplace environment, such as an office. Additionally, the need to dial 9 to get an outside line is a common requirement in many office phone systems. The other options, such as hospital, friend's house, hotel, and every U.S, don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dies | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to the end of a war. The most likely outcome in a war is death, either through natural causes or from being killed in battle. Going to jail or receiving punishment may happen during the war, but it is not necessary for the war to end. Recognizing their true oppressors may be a desirable outcome, but it does not necessarily mean the war will end.
cherish | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person has mixed feelings about pie: while they do not like it, it has a sentimental value to them because it reminds them of their wife. The word "cherish" means to hold dear or to treasure something, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
own bedroom | Knowledge: A grandfather clock is a large, tall, freestanding clock typically kept in a home or personal living space. It is not typically found in a desk or office building, and while it could be displayed in an exhibition hall, it is more commonly seen in a personal bedroom or living area of a house.
school | Knowledge: A ring binder is a commonly used organizational tool for students, as it allows them to keep multiple sheets of paper in one place and separate them by subject or topic. Schools often require students to have ring binders as part of their school supplies. The other options, such as a notebook or bookstore, do not necessarily suggest that a student would have a ring binder. An office or office supply store may have ring binders, but it is not specific to students.
elation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone might feel a certain way after spending time learning about a subject they're passionate about. "Passionate" typically means having strong feelings, emotions, and enthusiasm towards something, so it's likely that the individual would feel positive about their learning experience. "Advance" and "gain knowledge" may also be correct as they could be seen as positive outcomes, but "headache" is unlikely and "form opinions" could be either positive or negative.
train station | Knowledge: The mention of people with suitcases suggests that the location is likely a transportation hub. A ticket office at a hotel or opera house would not necessarily have people with suitcases. "End of line" could refer to a transportation hub, but without further context, it is too vague to be a likely answer. "City" is too broad of a category to infer any useful information. Therefore, the most likely answer is "train station."
hotel | Knowledge: Hotels often have bars and offer travel accommodations for guests, making them a good option for someone looking to travel and have access to bar service. The other options, such as trains or amusement parks, may not have bar service readily available or may not be as accommodating for travelers looking for bar service. A wedding or entertainment event may have a bar, but it may not necessarily involve travel or provide lodging accommodations.
getting tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating midday, and that consequence is feeling tired. This could be due to the body using energy to digest the food or because of a post-lunch dip in energy levels. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not match the known effects of eating midday.
new york city | Knowledge: The phrase "skyscrapers" refers to tall buildings, and New York City is known for having some of the most famous and iconic skyscrapers in the world, such as the Empire State Building and the One World Trade Center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
people will understand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is answering questions for a specific reason. The options "children will learn" and "teaching" are related to the profession of a teacher, but they do not explain why the teacher is answering questions in this particular situation. "Helping" is too vague, and could apply to any number of scenarios. "Embarrassment" is unlikely to be the reason why the teacher is answering questions. Therefore, the best option is "people will understand," as this aligns with the goal of effective communication and comprehension in an educational setting.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is experiencing physical and emotional discomfort and is in need of rest. Relaxation is the most appropriate choice as it addresses both her physical and emotional needs. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence. Adventure may lead to physical exertion and further fatigue, headache is a symptom of discomfort, deciding is not a solution to Jane's problem, and revelations are unrelated to the sentence.
restricted | Knowledge: The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, but the word "restricted" means limited or confined. If someone can only eat certain things, it means their diet is restricted, or limited to certain foods. This is a common term used in discussions of nutrition and dietary needs, and it makes sense in the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is looking to satisfy his craving for carrots, which are commonly sold in supermarkets. The other options do not make sense in this situation - an attic or cellar would not typically have carrots, a farmer's market may not be open at 9 PM, and a refrigerator is typically found in one's own home, not a destination to drive to.
feelings | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is something that all people have, except for sociopaths. The word "except" implies that sociopaths lack this trait, while everyone else possesses it. The options "cheeks," "parents," "muscles," and "common sense" do not fit this pattern, as they are not traits that sociopaths are known to lack. However, sociopaths are often characterized as lacking or having difficulty understanding and experiencing emotions or feelings, so this is likely the correct answer.
forest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys walking during autumn and specifically mentions her appreciation for the color of fallen leaves. The most logical place for her to take long walks in September that would allow her to see the changing colors of leaves would be a forest or wooded area. The other options, such as a roof or tree, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
honor  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker has negative feelings towards the King and his knights, but still holds them in high regard in some way. The choice "honor" would be the most fitting in this context because it implies that the speaker recognizes the importance or worthiness of the King and his knights, even if they do not necessarily like them. "Reverence," "admiration," and "respect" are also related to having positive or favorable feelings towards someone, which conflicts with the speaker's negative view in this sentence. "Kindness" does not fit the context of the sentence.
bedroom | Knowledge: Condoms are a form of contraceptive used during sexual activity to prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections. Therefore, it is most appropriate to use condoms in the context of sexual encounters, which commonly occur in a bedroom setting. The other options do not relate to the context of condom use, and some are inappropriate or nonsensical (e.g. dick, supermarket).
military service | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the use of a machine gun is associated with a specific field or profession. The options "quake 2" and "arsenal" are video game and weapon-related terms, respectively, and are not relevant to the context of the sentence. "In a" is too vague and does not provide any meaningful information. "Armory" is a location where weapons are stored, but it does not necessarily indicate the use of machine guns. "Military service" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the use of weapons, including machine guns.
go to market | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's lunch was ruined, and he needs to get more. Going to the market would be the most logical option to obtain more food. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence.
plant trees | Knowledge: A landscape gardener is someone who designs and creates outdoor spaces, including gardens and yards. Planting trees is a common activity for a landscape gardener, as they work to create a visually appealing and functional outdoor environment. Watering the lawn and plants is also important for maintaining the health and vibrancy of the outdoor space, but it is not necessarily a specific action that a landscape gardener is known for. Gardening roses is a specific type of activity that a gardener might engage in, but it is not necessarily what a landscape gardener is most commonly known for. Playing on the ground is not a task associated with any type of gardener.
zip up | Knowledge: The question refers to a common clothing item, trousers, and a specific part of it, the fly. The verb "unfastened" implies that the fly was previously closed, and therefore needs to be "fastened" or closed again. The options "do up," "tie up," and "button up" all suggest the use of buttons or ties to fasten the fly, but trousers typically have a zipper instead. Therefore, "zip up" is the correct answer. "Pick up" is not related to fastening clothing and doesn't make sense in this context.
detroit | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a car factory, and Detroit is famously known as "Motor City" due to its history as a major center for automobile manufacturing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the apple tree was located outside a car factory in Detroit. None of the other choices have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
understanding | Knowledge: The phrase "learning about the world from a shut in" implies that the person has limited access to the outside world and is likely to have a unique perspective. This experience can lead to a greater understanding of the world, as they may have to rely on other sources of information and have more time for reflection. Confusion, cynicism, and sadness are possible outcomes, but they are not necessarily tied to the context of the question. Enlightenment is also a possibility, but it is more commonly associated with spiritual or philosophical experiences, rather than being shut in.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the question is related to the storage of food cans, which are typically stored in a household setting. While some people may store cans in a pantry or cupboard, the most common place to store cans is in a refrigerator. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as supermarkets are primarily for purchasing food, recycling centers are for disposing of waste, and backpacks are not typically used for storing food cans.
warehouse | Knowledge: The description of the location contains several clues that suggest Joe works in a warehouse, such as the "stacks of small cardboard boxes" and the fact that the lids are removable, indicating that the contents are being stored and moved around. Additionally, warehouses are commonly associated with storage and sorting of goods, which matches the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit with the description provided.
wedding | Knowledge: Weddings are typically celebrated with a large crowd of people, made up of family, friends, and acquaintances of the couple. The other options do not typically involve large gatherings of people for the purpose of celebration. A bus stop is a place where people wait for transportation, a crowd is not a specific event, a convention is a professional gathering, and a supermarket is a place where people shop for groceries.
power  | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the politician's primary motive is not to actually fulfill their promises, but rather to gain power. The other choices may be related to the politician's goal in some way, but none of them capture the essence of what it means to make empty promises during a campaign. Power is often seen as the ultimate goal of many politicians, and this choice fits with the context of the sentence.
flush | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person finished using the toilet and then did something to it before leaving. The only logical option in this case is to flush the toilet, which is a common and necessary practice after using the restroom. The other options do not make sense in this context - "flushed" is in the past tense and the sentence is in the present tense, "refill" and "clear" do not fit with what someone would do in a bathroom and "smell bad" is not an action that anyone would take.
game | Knowledge: Playing fetch with a dog typically involves throwing an object, such as a ball or a frisbee, and having the dog retrieve it and return it to the human. This activity could be considered a game because it involves rules, competition, and an element of fun. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of playing fetch with a small dog.
inspiration | Knowledge: Remembering a deceased friend can often inspire people to live their lives to the fullest and appreciate the time they have with loved ones. It can also inspire people to make positive changes in their own lives or to carry on the legacy of their friend through acts of kindness or charity. While there may be moments of sadness and crying, a more lasting and positive outcome is commonly associated with inspiration rather than problems or trauma.
made | Knowledge: A chess set needs to be assembled or set up before it can be used to play chess. It typically consists of a board and 32 pieces (16 for each player), which need to be correctly placed on the board according to the rules of the game. The other options relate to the experience of playing chess (such as having fun or feeling satisfied) or the strategic aspects of the game, but they do not directly answer the question of what needs to happen before a chess set can be used.
supermarket | Knowledge: Peanut butter is a common grocery item that can typically be found in supermarkets, along with other food items. Pantries and cupboards are places where food items may be stored, but they do not necessarily indicate where peanut butter can be bought. The option "jar" is not a location, but rather a type of container commonly used for storing peanut butter.
discomfort | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the patient was recovering well but still had a long way to go, which suggests that they were experiencing some discomfort or pain. Additionally, the patient's explanation is in the context of chatting with friends, which makes it unlikely that they would be discussing glee, fun, or inspiration. Laughter could be a possible option, but it is not supported by the context of the sentence. Therefore, discomfort is the most appropriate choice.
conversation | Knowledge: The word "talking" suggests that the individuals are communicating with one another, which is commonly referred to as having a conversation. Gossip and communication may also involve talking, but they do not necessarily imply multiple people speaking to one another. Sore throat and dry mouth are physical ailments, and are not related to the context of the sentence.
in charge of project | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the employee's ambition is valued by their boss, which may lead to a promotion or increased responsibility. Being put "in charge of a project" is a natural progression for employees who demonstrate ambition and leadership potential. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pace yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running twenty six miles is a challenging task that requires careful planning and execution. One of the key factors in completing this task successfully is maintaining a steady pace throughout the run. This helps to conserve energy and prevent exhaustion, which can result in collapsing or needing to rest frequently. Sweat is a natural response to physical exertion and drinking water is important for hydration, but neither of these options specifically address the issue of pacing yourself during a long run.
on a tree | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monkey was in a place where there was water around it, which is often found in forest settings where streams, rivers or ponds are present. The option "on a tree" is the most likely choice as monkeys are known to climb and live in trees. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
seeing artifacts | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the setting is a museum, which typically features exhibits of various types. Paintings are only one type of exhibit that can be found in a museum. Therefore, the correct answer is seeing artifacts as it is the most likely choice that can encompass other exhibits like sculptures, historical objects, and other types of art. The other options may also be present in a museum setting, but they do not necessarily relate to what one is viewing.
cooties | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah believes boys have something negative or undesirable that makes them unworthy of being kissed. The option "cooties" is a common term used by children to refer to an imagined contagion or undesirable trait that is associated with the opposite gender. The other options, such as "disease" and "halitosis," suggest a more serious concern that might be outside the scope of what is being discussed in the sentence. "Sweet" and "arousal" are not related to the context of the sentence.
wall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hitting something is likely to cause broken glass in a car. Walls often are made of brick or concrete, which are hard materials that could damage a car upon impact. The other options, such as a field, bridge, bottom of sea, or street, do not typically involve structures that could cause broken glass in a car.
napster | Knowledge: Lars Ulrich is a member of the band Metallica, which famously sued Napster for copyright infringement in the early 2000s. Therefore, the sentence suggests that Lars Ulrich would not be pleased if someone were to borrow a song from Napster (a file-sharing service known for facilitating the sharing of copyrighted music without permission). The other options do not have any clear connection to Lars Ulrich or the context of the sentence.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the steak house is the best in a particular location, which is likely a smaller or more specific area than a country or a desert. The options of Japan and the United States are too broad, and the option of the desert does not make sense as a location for a steak house. Texas is known for its beef production and steak houses, but the more specific answer is that the steak house is the best in the town where the speaker comes from.
roulette wheel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you are able to choose multiple options, and that one of the options is a color. This is commonly associated with roulette wheels, where you can bet on multiple numbers and also on specific colors such as red or black. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
boredom | Knowledge: The phrase "someone without much to do" suggests that the person is not occupied or engaged in any activities, which can lead to feelings of boredom. The fact that they are driving indicates that they are looking for something to do or to pass the time. Enjoyment, moving, fatigue, and injuries do not necessarily provide a compelling reason for someone to keep driving without purpose.
travel agency | Knowledge: The question is asking about a type of booking office that would be used for planning a trip, which suggests that the office would be related to travel. Out of the given options, only a travel agency is directly associated with travel and trip planning. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as an airport is not an office, England and city are not specific types of booking offices, and a police station is not related to travel.
create art | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that inspiration is the starting point or foundation, and then something else is required to create something. The options "sew," "write," and "express" are too broad and do not necessarily require creativity to be successful. "Express yourself" is too vague and can encompass different forms of expression, including those that may not require creativity. "Create art" is a specific option that matches the context of the sentence and requires creativity to be successful.
countries | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the world is naturally divided into different regions, but humans have added an artificial layer of division by creating countries. This is a commonly recognized fact of human geography and political science. The other options, such as "universe" or "cake slices," do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
come home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the travelers were looking for a destination that was close and didn't require much money to get there, indicating that they may have been going back to their own home. The other options all involve transportation hubs that would likely require some distance and expense to reach, making them less likely choices.
circumspect | Knowledge: The question is asking about the trait that a person would be exhibiting by avoiding imprudent decisions. "Imprudent" means unwise or not showing good judgment, so the trait being described here is one of carefulness or wisdom. Among the answer choices, "circumspect" best fits this description, as it means being cautious and considering all possible consequences before making a decision. "Discreet" and "prudent" also carry connotations of carefulness or wisdom, but "circumspect" is the most precise answer. "Immaturity" and "reasonable" are not synonyms for carefulness or caution, so they can be eliminated as options.
getting full | Knowledge: When someone eats, their stomach begins to expand, sending signals to the brain to indicate that they are starting to feel full. As they continue to eat, the stomach continues to expand, and those signals become stronger, eventually leading to a feeling of fullness that prompts the person to stop eating. The other options, such as gaining weight or discomfort, may also be factors that influence someone's decision to stop eating, but they do not directly relate to the physical sensation of feeling full. Gas and satisfaction may also influence someone's decision to stop eating, but they are not necessarily the primary cause.
noise | Knowledge: The sentence implies that printing on a printer may produce some kind of noticeable sound or noise. This is true for most printers, which often make a distinct sound when printing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lose money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the outcome of the first opening of a business may not be successful, which means that the business may not make a profit. Therefore, the business may lose money during its initial stage of operation. The other options do not match the context of the sentence - making money, wealth, and getting rich all refer to profiting from the business, while grand opening refers to the launch event rather than the business itself.
air | Knowledge: A cloud is a visible mass of water droplets or ice crystals in the air. Therefore, it is logical to assume that clouds can be found in the air. The other choices may not necessarily relate to the location of a cloud, such as night or day, weather report or above rain. The atmosphere is a broad area that includes both air and outer space, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
shivering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is cooling off quickly after exercising hard, which may be because she is experiencing a sudden drop in body temperature. Shivering is a natural response to this, as it helps to generate heat and maintain body temperature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
american southwest | Knowledge: Horses are commonly found in the American Southwest, particularly in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, which have vast deserts and rugged terrain that are ideal for horseback riding. Canada, State Fair, and Central Park are not known for their deserts or horse populations, making them unlikely options for where one would find a horse in the desert.
injury | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that fencing is a sport, and like other sports, there is a risk of something. The options "pain" and "small cuts" may be common in sports, but they do not necessarily apply to fencing specifically. "Competition" is not a risk, but rather a component of the sport itself. "Puncture wound" is too specific and also implies injury. Therefore, "injury" is the most appropriate answer as it is a common risk in various sports, including fencing.
hands | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the wife started to worry when the man was setting a cup on a table, which suggests that something else was happening that alarmed her. The option "hands" is the most logical choice, as shaking hands can be a sign of nervousness or a medical condition. The other options, such as "breaking" or "coaster," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pantry | Knowledge: The context suggests that the lady bought multiple bags of chips and had her kids stuff them on shelves, which implies that she is storing the chips at home. The most likely place to store food items such as chips at home would be the pantry. The other options do not make sense in this context - a bar would not typically have shelves for storing chips, supermarket staff would be responsible for restocking shelves, and a motherboard is unrelated to the situation.
got injured | Knowledge: The word "crying" suggests that the baby is upset or in pain. The option "got injured" is the most likely reason for a baby to cry, as they may have been hurt or uncomfortable. The other options do not provide a clear reason for the baby's distress. "Too many moms" and "acting" are unlikely reasons, and "distraught" is too general to determine why the baby is upset.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The term "tentative agreement" suggests that the individual has come to some sort of agreement, although it may not be final or completely solidified. Therefore, it's likely that the person would feel some sense of relief or satisfaction that progress has been made towards a resolution. Uncertainty and compromise suggest that the person may still be unsure about the outcome, while relax and finished are too definitive and do not account for the tentative nature of the agreement.
relaxing | Knowledge: The sentence states that James loved to play violin in his spare time, implying that he did it for enjoyment and not as a formal practice or lesson. Additionally, the word "relaxing" suggests that playing the violin was a way for James to unwind and destress, which would not be the case if he found it difficult to tune or had to take lessons to improve. Therefore, "relaxing" is most likely the correct answer.
mountains | Knowledge: In general, bodies of water in mountainous areas tend to be colder and less populated than those in other regions. This means that a lake in the mountains is more likely to be warm (relative to other mountain lakes), but also relatively untouched by human activities such as swimming, boating, or fishing. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where a warm but untouched lake might be found.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pillowcase is already on a pillow, which would typically be located in a bedroom. The other options, such as "linen cupboard" and "linen closet," may be places where the pillowcase is stored or kept when not in use. "Allen key" is not related to the context of a pillow or bedroom.
pollution | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John didn't appreciate the smell of the city, suggesting that there might be some form of pollution that is causing the unpleasant odor. The fact that the city has many roads and a lot of traffic also implies that there might be a high level of pollution in the area due to emissions from vehicles. The other choices, such as happiness or death, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
church | Knowledge: Aisle and pew are terms commonly used in the context of churches, where pews are rows of benches used by the congregation for seating and the aisle is the central pathway between them. The other options do not have any clear connection to this context.
juice | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about a liquid that can be kept in a large container. Juice is a commonly packaged and sold liquid that often comes in large containers such as jugs or cartons. The other options - door, shed, supermarket, and cabinet - are all objects that are not typically associated with storing liquid.
sleep | Knowledge: The term "fatigue" usually refers to a feeling of extreme tiredness or exhaustion, which suggests that the best course of action for someone experiencing this would be to rest their body as thoroughly as possible. While sitting down or having a rest might offer some respite, it is unlikely to be sufficient for someone who is experiencing full-body fatigue. Lying on the floor might be more restful than sitting, but it is still not the same as getting a full night's sleep. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is sleeping.
person | Knowledge: The sentence describes an entrance hall where a host is standing inside. The word "host" refers to a person who is there to greet and welcome others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as a palace, school, yoda, or house wouldn't normally have a host greeting visitors in their entrance hall.
ore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a process where a refined mineral is obtained through some sort of collection and mining. The word "refined" implies that the mineral being discussed has been processed or purified in some way. The word "mining" further suggests that the mineral is being extracted from the ground. The only answer choice that fits this context is "ore," which is a mineral or rock that contains valuable minerals that can be mined and processed into a refined form. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
carpal tunnel syndrome | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence or risk associated with knitting for an extended period of time. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition caused by repetitive motions, and it can be a result of activities such as knitting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk drawer | Knowledge: A pen is a tool commonly used for writing and is usually stored in a place that is easily accessible when needed. The given choices include various locations, such as stores and classrooms, which are not places where one would typically store a pen. However, a desk drawer is a common place for office and school supplies to be stored, including pens. Therefore, the best choice is likely the desk drawer.
nutrition | Knowledge: Vegetables are known to be a good source of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential for maintaining good health. Therefore, people who eat vegetables are often looking to obtain the nutritional benefits that come with consuming them. While some of the other choices may be related to eating vegetables, such as preparing them or keeping one's mouth open, they do not address the main reason why people choose to eat vegetables in the first place.
recognition | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is seeking attention and approval from their father, which implies a desire for recognition. Winning a baseball game, which is an achievement, is often a source of recognition and praise, especially from parents. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a sense of validation or acknowledgement.
very quiet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that it is important to listen to the dialogue while watching a movie in a theater, which requires a quiet crowd. The options "understand," "able to hear," and "pay attention" are all related to the act of listening, but only "very quiet" directly addresses the need for a silent audience. "Shut up" is too informal and aggressive for the context and would not be appropriate in a polite setting like a movie theater.
being satisfied | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is eating breakfast because they are hungry, which implies that their goal is to satisfy their hunger. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. Heartburn is a possible negative consequence of eating breakfast, but it is not the goal. Weight gain, overeating, and gaining energy are all possible outcomes of eating breakfast, but they are not necessarily the person's goal.
sense of peace | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that even though Bill wasn't religious and didn't engage in praying himself, he recognized that Lilly was experiencing a certain feeling from it. The description of this feeling as a "sense of peace" suggests that Bill perceived her praying as having a calming effect on her. The other options (good feeling, relief, feel safer, wasted time) may be potential benefits or criticisms of praying, but they do not reflect the specific experience that Bill observed in Lilly.
province | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the country in question is wary of joining the union for fear that it will make them lose their current status. The word "province" implies that the country may feel that joining the union would reduce them to a subordinate position, as provinces are often seen as secondary to the country they belong to. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
dry skin | Knowledge: Taking a bath involves soaking in water for a prolonged period, which can lead to the loss of natural oils from the skin, resulting in dryness. While other options like drowning and rash are potential risks of bathing, they are not common occurrences. The use of water and wet skin are necessary consequences of taking a bath and do not constitute side effects.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The word "socks" suggests that Bill is looking for something related to clothing or footwear, which is sold in stores that specialize in those items. The options "paint," "bed," "bureau," and "suitcase" are unlikely to be associated with clothing or footwear. Therefore, "sporting goods store" is the most appropriate answer.
concert hall | Knowledge: A symphony is a type of musical composition typically performed by an orchestra, and these types of performances are usually held in concert halls. Movie theatres and circus tents are not typically used for classical music performances. While some theatre productions may feature live music, it is not common for symphonies to be performed in this setting. Gymnasiums are also an unlikely venue choice for symphony performances, as they lack the acoustics and seating capacity that concert halls offer.
nudity | Knowledge: The context suggests that John was embarrassed about something related to the hot spring, which indicates that the correct answer is likely to be something that is commonly associated with hot springs. In Japan, hot springs are often public and require nudity, which can be uncomfortable for some individuals. The other options such as cleanliness, other people, dry skin, or using soap do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backpack | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer will involve a location where a student can store books when they are not using them. Of the options given, a backpack is the most common and practical location for students to store their books while on-the-go or traveling between classes. A table or shelf might be used to temporarily hold books while studying, but they are not typically used for long-term storage. The floor and cabinet are also possible locations, but they are less common and not as convenient as a backpack.
mountain range | Knowledge: The use of the word "large" suggests that the rocks being referred to are likely significant in size. Mountains are known for having large rocks, while the other options do not necessarily have this association. The surface of the earth and the ground may have rocks, but they may not be large. A quarry is a man-made excavation site where rocks are extracted, but it is not necessarily known for having large rocks. The countryside is a broad term that does not necessarily have a strong association with rocks.
embarrassment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the situation of listening to your mother telling childhood stories to your date might cause a particular feeling. Embarrassment is a common feeling associated with situations where someone feels exposed or uncomfortable, especially when the stories being told may be embarrassing or personal. Learning, empathy, and anxiety do not connect as closely to this situation, while fatigue may be a feeling, but it does not fit the context of the sentence.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is receiving cooked potatoes from an employee, which is a scenario that is likely to occur in a restaurant or food service establishment. The other options do not make sense in this context - the bathroom and cellar are unlikely places to receive food, and "plate" is not a location. "Countryside" also does not make sense, as it does not provide any information about where the potatoes may have been cooked or served.
lower | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite John getting a raise, he also experienced a decrease in his rank or position. The word "lower" is the opposite of "higher," which would make sense in the context of losing rank. The other options, such as demotion or push down, have negative connotations and are not necessarily reflective of the overall tone of the sentence, which suggests a positive outcome despite the decrease in rank. Additionally, the option "go off strike" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
may fall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a potential consequence of making a mistake while skating. One common consequence of skating missteps is falling, which is closely related to the option "may fall." The other options, such as "having fun" and "flying to the moon," do not seem to fit the context of the sentence and are less likely to be the correct answer.
blunt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scythe was previously sharp, but by the end of the field it was no longer cutting effectively. This implies that the scythe has become blunt, which means that the cutting edge is no longer sharp or pointed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
underpants | Knowledge: The sentence uses the word "very bad" to describe the place where it would be undesirable to find a crab. The options such as Chesapeake Bay, Seychelles, fishing boat and cooking pot are all places or objects where one might expect to find crabs, but underpants is not a typical location for a crab. This implies that it would be very unpleasant for someone to discover a crab in their underpants.
drugstore | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John is walking down an aisle that has over the counter medication and assorted items such as toys, candy, and whatnot. This suggests that John is in a store that primarily sells medication, such as a drugstore. The other options are less likely because they do not specialize in selling medication, and in the case of a gas station, they typically only have a small selection of snacks and beverages, not a full aisle of over the counter medication.
belong to | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally went to the wrong house while she was drunk, implying that she was intending to visit someone specific. The option "belong to" suggests that the house belongs to someone who is Sally's neighbor, which would explain why she was intending to visit them. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
person's head | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James shaving resulted in a lot of hair being left behind, which is commonly associated with shaving one's head. The other options - arm, floor, sink, moustache - do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
australian outback | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is hoping to find a live koala in its natural habitat rather than in a zoo, indicating that they are planning to go on a wildlife adventure. The Australian outback is a vast and remote area that is known for its diverse range of flora and fauna, including koalas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and none of them are typical habitats for koalas.
floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the token was discarded in a careless manner, which would make it likely to end up on the floor rather than in a pocket, ashtray, or coin collection. The mention of a slot machine could be a potential red herring, as it could suggest that the token ended up in the machine, but the sentence explicitly states that it was tossed aside.
regret | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person committed murder but did so in self defense, meaning they may have had no other choice to protect themselves. However, the use of the word "still" suggests that the person feels some negative emotion about what they did, indicating regret. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not reflect the potential emotional response of someone who has committed murder.
fun | Knowledge: Playing games is generally considered a leisure activity that people engage in for enjoyment and entertainment. The option "fun" best describes this rationale for playing games as it aligns with the general understanding of why people choose to play games. The options "keep score," "try to win," and "attempt to win" are related to playing games, but are more specific reasons for playing certain types of games (e.g., competitive games) rather than the general rationale for playing games. "Bored" may be a reason some people play games, but it is not the primary or most common reason.
hide | Knowledge: The word "try to escape" suggests that the marmot is trying to avoid being caught or seen. The option "hide" is the most logical answer because it would allow the marmot to remain concealed from the person looking for it. The other options do not provide a specific action that could help the marmot evade capture.
latency | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John experiences slower internet searches as a result of his router going to sleep. The term "latency" refers to the time delay between a request and a response in a computer network, which can cause slower internet speeds. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backpack | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for a hike and needs to know where to put the rope. The option "backpack" makes the most sense as it is a common place to store equipment while hiking. The other options, such as "swimming pool" and "boat," do not have any obvious connection to hiking and the option "lay down" doesn't make sense in terms of storing equipment. The option "lower person" is also unlikely as there is no context to suggest that someone else will be joining the hike.
fundamental | Knowledge: The word "trivial" suggests something that is unimportant or insignificant. Therefore, the answer choice that is least likely to be trivial would be one that is important or essential. The word "fundamental" means basic or essential, and is often used to describe core values or principles. Therefore, "fundamental" is the most likely correct answer choice in this context. The other answer choices have varying degrees of importance or significance, but do not necessarily convey a sense of essentiality.
country | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being referred to in the question is a leader who gets inaugurated. The most common type of leader who undergoes an inauguration ceremony is the leader of a country, usually a president or a prime minister. The other options, such as earth or pack, do not have any clear association with a leader who gets inaugurated.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Greg didn't have an interest in academics or history, so it's likely he wasn't engaged or entertained by the museum. The feeling of being crushed implies a negative emotion, and the option that best reflects that negative emotion is boredom. The other options (inspiration, enjoyment, itchiness, sore feet) do not accurately reflect the sentiment conveyed in the sentence.
native | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question used to have an accent due to being foreign, but now they no longer have one. The word "native" refers to someone who is born in a particular place or has lived there for a long time, and it makes sense in this context since the person is assumed to be a local without any accent. The other options do not fit well since they don't necessarily have anything to do with the idea of being a local or having no accent.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the corner shop is a central location in a small community where people gather and socialize. The word "epicenter" implies that this location is the heart of the community. The other options (England, Iowa, city, street corner) do not provide any context or information that would indicate they are the setting for a small community with a central gathering spot.
euphoria | Knowledge: Drinking with the intention to get drunk often leads to a feeling of euphoria, which is a sense of intense happiness, excitement, and well-being. The other options describe the negative consequences that can come after drinking, such as hangovers or loss of control, but do not describe the immediate physical experience of drinking with the intention of getting drunk.
bookstore | Knowledge: Giving something other than money to a clerk implies a transaction where a person would exchange something in lieu of payment. At a ticket booth, the exchange would likely be tickets or tokens for admission. At a hotel or shop, payment is typically made in cash or card, although in some circumstances a business may accept trade or bartering. At a post office, one would typically exchange goods for postage or other mailing services. A bookstore is the most likely option where a person may exchange a book or other item as part of a transaction.
case | Knowledge: Highlighters are commonly used in legal cases to emphasize important information in documents or transcripts. They are often used by lawyers or paralegals during the preparation and review of legal documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of using a highlighter in a legal case.
marriage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman is in a deep state of unhappiness and that she believes that murder is the only solution to end her suffering. The context implies that her problem is related to her relationship with her husband, making marriage the most appropriate option. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
arrive there | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is going somewhere and his parents want to know when he has arrived at his destination. The other options, such as fart, get lost, or go back, have no relevance to the context of the sentence. The option "meet" could also be a possibility, but the sentence indicates that the person is going somewhere, not meeting someone. So, arrive there is the correct answer.
come to conclusion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scientist was analyzing test results in order to arrive at a conclusion about a theory. To "come to a conclusion" means to reach a decision or belief about something, which is often the goal of scientific analysis. The other options, such as "learn new" or "think about," do not necessarily imply the same level of deliberate analysis or decision-making. "Ball stopped" and "look at" are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
attend school | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the items listed (pencils and paper) would be useful for a specific activity. The word "curiosity" suggests that this activity is one where learning or exploration is encouraged, which aligns with the idea of attending school. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
artificial breasts | Knowledge: Silicone is commonly used in the production of artificial breasts, and it can sometimes cause irritation if it gets stuck on the skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to silicone causing irritation when it gets stuck.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was in an IMAX theatre and the screen was so large that it felt like being outdoors. This eliminates options like monitor, movies, and home, which would not be associated with a large screen that makes you feel like you are outdoors. Drive-in movies do have large screens, but they are located outdoors, so this option does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is theatre.
northern climates | Knowledge: The word "marmot" provides a clue as to the type of animal being described. Marmots are a type of ground squirrel that is commonly found in mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. The other options do not match the natural habitat or geographic location of marmots.
playing | Knowledge: The question is asking about a business that is likely to have few cubicles, which suggests that the business is not primarily focused on individual workspaces. The option "playing" is the only one that doesn't involve a traditional workplace or office environment, and therefore is the most likely answer. The other options are all typical locations where cubicles might be found, such as banks, office buildings, or workplaces where dividing workspaces are necessary.
less sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Josh's normal routine involves staying up late, which means he may have difficulty adjusting to a nine to five job that requires him to wake up early. This could result in him getting less sleep than he's used to. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
close fitting | Knowledge: When a person is full, their stomach becomes distended, making their clothes feel tighter and more form-fitting. "Close fitting" describes the way clothing fits when it is snug against the body, which is likely to happen when a person is full. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
casino | Knowledge: Gambling is typically associated with casinos, where people can play a variety of games like poker, blackjack, and slot machines. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - a show, fairgrounds, buying lottery tickets, and going to a friend's house are not necessarily associated with gambling.
garment bag | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is not traveling, but still needs to store their clothing. Suitcases are typically used for travel and are not commonly used for storage in a home setting. Drawers and dressers are typically used for storing folded clothing, but may not be suitable for hanging a shirt. A dirty laundry basket is for clothing that has been worn and requires washing. A garment bag, on the other hand, is a specific type of bag designed for storing and transporting clothing, particularly those that need to be hung up like shirts.
enter college | Knowledge: Secondary education typically refers to high school or equivalent education. After completing this level of education, many individuals choose to continue their studies in higher education by entering college or university. Feeling lonely, crossing the street or passing exams are not related to secondary education specifically, while graduating from high school is synonymous with completing secondary education.
department store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking for both clothing and electronics, which are typically not found in the same type of store. However, department stores often carry a wide variety of products, including clothing and electronics, making them a likely option for someone seeking both items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
anxiety | Knowledge: The term "stage fright" is commonly used to describe the fear and anxiety that many people experience before and during a public speaking or performance event. This knowledge can help eliminate options like "ridiculous" and "happiness" which are not typically associated with this type of situation. The option "open sores" is completely unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. The remaining option, "different", does not provide enough information to determine whether it is correct or not, making "anxiety" the most likely correct answer.
question | Knowledge: The question is asking about a test that requires an "answer," suggesting that the test involves responding to specific prompts or questions. "Swear" and "wrong" are not typically associated with test-taking, while "problem" is too vague to be a good answer choice. "Question" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to the idea of answering prompts or queries.
fall down | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a building that is no longer needed. In general, if a building is not maintained or used, it will eventually deteriorate and collapse. This is because buildings are designed to withstand the weight and stresses of their intended use, and if they are left unoccupied and unmaintained, the structural integrity can be compromised. The other options do not make sense in this context - casting a shadow, facing north, or being a target are not necessarily related to a building's usefulness or condition, and weathering a storm could potentially damage a building, but it would not cause it to collapse entirely.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a waiter cleaning up a spilled soup bowl, which implies that the person who spilled it was dining at a restaurant. The other options (cabinet, apartment, dishwasher, washing machine) are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any relevant information to help choose the correct answer.
new laws | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone wants to bring about change in their society, which requires some kind of action from their government. The option "new laws" is the most logical choice as laws are often used to regulate society and bring about change. "Happiness for" is not clear in its meaning and does not relate to the context of the sentence. "Give up" and "acceptance" do not suggest any proactive measures for bringing about change. "Cultural revolution" may bring about change, but it is not necessarily something that the government can provide.
multitask | Knowledge: The term "multitask" suggests that the person would need at least two computers to perform several tasks simultaneously. This is because a single computer can only handle one task at a time efficiently. Sharing files, doing work, or doing arithmetic can all be done on a single computer, and would not require multiple devices. Costing money also does not make sense in this context, as it is not an action that can be performed using computers.
tropical forest | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the snake was found in a natural environment, specifically a cave. North of Texas is not typically associated with indoor or built environments like a bedroom or basement. "Ball stopped" does not make any sense in this context. Oklahoma is located south of Texas, so it is unlikely the snake would have been found there if it was specifically stated to be north of Texas. A tropical forest, however, is a type of natural environment where snakes are commonly found, and it is plausible that a cave in a tropical forest could be located north of Texas.
back yard | Knowledge: When a pet goes missing, the first place to look for it is usually in the surrounding area of the owner's home. The most common location for pets to wander off to is the back yard or porch as it is a familiar environment for the pet. The other options, like the road or neighbor's house, may also be searched later on, but the back yard is usually the first place to begin the search. The option 'farmyard' may not apply if the owner has no access to one.
high school band | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is a member of a musical ensemble, specifically one that includes young amateur musicians. The options "chef," "abc book," and "museum" do not fit this context at all. While "orchestra" is a type of ensemble, the fact that the sentence mentions a xylophone suggests that the group may be smaller and less formal than a full orchestra, making "high school band" the most likely choice.
creation of art | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the method being referred to is a way of expressing oneself while also creating an object of lasting beauty. This is commonly associated with the creation of art, as art is often seen as a form of self-expression and can produce beautiful objects that endure over time. The other options, such as being slapped or experiencing pain, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not commonly associated with creating objects of beauty.
sleeping | Knowledge: The question is asking about how one typically rest when laying down in a bed. "Sleeping" is the most appropriate answer because it is the most common activity people do when they lay down in bed to rest. The other choices - in motion, using energy, action, and rapidly - do not accurately describe the typical resting position or activity when laying down in a bed.
fall asleep | Knowledge: Resting when tired usually results in the individual falling asleep. This is because the body naturally tends to shut down and enter a state of sleep when it is tired in order to recuperate and rebuild energy. The other options, such as time passing or lying down, do not necessarily indicate that the individual will fall asleep. Snoring is also not always a given when someone falls asleep.
shopping center or city | Knowledge: Shopping centers and cities are both locations where multiple businesses or destinations are gathered in a relatively small area, leading to a higher demand for parking spaces. Airports may have multiple parking lots as well, but this is not always the case and the context of the question does not suggest that an airport is being referred to. Circuses often set up in temporary locations and would not typically have designated parking lots.
lumberyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the builder is looking for wood to build a new home, which is commonly purchased from a lumberyard. Lumberyards specialize in selling wood products for construction, such as dimensional lumber, plywood, and siding. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
movie | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the musician had a big break in the entertainment industry by playing their instrument for a soundtrack. This suggests that the musician has some proficiency and experience in composing or arranging music for visual media, such as a movie. The other options (magazine, case, concert hall, orchestra) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mean cruel | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that James was a mean person, which contradicts the options of generous, nice, friendly, and kindness. The only option that aligns with the description of James is mean cruel, indicating that he was not just mean but also cruel.
working | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the men had a lunch break, which implies that they were doing something before the break. The verb "resume" means to start again after a pause or interruption, so the correct answer must be an activity that was interrupted by the lunch break and then continued afterwards. Working is the most likely option, as it is a common activity that can be interrupted and resumed easily. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
water | Knowledge: A boat is a vessel designed to travel on water, so the correct answer must be a body of water. Harbors and lakes are specific locations where boats can be found, while sailing is the act of operating a boat on water. The ocean is a vast body of saltwater and is a type of water, but not all boats are meant to travel on the ocean. Therefore, the correct answer is water.
problem | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that agreeing with everyone can lead to getting caught in the middle of conflicting opinions or issues, which creates a difficult situation, i.e., a problem. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
old clock | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a wooden rod was used to wind up something that was freestanding, which indicates that it was likely a mechanical object that needed to be wound up manually. The only option that fits this criteria is "old clock", as clocks in the past often required winding by hand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
visiting friends | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is back in their hometown and planning to have fun, which implies that they have people there they know and want to spend time with. Out of the options given, "visiting friends" is the most logical choice as it aligns with the idea of returning to a place you are familiar with and catching up with old acquaintances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
affection | Knowledge: Dogs are social animals that crave attention and love from their owners. Providing affection, such as petting, cuddling, or playing, is important for their emotional wellbeing and happiness. While going outside and being walked are also essential for a dog's physical and mental health, guard houses and rolling over are not typically associated with a dog's happiness.
exchanging information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that chatting with friends about current events leads to something happening. One logical outcome of such an activity is that people exchange information and ideas with one another. The other options may also occur during such conversations, but they are not as directly related to the act of discussing current events with friends. Laughter may occur during any kind of social interaction, hope may be felt independently of conversation, feeling close to others may be a byproduct of any socializing, and social approval could be sought in a variety of contexts.
prison | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a local terrorist has committed a crime and would be apprehended by law enforcement. In most cases, terrorists are taken into custody and sent to prison to serve sentences for their actions. The other options such as airport, hijack planes, hotel, and Afghanistan are not logical or legal consequences for acts of terrorism.
learn language | Knowledge: The question is asking about how a foreign exchange student can navigate and communicate in a new country. Learning the language is a crucial step in achieving this, as it allows the student to communicate with locals, read signs and menus, and understand instructions. Doing mathematics, reading a book, answering a question, or beginning to study may be important tasks for a student in general, but they do not directly relate to the challenges of being a foreign exchange student.
light fire | Knowledge: Burning logs are often used to create a fire for warmth and/or cooking purposes while camping. The other options such as making breakfast, going swimming, packing or heading out for a hike do not have any clear connection to burning logs.
shop | Knowledge: A clerk is typically associated with working in a shop or store, where they assist customers with purchases and handle transactions. The other options do not involve buying goods or services directly from a clerk. Post offices often have clerks, but they handle mail and packages rather than retail sales. Hotels might have front desk staff or concierges, but they don't usually sell things directly to guests. Airports have checkpoints and ticket counters, but again, these employees don't typically act as clerks for retail transactions. Bookstores do have clerks, but the word "clerk" is more commonly associated with general retail or grocery stores.
office | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sarah was in a work setting or a place where an office would be located. Putting food in a trash can beside a desk is a common practice in office environments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
livingroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to staying warm while watching television. The most common place to watch television in a home is usually the livingroom, which is also where most people keep their blankets or comforters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
livingroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual is looking for a location to work on their needlepoint near their front door. The living room is often a central location in a home and may be near the front door. The other options, such as thread or an artscraft store, do not provide a location for the individual to work on their needlepoint. Sewing and frame may be related to needlepoint, but they do not provide a specific location for the individual to work.
submarine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has multiple "heads" that need to breathe air, but the air is not fresh. This seems to describe a submarine, which typically has multiple people on board who need to breathe air that has been recycled and may not be fresh. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
might awaken | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is experiencing a dream where he is falling, but it does not provide any information about what might happen when he hits the ground. However, the context implies that John is sleeping and experiencing a dream, rather than actually falling in real life. Therefore, the most likely outcome when he hits the ground in his dream is that he would wake up. The other options are either too extreme or not supported by the context of the sentence.
read book | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the housemate was bored with what the others were doing and decided to do something else. Among the choices, the most likely activity that he chose to do is reading a book, as it is a solitary and intellectually stimulating option that does not require the participation of others. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
front porch | Knowledge: The question is asking for a traditional place to have a rocking chair, which is commonly associated with sitting and relaxing outside on a front porch. The other options do not have a strong connection to the traditional use of a rocking chair. A parlor may have been traditional in the past, but is less common today. A rock concert would not be a traditional place for a rocking chair. An old folks home may have rocking chairs, but it is not necessarily a traditional place for them. A rocking chair in a child's room may be common, but it is not a traditional use of a rocking chair.
lake | Knowledge: The question is referencing the habitat of a jellyfish, which typically lives in bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and lakes. The options "book" and "store" do not make sense in the context of the question, and "forest" is unlikely because jellyfish require water to survive. "Current" is also a valid option, as jellyfish can survive in ocean currents, but the question specifically asks for a location where they can stay alive, not just move around.
Paris | Knowledge: The idea of a romantic vacation typically conjures up images of European cities, particularly Paris which is known for its romantic atmosphere. The mention of sitting at a cafe on the streets also supports this association as Paris is renowned for its cafe culture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
instruments | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to a dentist who has finished working on a patient's teeth and needs to put away his tools. The correct answer would therefore be "instruments," as this is the term commonly used for dental tools. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this context.
recreational center | Knowledge: Recreational centers often have sports facilities available to the general public, including tennis courts. Athletic clubs and country clubs are often exclusive to members and may require special fees or memberships. College campuses may have tennis courts, but they are primarily intended for use by students and faculty. A zoo would not typically have a tennis court.
soccer game | Knowledge: The use of cleats in grass typically indicates that a sporting event took place. The word "soccer" in the choice list indicates a strong possibility that this is what occurred, as soccer is a sport that is often played on grass and players often wear cleats. The other options, such as fairgrounds or playground, do not have the same connection to cleats and torn up grass.
sing songs | Knowledge: Musicals are a form of theater that usually involve singing and dancing. The sentence suggests that an actor in a musical does something related to the musical aspect of the performance. Singing songs is a common activity for actors in musicals, as it allows them to convey emotions and advance the storyline through music. The other options, such as branch out or wear costume, do not accurately describe what an actor in a musical typically does.
drink water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that horses need something to survive, and it specifically mentions that Joe cannot provide for them. The option "drink water" is something that all living organisms need to survive, so it is likely the correct answer. The other options are more specific to the movement or function of horses, but do not address their basic needs for survival.
tank | Knowledge: The question suggests that the pet jellyfish is kept in a specific location, which rules out options like Australia, movie, and shore. A Japanese restaurant may have jellyfish on the menu, but it is unlikely that they would be kept as pets. A tank is a common place to keep pet jellyfish, as they require a specific environment and care to survive. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be tank.
human body | Knowledge: The question implies that the missing organ is a biological one, and therefore, can only be obtained from another living organism. The option "black market" suggests an illegal and unethical way of obtaining organs, which is not a viable or recommended option. "Music store," "system," and "cathedral" have no connection to the context of the question.
fair trial | Knowledge: In the context of the sentence, the person being judged is likely in a legal setting where a fair trial is a basic right. A fair trial includes the right to a trial without undue delay, to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, to be informed of the charges, to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense, to be tried in one's presence, and to have legal representation. The other options are not related to the context of a legal trial.
lame | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not enjoy seeing the massive ball of yarn, which implies that he found it unimpressive or uninteresting. "Lame" is a word often used to describe something that is unimpressive or disappointing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
a blow | Knowledge: The question is asking for a cause of losing consciousness specifically related to the head. A blow to the head is a common cause of a concussion or other traumatic brain injury that can result in loss of consciousness. Coma and death are more severe outcomes that can occur as a result of a head injury, but they are not a direct cause of losing consciousness. Falling down could potentially result in a head injury, but it is not as specific as a blow to the head.
taking care | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the child was not receiving the care they needed, and the teacher took some action to address this. "Taking care" is the most appropriate choice, as it conveys the idea of providing for someone's well-being. "Regard" and "consideration" could be interpreted as showing concern for the child, but do not necessarily imply action to address their needs. "Assumed" and "notice" are not relevant to the situation in the sentence.
activity | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the children were participating in a game, which implies an activity. The sentence also suggests that the children were enjoying themselves, which supports the idea that the activity was fun. The other choices - effort, exercise, relaxing, and playing around - do not fit as well because they either do not directly relate to the act of playing a game or do not fit the context of the sentence.
desktop | Knowledge: A telephone is an electronic device that requires speakers or a headphone to hear the caller's voice. Desktops are devices used to access the Internet or run programs and do not have built-in speakers or headphones, so it is unlikely that you would hear a telephone while using a desktop. The other options, such as a house, friend's house, party, or hospital, are locations where telephones are commonly heard or expected to be present.
fidelity | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly refers to the infidelity of John's sound system, which suggests that he expected loyalty and faithfulness from it. The term "infidelity" is commonly used to describe a breach of trust or betrayal, which reinforces the idea that John felt let down by his sound system. The other options, such as ending a marriage or mean shooting, have no relevance to the context of the sentence.
entertained | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people enjoy various things, but the most common way they experience something is through television. It implies that people use television as a means of entertainment, which is often associated with watching shows, movies, or other content that is meant to engage and entertain the viewer. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence - eye strain and visual refer more to the physical effects of watching television, while laziness and distracted do not necessarily relate to the act of using television as a form of leisure.
airport | Knowledge: Airports are known for having long-term or overnight parking options for travelers who need to leave their cars behind while on a trip. A shopping center or business district may have a parking lot, but it is more likely that people will park there for short periods of time while they are running errands or attending meetings. A swimming pool and city may also have parking options, but there is no clear connection to leaving a car for an extended period of time.
japan | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cooking style of the unfamiliar steak house is not commonly found in Western cuisine. The options "Mexico," "Texas," and "New York" are all locations within the Western hemisphere and therefore their cuisine would not be unfamiliar to Western palettes. The option "ocean" is not a location and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the cooking style is most likely from a location outside of the Western hemisphere, which narrows down the options to Japan. Japanese cuisine is known for its unique and distinct flavors, and therefore it is likely that the cooking style of the steak house originated from Japan.
forward | Knowledge: The word "go forth" suggests a forward movement, and the phrase "drive the enemy" implies an aggressive action of pushing them in a certain direction. "Straightforth" is not a commonly used word and does not fit with the phrasing of the sentence. "Back and" and "reverse" imply a backward movement, which does not fit with the context of attacking the enemy. "Backwards" could be a possible answer but it is more natural to use "forward".
livingroom | Knowledge: Sofabeds are commonly used as a space-saving solution for guests staying overnight. Most people don't have a spare room that can be dedicated solely to guests, so a sofabed is often kept in a shared living space, such as a livingroom or sitting room. A one room apartment may not have enough space to accommodate a sofabed, and it would be uncommon to keep a sofabed in a bathroom.
garage | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the word "oil," suggesting that the container can is used for automotive purposes. The most likely location for such a container can would be the garage, where the car is usually parked and maintained. The other options, such as liquid, store, pantry, and gutter, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
funny | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker usually doesn't like Adam Sandler, so the fact that they found his latest movie surprising must mean that it was different from his usual style. The fact that the speaker found it funny suggests that the movie was a comedy, which is a genre Sandler is well-known for. The other options do not provide any insight into why the speaker found the movie surprising.
irritation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James strongly disliked waiting in line, which suggests that the experience was unpleasant or frustrating for him. The word "hated" also indicates a strong negative emotional reaction, which rules out the options of linearity and have to wait for as being too neutral. The option of long wait might also be a possibility, but irritation more specifically captures a negative emotional state. The option of anger is also too extreme and does not necessarily fit with the context of the sentence.
being able to use | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending time finding information on operating something leads to a desired outcome or achievement. The most logical option would be "being able to use" since finding information on how to operate something would equip the person with the necessary knowledge to properly use the item. "Know how to act" could be a possibility, but it is not as directly related to operating something. "Full capacity" and "solution to problem" are also not directly related to operating something, while "gaining knowledge" is too broad and does not specifically address the purpose of finding information on operating something.
theater | Knowledge: Plush seats are typically associated with comfort and luxury, making them a common feature in theaters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of plush seats.
detention | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that misbehaving while attending school could result in some form of punishment that occurs after school hours. Detention is a common form of punishment for misbehavior, where a student is required to stay after school and complete additional work or remain in a designated area. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as they do not suggest a form of punishment for misbehavior.
cool down | Knowledge: The question is asking for the reason people want to swim in the heat, and the context indicates that the heat is uncomfortable. Therefore, the most likely reason people want to swim is to cool down. The other options - wearing a bathing suit, having fun, or exercising - could also be reasons people swim, but they do not directly address the issue of being hot and needing to cool down. Additionally, "exercise" is listed twice, but it is not necessarily a reason people want to swim in the heat.
rebel | Knowledge: In the 1700s, America was still a British colony and tensions were growing between the colonists and the British government. Many American colonists who were Christian felt that Britain was not treating them fairly and sought to rebel against British rule. This led to the American Revolution, which ultimately resulted in America gaining independence from Britain. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rock | Knowledge: The sentence describes a situation where someone is outdoors and encounters a large, frightening bug that they need to smash. In this context, the most likely object to use as a tool for smashing a bug would be a rock, which is a hard and sturdy object commonly found outdoors. The other options, such as tree or rug, are unlikely to be useful in this situation.
learn | Knowledge: While watching TV can certainly provide a distraction or help someone fall asleep, the question specifically asks about a benefit one could gain. Watching TV can also provide an opportunity to learn new information or gain knowledge about a variety of topics, whether through educational programming or simply exposure to different perspectives and ideas. Therefore, the correct answer is "learn." The option "have TV" seems like it may be a possible benefit, but it is not a benefit FROM watching TV, but rather an access to watching TV. The option "sitting" may not be a benefit either, as it is not something that comes directly from watching TV, but rather a part of the experience of watching TV.
neighborhood  | Knowledge: The mention of children suggests that the location being described is likely a residential area where families live. The term "neighborhood" is often used to describe such areas and is therefore the most relevant choice. The other options, such as suburbs or countryside, may not necessarily imply the presence of children or a concern for their safety.
eat meat | Knowledge: The phrase "hot cats" is likely referring to felines, which are carnivorous animals that typically eat meat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of cats and their behavior.
carolina | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man referred to the state where he was from as something other than North Carolina, indicating that he used a shorter or more informal name for the state. The only option that fits this description is "carolina," as it is a nickname commonly used for both North Carolina and its neighboring state, South Carolina. The other options either do not describe North Carolina or do not fit the context of the sentence.
injury | Knowledge: The word "wiggling" suggests that the dog is moving around during grooming, which can increase the likelihood of injury. Grooming involves the use of sharp tools and potentially hot water, so it's important for the dog to remain still. Mistakes, being late, and beauty are not directly related to the potential consequences of a dog wiggling during grooming. Pain may be a possible consequence, but injury is the most specific and likely outcome.
fresh produce | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a preference for purchasing their food at a farmer's market rather than a grocery store. This implies that they prioritize the freshness and quality of the produce they are purchasing, which is a common characteristic of farmer's markets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
towns | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location of small city halls, which implies that they are not located in large cities like Detroit or in specific buildings like an opera house. The word "small" also suggests that these city halls are not located in busy commercial areas like downtown, but rather in smaller communities such as towns. The option "court" may seem plausible, but it does not fit the context of the question as it refers to a specific type of building rather than a general location.
ground and water | Knowledge: Bacteria is commonly found in soil, sediment, and water, making options "ground" and "water" the most likely correct choices. Bacteria can also be found in other environments, such as the human gut or in a petri dish (if deliberately grown), but these options are less likely based on the context of the question. "Lake" may be a possible choice, but it is less specific than "water." "Toilet bowl" is unlikely, as it is not a natural environment for bacteria.
parade | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the decoration of the horse is related to an event or spectacle it is participating in. A parade is a common event where horses are often decorated with costumes and ornaments, which could explain why the horse in question was decorated. The other options do not provide a clear context for the decoration of the horse.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The question suggests that a long session of procreating may have negative consequences. Since procreating involves physical activity, it is likely to cause exhaustion, especially if it is prolonged. The other options are either too general (having children, reproduction) or don't fit the context of the sentence (feeling good, overpopulation).
backpack | Knowledge: Assuming that the individual will be traveling to another building, they will need to carry the scissors with them. Out of the given choices, a backpack is the most suitable option as it is portable and can easily be taken to another building. A haversack or cabinet may be stationary in one location, a desk may not be practical to carry around, and a house is too vague and may not be accessible or relevant to the situation.
Canada | Knowledge: The use of English and French on signs is a common characteristic of Canada, which is a bilingual country. This suggests that the travelers had likely crossed into Canada from an English-speaking part of the country and were now in a region where both English and French are commonly used. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
getting tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children had been playing for a while, which implies that they may start feeling exhausted. The option "getting tired" seems to be the most appropriate choice for this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Fights and competitiveness are not a natural outcome of playing, and learning is not mentioned in the sentence. Having fun might be a possible answer, but it does not capture the physical aspect suggested by the "playing" verb.
recorder | Knowledge: The sentence implies that something needs to be recorded, which is typically done using a device known as a recorder. A recorder is designed to capture audio or video, making it a suitable option for recording lectures, meetings, or interviews. The other options, such as tape or documentation of facts, are less likely to be used in modern times due to advancements in technology. Writing on paper is also a valid option, but it may not be practical in all situations. A spell checker is a digital tool used to check spelling errors, which is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
There is not enough information to determine the correct answer.
fence | Knowledge: The question is asking for a method to keep animals out of a garden, which suggests the need for a physical barrier. A fence is a common solution to this problem and is often used to enclose gardens and keep animals from accessing the area. The other options do not provide a practical solution for keeping animals out of a garden.
go to movies  | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the person is asking about how to watch a film before it is available on video, which means they are looking for a screening of the film in a movie theater. The option "go to movies" is the only one that directly addresses the question and is a common and well-established way of watching films before they are released on video. The other options do not provide any relevant information or are not practical solutions.
side with | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you are in a social setting with friends and that you have agreed with one of them while disagreeing with another. The phrase "side with" is commonly used to indicate that you are taking a particular person's side in an argument or discussion. The other options, such as "keep secrets" or "lying," do not fit the context of the sentence and are not relevant to the situation described.
condemn or condone | Knowledge: The word "judge" often implies a moral evaluation of a person's behavior or character. When we judge someone, we tend to either condemn or condone their actions based on our own values and beliefs. The other options, such as "gathering information" or "gathering facts," may be steps we take before making a judgment, but do not necessarily describe the act of judging itself. "Alienate" and "talk about them" are not directly related to the act of judging.
decay | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wallpaper is in a state of deterioration or decline, which is commonly associated with decay. Wet and damp conditions can lead to dampness, mold, and decay in many materials, including wallpaper. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they describe actions that would worsen or remove the wallpaper, rather than describe its current state.
big city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the train stations being referred to are large, which implies that they are located in areas with high population density and significant transportation needs. "Big city" is a logical choice as train stations in large urban centers like New York, Tokyo, and London are likely to be the largest ones. The other options, such as an ocean or the downtown area, do not make sense in the context of train stations.
backache | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman is concerned about something that might happen during a long drive, which could exacerbate an existing physical condition. Of the choices given, "backache" is the most likely to be aggravated by sitting for an extended period of time in a car. The other options (Michigan, car crash, automobile accidents, getting tired) do not relate to a specific physical condition or concern.
store | Knowledge: Nails are typically sold in hardware or home improvement stores, making "store" the most likely answer. Supermarkets typically do not sell nails, and jars, containers, and cabinets are unlikely places to find nails unless they were already stored there.
the ground | Knowledge: This question asks for the location where apple trees drop their fruit, which is commonly known to be on the ground. Apple trees are known to drop their fruit when it is ripe and ready for harvesting or consumption. The other options, such as outside, park, and Uzbekistan, do not have any clear relevance to the context of the question.
cruet | Knowledge: A cruet is a container often used for oils, dressings, and other liquid condiments, including lipids like oil or butter. A saltshaker is commonly used alongside a cruet on a dining table or in a kitchen setting to season these condiments. The other options (kitchen cupboard, cabinet, teaspoon, table setting) do not have any direct connection to the use of a saltshaker in relation to lipids.
spain | Knowledge: The sentence mentions bulls, which is a common cultural element associated with Spain. Spain is known for its bullfighting tradition and has many bullrings throughout the country where people gather to watch the spectacle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
swamp | Knowledge: The word "noxious" suggests something harmful or poisonous, which would not be associated with perfume, carafes, fountains, or oceans. A swamp, however, is often characterized as containing stagnant water that can be polluted and noxious.
shopping cart | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is getting food, which implies that they are likely in a grocery store or market. In such a setting, a tote bag would typically be placed in a shopping cart to carry items. The other options, such as between two legs or in a house, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
wooden | Knowledge: Hammers are traditionally made with a metal head and a wooden handle. The wooden handle provides a comfortable grip for the user and helps to absorb the shock of the striking force. Other materials like plastic, stone, or soft materials would not provide the same durability or practicality as a wooden handle. "Toolbox" is not a material and doesn't make sense in the context of the question.
go for haircut | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is overly concerned about their appearance in relation to a specific date. Going for a haircut would be a logical action to improve one's appearance for the date. The other options may also be related to improving one's appearance, but going for a haircut specifically addresses the concern of the person putting too much stock in the date.
river bed or creek bed | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the individuals were skipping stones, which typically involves finding flat, smooth stones to throw across a body of water. The options driveway and gallbladder have no connection to this context. Quarry could potentially be a source of stones, but it is unlikely that the individuals would be skipping stones there. Therefore, the most logical options are river bed or creek bed, as these are natural locations where one might find stones suitable for skipping.
live in poverty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unable to afford their home, which implies that they are facing financial difficulties. Living in poverty is a common reason for being unable to afford a home, and is therefore the most likely answer. Schizophrenia and deception do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, while bad feelings are not a specific enough reason for not being able to afford a home. Wealth is the opposite of living in poverty, and is therefore not a viable answer.
orchestra | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friend is a professional musician who earns a living playing trumpet. Among the choices, an orchestra is the most likely place for a professional trumpet player to work as it typically has a full range of brass instruments, including trumpets, and performs a wide variety of music genres. A music shop is unlikely to provide enough income for a professional musician, and a brass band or high school band may not have enough budget to hire a full-time trumpeter.
Rome | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a stadium where men once fought with spears, which is a reference to ancient Rome's Colosseum where gladiators fought. Rome is the only option that is historically associated with this type of activity, making it the correct choice. The other options are not connected to any historical context of men fighting with spears in a stadium.
impatience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that waiting in a queue for a long time can lead to a feeling of impatience, which is a common response to prolonged waiting. The other options also relate to waiting but do not necessarily reflect the negative emotions that can result from waiting for an extended period of time. "Will have to wait" suggests acceptance of the situation, "daydreaming" indicates a distraction from the situation, and "angry" implies a stronger emotional reaction than just impatience.
intertidal zone | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about the location of anemones off the eastern U.S., suggesting that they can be found in a certain habitat. The options "game preserve," "South Pacific," and "sea water" are not specific to the eastern U.S. region, so they can be eliminated. Anemones are known to live in both freshwater and saltwater environments, but the option "interidal zone" refers specifically to the area between high and low tide levels, where anemones are commonly found. The option "Atlantic Ocean" is geographically relevant and could be a slightly tempting option, but it is not as specific as the intertidal zone, which is the correct answer.
older generation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the uncle is the eldest and the closest living connection to something, and that the stories he tells are enjoyable to the person/people listening. The option "older generation" best fits this context, as the uncle is likely the eldest in his family and is therefore the closest living connection to the older generation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The correct spelling of "aunt's house" should also be noted, as it is incorrect in one of the options.
not listening | Knowledge: The sentence implies that talking to someone would be pointless if they are not paying attention or actively listening. The other choices, such as dry mouth or whispering, do not necessarily indicate someone is not receptive to conversation, and eye contact can even suggest engagement. Only the choice of not listening aligns with the sentiment expressed in the sentence.
southern hemisphere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason for the opposite seasonal patterns of South America and North America is due to their location. The fact that South America is experiencing winter when North America is experiencing summer implies that South America is located in the opposite hemisphere to North America. The southern hemisphere refers to the half of the Earth that is south of the equator, which includes South America. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the location of South America.
frightened | Knowledge: The question asks for the emotion that a person with courage is not likely to feel in a surprising situation. Courage is often associated with bravery and fearlessness, suggesting that the person is not easily scared or frightened. The other choices are emotions that are commonly associated with surprising situations, such as shock or nervousness. Humor, while not necessarily an emotion, is also not related to the context of the question.
humiliate | Knowledge: To dignify someone means to show them respect and honor, while to humiliate someone means to embarrass, shame or degrade them, which is the opposite of dignifying someone. Mortify, demean, and shame are also negative actions that can be considered the opposite of dignifying someone, but humiliate directly conveys the opposite meaning in this context.
injury | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that could prevent someone from staying healthy, which suggests a negative factor. Options like "live long" and "happiness" are positive factors and don't fit the context of the question. "Sadness" could contribute to poor mental health, but not necessarily physical health. "Long life" is not an obstacle to staying healthy, but rather a desired outcome. "Injury," on the other hand, is a clear factor that could prevent someone from maintaining good physical health. It could lead to restricted movement, chronic pain, and other health complications. Therefore, "injury" is the correct answer.
body | Knowledge: The question is asking what skin covers, which suggests that the answer will be a noun that describes a physical object that can be covered by skin. The option "body" is the most logical and commonly known answer, as skin covers the entire surface of the human body. The other options do not make sense in the context of skin covering something.
set table | Knowledge: The context of the question is related to learning about dining etiquette. Learning to set the table is a basic but important aspect of dining etiquette that children can learn early on. The other options mentioned are unrelated to learning dining etiquette, such as going to the wrong house, reading a book or watching television, or sunning oneself.
making music | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person playing the violin is doing so in the hopes of recording their music. This suggests that the person is interested in creating music, rather than simply practicing or performing for fun. Therefore, the correct answer is "making music". The other options, such as "calluses" and "playing wrong note", are not related to the goal of wanting to record music, and "audition" and "read music" could be related, but do not match the specific context of the sentence.
play games | Knowledge: The other options involve relatively passive activities that may not stimulate much engagement or interaction, which could lead to boredom. Playing games, on the other hand, typically involves active participation, strategy, and creativity, which can all be engaging and enjoyable.
peacework | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the country experienced a period of peace, which suggests that some effort or action was taken to bring about this state of calm. The term "peacework" is a commonly used phrase to describe intentional efforts to promote peace, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "war" or "violent," would not be likely to result in a period of peace. "Happened" and "trying" are vague and do not provide a clear explanation for how the period of peace was achieved.
prepare | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy is grooming himself to look good for the dance, but he can't find his comb. Therefore, he rushes to the store to "prepare" himself by buying a comb. This makes the most sense in the context of getting ready for an event. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
ground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the blower is being used to remove snow, which is typically found on the ground. The other options (Canada, mountains, surface of Earth, Yukon) are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any clues as to what the blower might be used for.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence states that cows were lost in the city and didn't enjoy the noise, indicating that they were out of their natural environment. Cows are typically associated with rural areas, such as farms and the countryside, where they have more space to roam and are surrounded by familiar sights and sounds. The other options are not directly related to cows or their natural environment.
fraternity house | Knowledge: The word "sorority" suggests that the two friends are part of a female Greek organization on a college campus. In this context, it is likely that the "fraternity house" option is the correct answer as it is a common location for college parties and drinking. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, as a wedding, friend's house, and school are not typically associated with Greek life partying. While a bar could be a possibility, the mention of a fraternity house suggests a more specific location.
flight school | Knowledge: The presence of wings on a helmet likely refers to a symbol commonly used to represent pilots or aviators. This suggests that the person who wore the helmet may have been a trainee or a graduate of a flight school, where they would have learned how to fly planes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
under ground | Knowledge: An excavation site is a place where archaeologists or construction workers dig into the ground to uncover artifacts, fossils, or other buried materials. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the fact that the site is located under the ground level. "Under ground" is the only option that accurately describes the physical location of an excavation site. The other choices either refer to different types of locations (e.g. desert) or do not accurately reflect the fact that an excavation site is located beneath the surface (e.g. work area or working ground).
closet | Knowledge: Basements are typically associated with larger spaces, but the sentence suggests that there are some basements that are small. Of the options provided, the only one that commonly has small spaces is a closet. Churches, office buildings, and art galleries are all typically larger spaces, while owning a house does not provide any context for the size of the basement.
feel special | Knowledge: Birthdays are typically associated with celebrations and making someone feel special. It is a day to acknowledge and celebrate the person's existence and accomplishments, so the correct answer is "feel special." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The meeting room | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the alcoholic was attending a meeting where alcohol was not permitted. Therefore, they likely brought their flask with them to the meeting room. The other options (science lab, laboratory, coat pocket, chemistry lab) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sensible | Knowledge: When selecting items for a baby, safety and comfort are key factors. Soft items are typically safer for a baby because they are less likely to cause injury or harm. Sensible is the best option because it is practical and reasonable, and soft items are generally considered sensible choices for infants. The other listed options are not appropriate for a baby's needs and are not related to the requirements for an infant's safety and comfort.
briefcase | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the business man had a meeting that required him to bring a fancy leather item with him (most likely for a professional appearance). The fact that his small child got marker on it implies that it was something that could easily be accessed by a child, which rules out options such as a drawer or desk. Of the remaining options, "briefcase" is the most commonly associated with a professional meeting setting. "Medium" and "office supply store" do not make any sense in the context of the sentence.
not profitable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the decision to give up on the goal of gaining more land was motivated by financial considerations, specifically that the endeavor was not profitable. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Going to war, pride, higher taxes, and more responsibility may all be reasons to give up on a goal, but none of them are directly supported by the information given in the sentence.
mountain  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the general is looking for a hill to survey the battlefield. The word "only" implies that there is only one hill in the area that will provide a vantage point for the general. A mountain is a larger and more imposing landform than a hill and would provide a more strategic and commanding position. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they either have no connection to the landscape or are contradictory to the desired objective.
shop | Knowledge: The options "school," "space shuttle," "trunk," and "stalk" are not logical places to obtain a radio. "Shop" is the only option that makes sense, as radios are commonly sold in stores.
fabric store | Knowledge: The sentence specifies that the person is looking to make clothing out of tweed, which is a type of fabric. Therefore, it makes sense to look for a fabric store where they sell a variety of fabrics, including tweed. The other options, such as clothing stores or Eddie Bauer, may sell clothing made out of tweed, but they may not have the specific fabric available for purchase. Additionally, buying online may be an option, but it may be harder to confirm the quality and texture of the fabric without seeing it in person.
church | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the installers were moving benches and installing new carpet, which is a common task in churches where seating arrangements are often fixed and carpets may need to be replaced due to wear and tear. The options such as office, building, playground, and bowling alley do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they may not necessarily have fixed seating arrangements or require carpet installation.
anger | Knowledge: Anger is often associated with negative consequences, such as causing harm to others either verbally or physically. Expressing anger can lead to arguments or fights, hurting relationships with others, and ultimately causing pain to both the person expressing their anger and the people they interact with. On the other hand, the other choices such as happiness, tears, and suffering are not inherently harmful to others. Punishment may cause harm, but it is not an emotion.
gain insight | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James spent time reflecting on what he had learned, which suggests that he was looking to gain a deeper understanding or insight into the subject matter. The other options do not align with the purpose of reflection or contemplation.
It depends on the specific context of the question.  |  | If the question is asking about the primary function of a gardener, the most likely answer would be "manicure the lawn." This typically involves mowing, edging, and trimming the grass to keep it looking neat and tidy.  |  | If the question is asking about the activities a gardener might perform, the answer could be any of the choices listed. Gardeners may be responsible for maintaining lawns, tending to flower beds, watering plants, cultivating vegetables or herbs, and more. The specific tasks assigned to a gardener may vary depending on the needs of the client or employer.
bus terminal | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is working in public transportation and has come across a locked door. This could be something that they encounter at a bus terminal, where there may be various rooms or areas that require restricted access for safety or security reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
work hard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker wants to turn an idea into a tangible reality, indicating that they need to take action to make this happen. Working hard is often crucial in turning ideas into reality, as it requires effort and dedication to see a project through to completion. The other options may be important in the process, but they do not necessarily convey the same sense of action and effort that working hard does.
park | Knowledge: The phrase "people love to play there" suggests that the soccer field is most likely located in a public space that is easily accessible to the community, such as a park. The other options, such as country, countryside, and near, do not provide enough information to determine the location of the soccer field. Town could be a possibility, but it is less likely than park because not all towns have public sports facilities.
bloom | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "opens up" suggests that the plant is experiencing a physical change, which is commonly associated with blooming. Photosynthesis refers to the process of sunlight being converted into energy by the plant, but does not involve a physical change in the plant. Having roots is not related to the process described in the question, nor are flower petals or springtime specifically mentioned.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a need for more physical space, which is typically associated with a larger living area such as a house. The other options do not make sense in the context of needing more physical space.
backpack | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is taking a long walk, which implies an outdoor activity. A suitcase or department store would be too cumbersome to bring on a walk, and a mall is not a place to store clothing during a walk. A purse is too small to store clothing. A backpack, on the other hand, is a common item used for outdoor activities, and is often used to hold extra clothing, water bottles, and other necessary items.
burial | Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to family members after death, which implies a physical process of handling their remains. The choices "sadness", "laughter", and "rebirth" do not relate to this physical process. "Decomposition" does describe what happens to the body after death, but the context of the question suggests a more cultural or social response to death. "Burial" is the most logical answer because it specifically refers to the process of laying the body to rest in a burial plot, which is a common cultural practice for handling the remains of loved ones after death.
shelf | Knowledge: The word "dust" suggests that the object in question is a surface that collects dust, such as a shelf. The other options, such as a coffee shop, fridge, or library, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A table could potentially be a surface to dust, but it is not specific enough in this case.
beside a counter | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sally searched in the places where she typically eats, and also in storage areas, so it is unlikely that she found the saltshaker in a restaurant or somewhere outside of her own home. The fact that she found it wedged beside a counter suggests that it was not in a kitchen cupboard or cabinet, but rather somewhere more out of the way.
using money | Knowledge: The sentence is referencing the act of buying, which involves exchanging money or some other form of payment for an item. Therefore, the correct answer is "using money." The other options involve negative consequences, such as feeling guilty or losing money, that are not necessarily inherent in the act of buying something.
rigor mortis | Knowledge: Rigor mortis is the stiffening of the body after death, which typically sets in within a few hours and lasts for a few days. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Unable to work" is not relevant to death, "change color" is too vague, "change of color" is grammatically incorrect, and "would cease to exist" is too extreme and does not address what would happen to the body specifically.
be a musician | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the subject had a passion for playing the violin, which is a key component of being a musician. The other answer choices do not capture the same level of dedication and commitment that being a musician entails. "Inspiring," "like music," and "tune" may be related to music, but they do not necessarily indicate a desire to actively engage in creating or playing it. "Make music" is too broad and does not specify the subject's particular interest in the violin.
warehouse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man needed a larger space to store his belongings, which implies that he needed more than just a small or temporary option like a dumpster or an attic. A building could be too broad of a term to describe what he specifically needed to rent. Michigan is not relevant to the context of the sentence. A warehouse is a commonly rented storage space that would fit the given context of the sentence.
gratifying | Knowledge: Making bread can be a fulfilling and satisfying task, as it involves creating something from scratch and seeing the final product come to fruition. The word "gratifying" implies a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment, which matches the idea of making bread. The options "pride" and "adept" suggest a level of skill or mastery, but do not necessarily relate to the enjoyment of making bread. "Mess" and "allergic reactions" have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of the question.
jog | Knowledge: Warming up before exercise is important in order to prevent injury and improve performance. Jogging is a common warm-up exercise for athletes because it increases blood flow, raises the body temperature, and prepares the muscles for more intense activity. Sprinting, running fast, and competing are all more intense exercises that would come after warming up. Using a heater is not a common way for athletes to warm up their legs.
herb garden | Knowledge: Bees are commonly found in herb gardens, as they are attracted to the nectar and pollen produced by the plants. Herb gardens provide a rich source of food for bees, making them a natural habitat for these insects. The other options do not make as much sense, as bees are not typically found alone, in storybooks, in the sky, or in the great outdoors.
live life | Knowledge: The question is asking about achieving happiness in a group, which suggests that the answer should be something that involves interaction with others. Singing and playing games can be social activities that may bring happiness, but they may not be suitable for everyone. Fiddling and jumping up and down are not commonly associated with group happiness. Therefore, the answer "live life" makes the most sense as it is a broad statement that can cover a wide range of activities that can be enjoyed with others.
trashcan | Knowledge: Trashcans are designed to hold and collect waste, making them the appropriate place to throw garbage. The other options mentioned do not have clear connections to the context of waste disposal. "Outside" could refer to various locations, some of which may not be appropriate for garbage disposal, such as public areas, bodies of water, or other environmentally sensitive areas. "Television" and "ground" are not related to waste disposal at all. "Landfill" is a location where waste is disposed of, but it is not where individuals typically throw their garbage directly.
listen to music | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described is commonly associated with relaxation. Eating whales for breakfast and eating trash do not make logical sense and are not commonly associated with relaxation. Having friends and hugging may be enjoyable activities, but they do not necessarily imply relaxation. In contrast, listening to music is a common activity associated with relaxation because it can help to slow the heart rate, reduce stress, and promote a sense of calm.
reverse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Gill was driving a car and needed to go back for something he forgot. Putting the car in reverse would allow him to back up and return to the previous location, while the other options do not make as much sense in this context. "Backwards" and "back and" are similar to "reverse" but are not specific to driving a car. "Straightforth" and "race" do not make any sense in this context.
synagogue | Knowledge: A yarmulke is a head covering worn by Jewish men as a sign of respect and submission to God. It is traditionally worn during prayer, Torah study, and other religious rituals. The other options in the choices (demonstration, concert, garage, bus stop) are not typically associated with religious practices or customs, so they can be eliminated as potential answers. This leaves the option of synagogue as the logical choice, as it is a place of worship for Jews where a yarmulke would be appropriate to wear.
dancing about | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Suzan is not joining in on the wild fun that Johnny, Jerry, and the others are having. The phrase "fiddling while" implies that Suzan is playing music, while the others are engaged in a more physical activity. The phrase "wild fun" suggests that they are not doing a traditional dance like square dancing, but rather moving about in a less orderly way. "Shuffle," "troubles," and "discovery" do not fit the context of the sentence.
suburb | Knowledge: Front yards are usually small in suburban areas because houses are typically built closer together in suburban neighborhoods than in rural areas, which means less space for front yards. Gardening, slip and slides, grass, and neighborhood are not likely to directly affect the size of a front yard.
fiction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that news and reality shows are not works of fiction, which means they are based on real events or people. Fiction refers to made-up stories, while news and reality shows are supposed to present real-life situations. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not directly relate to the nature of the programs.
working hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is applying for a job and making a promise to the manager. Promising to work hard is a common expectation for job interviews, as it shows the applicant's dedication and commitment to the job. The other options, such as frustration or stress, do not make sense in the context of a job interview. Overtime may be expected in certain jobs, but it would not be a promise made during an interview. Employment is also not a promise as it is the goal of the job application process.
sneezing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with cleaning house for only a short time. The option "exhaustion" and "tiredness" may seem plausible, but the sentence does not provide any evidence to support these choices. However, the sentence specifically mentions "sneezing," which could be a result of stirring up dust or allergens during cleaning. Therefore, "sneezing" is the most appropriate choice. The option "order" and "make money" are not supported by the context of the sentence.
feelings | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that people experience different emotions during the day, which is commonly associated with feelings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fall down | Knowledge: The question suggests that dead trees have a common behavior or characteristic, and the answer choice that best fits that behavior is "fall down." Dead trees are often weakened by rot and decay, which can cause them to become unstable and eventually fall over. The other answer choices do not accurately describe the behavior of dead trees.
hear stories | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common bedtime routine for children. Hearing stories before bed is a widely recognized tradition that many parents use to help their children relax and prepare for sleep. Play games, push ups, play with toys, and throw things are all activities that are less likely to promote relaxation and sleep, so they are less likely to be a common occurrence before bedtime.
exhaustion | Knowledge: Jogging is a high-impact exercise that requires cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength. Someone who is not used to this type of exercise may experience exhaustion due to their body not being accustomed to the physical demands of jogging. Better fitness, shortness of breath, and weight loss are potential positive outcomes of regular jogging, while blisters may occur due to improper footwear or friction between the skin and clothing.
office | Knowledge: Glasses are typically associated with reading or working on a computer, which are activities that are commonly done in an office setting. While glasses may also be used at home or during a meeting, these options are less specific and less likely to be the primary setting where people need glasses. Cabinet and cupboard are related to storage and have no clear connection to the use of glasses.
burn | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a danger to the trees due to the drought. One of the most common dangers for trees during a drought is the risk of wildfires or burns. This may occur because dry conditions can cause trees to become more flammable and susceptible to fires. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
form images | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was able to mentally create or visualize things that he wanted, which is commonly associated with forming images in one's mind. The phrase "play tricks on" and the word "hatred" have negative connotations and do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The word "tended" does not fit grammatically and "form thought" is a less likely choice compared to "form images" due to the specific mention of visualization or imagination in the sentence.
get hungry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when Jimmy and Tim play for a long time, they eventually have to stop because of a physical need- hunger. Learning and growing up are not physical needs that would cause them to stop playing, and injury seems unlikely since it is not mentioned in the sentence. Feeling happy is also not a clear reason for them to stop playing, as happiness would not impede their ability to continue playing.
good to eat | Knowledge: The question is asking for a type of apple that people prefer, which suggests that the answer should be related to taste or flavor. Good to eat is a common phrase used to describe apples that taste great, while crisp could also be a correct answer as crispness is often associated with freshness and good taste. However, grocery store, good for, and farm do not necessarily relate to taste and are less likely to be the correct answer.
cup chin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is creating something out of clay using their hands, which means they are likely sculpting or molding the clay. The phrase "more like" suggests that the person wants to make the clay resemble something else. The only option in the choices that could be related to this is "cup chin." This could mean that the person is trying to sculpt a cup and wants to create a lip or an indentation that would be similar to a human chin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
judge men | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a rule or guideline that members of the flock should be following, but many forget it. The phrase "on god can" indicates that the rule may involve God or religion. The phrase "judge men" is a common belief in many religions, stating that only God has the right to judge people for their actions or behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is looking to acquire a ball, which is a piece of sporting equipment. Therefore, the most likely option for obtaining a ball would be a sporting goods store, which is a retail establishment that specializes in selling sporting equipment. The other options may be places where balls are commonly used or found, but they do not necessarily provide a means for obtaining one. Cuddle is not a relevant option as it has no connection to the context of the question.
speak words | Knowledge: Speaking words is the most common form of communication amongst humans. This is because verbal communication allows individuals to exchange information and ideas with one another in a relatively efficient and precise manner. While dancing together and fighting can be forms of non-verbal communication, they are not as widely used as speaking words. Owning cars and believing in god are not related to the question of how people communicate.
get | Knowledge: The word "greed" suggests an excessive desire for something, in this case, energy. "Get" is the only option that makes sense in the context of an individual who has a strong desire for energy, as they would want to obtain as much energy as possible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that waiting for an appointment can lead to a negative emotion, and the word "boredom" is commonly associated with waiting in a situation where nothing is happening. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "impatience" might be a close runner-up, but it implies a different emotion than "boredom" and therefore is not the correct answer.
bedroom  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being described is not a natural habitat for sloths and that it may be illegal to keep them there. Basements and bedrooms are both indoor locations, but basements do not typically have restrictions on keeping animals. The universe is not a physical place on Earth where sloths could be found, and tropical jungles and Amazonia are natural habitats for sloths. Therefore, the correct answer is bedroom.
gas station | Knowledge: Gasoline is typically sold at gas stations, which are specifically designed to supply fuel to cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Power mowers and boats may use gasoline as a fuel source, but they would need to purchase it from a gas station (or other retailer) in order to obtain it. Refineries and oil rigs are production facilities that are involved in the extraction and processing of crude oil, but they are not typically associated with the retail sale of gasoline to end-users.
weather report | Knowledge: The sentence implies that meteorologists did not predict or forecast the storm, as it came as a surprise. The weather report is the document or broadcast where meteorologists communicate their predictions and warnings, so it is logical to assume that they did not mention the storm in the report. The other options do not provide any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
evaluate progress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is interested in more than just the answer and work shown. In this context, it is likely that the teacher wants the students to reflect on their work and evaluate their own progress. This will help them identify areas where they need to improve and continue on the path of growth and development. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stress | Knowledge: The act of selling a house can be a stressful experience for many homeowners as it involves numerous tasks such as preparing the home for sale, marketing the property, and negotiating with potential buyers. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence, as walking or relaxing are not commonly associated with the process of selling a house, while spending money may be an aspect of selling a house but not a feeling that the homeowner would have.
learn to speak | Knowledge: The question is asking about a developmental milestone that happens prior to a baby being able to talk. While the choices "boy or girl" and "ride a bike" are not relevant to the question, the other choices allow for some analysis. "Talk nonsense" and "begin to talk" both suggest that the baby is starting to speak, which is not what the question is asking. Therefore, "learn to speak" is the best answer, as it describes the stage prior to the baby being able to talk in a meaningful way.
livingroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the host needed an extra table to accommodate all the guests, which indicates that the main dining area was not enough. The living room is a common area in a home that can easily be converted into a dining space, making it a practical option for setting up an extra table. The other options, such as the hall or card room, are less likely to be used for dining purposes.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the older gentlemen enjoyed outdoor activities, specifically on clear warm days. Chess is a game that can be played outside, and parks are a common location for people to gather and play games. Retirement communities or libraries may have outdoor spaces, but they are not specifically identified as locations for outdoor activities like a park would be. A pool or cabinet do not seem like appropriate locations for playing chess.
truthful | Knowledge: The use of the word "oath" suggests that the person is being sworn in to some kind of official or formal position, and that they are making a solemn promise to uphold certain values or principles. In this context, it is likely that the correct answer is "truthful," as taking an oath typically implies a commitment to honesty and integrity. The other choices, such as "not fib" and "not lie," are synonyms for "truthful," but they are not as formal or specific to the context of taking an oath. The options "sense of duty" and "think" are not related to the concept of taking an oath.
understand details | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that reading the manual after buying a product has a specific benefit. It implies that the manual contains information that will allow the reader to better understand the product and how to use it. Therefore, the answer is "understand details." The other options do not fit the context and are not related to the purpose of reading the manual.
television program | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the narrator was sitting on a couch and enjoying something, which is most likely a form of entertainment that can be viewed on a television program. The fact that the narrator was discussing the behaviors of a gazelle indicates that they were likely watching a nature program on television. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sign language | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using hands is a method of communication, which is commonly associated with sign language. Sign language is a visual language that uses hand gestures, facial expression, and body language to convey meaning. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
military band | Knowledge: The question suggests that playing the bugle is a significant part of a particular group, and the context of the question points towards a military context. A military band is a group within the American army that plays music during military ceremonies, and playing the bugle is a traditional part of that role. The other choices do not fit with the given context and do not have any clear association with bugle playing.
mass | Knowledge: Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 shows that energy and mass are equivalent and interchangeable. This means that energy is made of mass, and vice versa. The other choices (weakness, play sports, entropy) are not related to Einstein's work on the nature of energy.
produce food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject of discussion is what a farmer does. "Produce food" is the most appropriate option because it encompasses both livestock and crops. "Raise crops," "grow corn," and "plant seeds" only refer to the cultivation of crops whereas "can produce" implies the preservation of food rather than its creation.
marry each other | Knowledge: The phrase "a couple forever" suggests a committed and long-term relationship that is formalized in some way. In most cultures, marriage is the formalization of a committed relationship, and the other options do not fit the context of the question. Additionally, communication is an important factor in maintaining any relationship, but it is not the specific action that would make a relationship last "forever."
hardware store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the object being considered is likely to be made out of a wooden rod. Brooms and old clocks are often made with wooden handles or parts, and old houses might have wooden beams or framing. A broom closet may also have a wooden handle, so it is less likely to be the correct answer compared to hardware store. A hardware store is a place where tools, equipment, and building materials are sold, not an object made out of a wooden rod, so it is the least likely answer.
British Columbia | Knowledge: Victoria is the capital city of British Columbia, which is a province located on the west coast of Canada. The other options are not located in Canada and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
panic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that starting work after it is too late can have negative consequences, which may cause someone to feel panicked. Deadlines may also be a consequence of starting work too late, but the sentence specifically mentions what could happen as a result of beginning work late. Accomplishing and momentum are not negative consequences, and sitting down does not relate to the context of the sentence.
fish market | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker doesn't get much crab where they live in a rural area. Among the choices, only "fish market" is a viable option as it refers to a place where seafood, including crab, can be bought. The other options are either specific geographic locations or vague terms that do not relate to the context of the sentence.
theater or opera house | Knowledge: Balconies are commonly found in theaters and opera houses, where they provide an elevated view of the stage. Concerts are typically held in open-air venues or indoor arenas without balconies. New Orleans and Michigan are locations, but do not provide any information to indicate where someone could watch a show from a balcony.
ask questions | Knowledge: The sentence states that the child was curious about something, which implies that he had a desire to know or learn more. Asking questions is a natural and common way for children to satisfy their curiosity and gain knowledge about the world around them. The other options do not relate to the idea of curiosity or seeking knowledge.
hike | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the couple is excited about the good weather and is looking forward to engaging in an outdoor activity. While some of the other options may involve being outside, hiking specifically involves walking through nature, which is likely what the couple is excited to do. The other options do not necessarily require good weather to enjoy or do not involve being in nature.
brown meat | Knowledge: Browning meat is a common technique used when preparing meat on a stove. This involves cooking the meat over high heat until it develops a brown crust on the outside, which helps to seal in the juices and adds flavor to the dish. The other options do not relate to cooking meat specifically or do not make sense in the context of cooking.
form opinions | Knowledge: The question is asking about a key aspect of child development, specifically the point at which a child moves away from purely imitating and following others and starts to assert their own independent thinking. This is a critical stage in cognitive development and is closely linked to the formation of opinions and beliefs. The other choices, such as 'grow up' and 'become adult' are more general, and do not specifically relate to this developmental milestone. 'Set table' and 'gather flowers' are activities that may or may not be related to child development, but they do not specifically relate to the stage of development the question is referring to.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James went to a nearby location for food because his own food was contaminated. Since the nearby location is across the street, it is most likely a neighbor's house rather than a more distant location like a military base or fairgrounds. The other options such as garage and table do not make sense as places to get food.
cool temperature | Knowledge: In the sentence, it is stated that the oven was turned off and left open. This indicates that the oven was being allowed to cool down after use. Leaving the oven open after turning it off helps to speed up the cooling process and prevent residual heat from heating up the surrounding area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
answer question | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about what the student will have to do specifically "on the test." This indicates that the answer should relate to a task or activity that is commonly associated with taking a test. "Answer question" fits this criteria, as tests often require students to answer a series of questions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Steve found an underground map unexpectedly while he was shopping for items that are commonly found in a supermarket. Therefore, the most likely answer is that he found it in the supermarket. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
metro station | Knowledge: The context suggests that the person is waiting for a ride that will arrive on rails, which is a common feature of metro stations. The other options do not involve rail transportation, and therefore do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
candy store | Knowledge: A cash register with a limited items line typically indicates a small business with a limited inventory. Candy stores often have a smaller selection of items compared to supermarkets or toy stores, which may explain why they would use a cash register with a limited items line. Bookstores and shops may have a larger inventory of items, and the context of the sentence does not provide enough information to indicate a clear connection to a specific type of retailer.
eastern united states | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the travelers encountered toll roads while on a road trip through New England and "other parts" of a certain region. The only option that refers to a geographical region is "eastern united states", which includes states like Connecticut and New York that are part of New England. Florida and the sea are not part of the same region mentioned in the sentence.
room | Knowledge: The question asks for a location to move furniture, which suggests that it needs to be placed somewhere accessible and usable. Of the given options, only "room" fits this description, since storing the furniture would mean it's not in use, placing it on a rug is not a specific location, putting it at a friend's house is not practical, and moving it online doesn't make sense.
chicken | Knowledge: Soups can be made with a variety of ingredients, but chicken is one of the most common and popular ingredients used as a base for soup broth. This is because chicken is a versatile and flavorful ingredient that can be used in a variety of soup recipes. The other options (ocean, puddle, glass) are irrelevant and don't have any connection to soup-making.
arthritis | Knowledge: While any of the choices could potentially cause knee pain after jogging, the mention of a medical condition like arthritis suggests that it may be a more serious or chronic issue. Arthritis is a common cause of joint pain and can be exacerbated by physical activity. The other options, such as losing weight or feeling better, may be beneficial for overall health but do not necessarily address the specific cause of knee pain after jogging.
blaring | Knowledge: The word "not very good" suggests that the band's performance may be lacking in quality or skill. The word "blaring" fits with this context as it means loud and harsh, which could be a result of the sound being unpleasant due to a lack of proficiency. The other choices do not necessarily relate to the consequences of a band not being very good. Playing music, including a drummer, recording an album, and having an encore are all actions or events that could occur regardless of the quality of the band's performance.
school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the troublemaker is in a location where smoking is not allowed, and the most common place to sneak a smoke in such a setting is usually the bathroom. The options "playground," "hotel," "theater," and "convenience store" do not have the same association with schools and smoking restrictions.
demonstration | Knowledge: Demonstrations are often used as a means of expressing a point of view or advocating for a particular cause. Signs stating a point of view are commonly seen at demonstrations, making this the most likely choice. Freeways, state parks, stores, and corners of two streets do not necessarily have a connection to signs stating a point of view.
listen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is trying to communicate with someone who is nearby and can hear them. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to listening. The other options do not make sense in this context, as the speaker is not asking the listener to do anything other than listen.
cost money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a reason why someone might not get things they need. Among the choices, "cost money" is the most logical reason. It is common for people to not be able to afford things they need, especially if they are expensive. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why someone might not get things they need. "Fall apart," "be demanding," "happen to," and "go wrong" are all related to the quality or condition of the things needed, but they do not necessarily explain why the person is not getting them in the first place.
sufficient | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the thing being described is not bad, but also not too good. This implies that it is adequate or satisfactory, which is the definition of "sufficient." The other options such as "excellent," "outstanding," "exceptional," and "superior" all suggest quality that is beyond adequate or satisfactory, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
create | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the question is asking about what people in the art industry work hard to do, which is likely to be related to the creative process. While earning money and making decisions may be important aspects of working in the art industry, they are not specifically related to what people work hard to do. Having imagination is a trait that may be important for people in the art industry to have, but it is not necessarily something that they work hard to do. Producing goods may be a goal of people in the art industry, but it is not as specific as creating, which is the most logical answer given the context of the sentence.
stopping | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James took his time walking home, indicating that he was moving slowly. The phrase "at every place along the way" implies that James was stopping frequently. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest that James was standing still or dancing, which would indicate a different type of activity.
root cellar | Knowledge: The fact that the potato plants are growing through the floorboards suggests that they are growing underground. The only option that indicates an underground location is root cellar. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
transportation system | Knowledge: The phrase "train terminals" indicates that the subject is related to trains and their operations. The use of the word "several" suggests that there are more than one terminal involved, which implies a larger system or network. The term "transportation system" encompasses all the methods, facilities and service providers involved in moving people or goods from one place to another. Therefore, this is the most suitable option among the given choices. The other options do not match the context or meaning of the sentence.
bridge of ship | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a captain in the context of a ship on the sea. In this context, the correct answer would be the bridge of the ship, which is where the captain typically commands the vessel. The other options, such as military, battleship, basketball team, and cruise ship, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or to the role of a captain on a ship.
anger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting someone else is being used as a means to express something, which implies that the action is intentional. Anger is a common emotional state that people might try to express through negative actions, such as harming others. The other options do not fit the context, as feeling sad, happy, arrested or suffering would not typically lead to the desire to hurt someone else.
shelf | Knowledge: The question is asking where you store dry food, implying that it is in your own possession. A shelf is a common place to store dry food in a home or pantry setting. Supermarkets are not a storage location for personal dry food, and neither are military bases or a neighbor's house. In the garage, dry food is at risk of being exposed to temperature changes and pests, making it an unsuitable storage location.
drawer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that one of the individuals in the scenario retrieved a contraceptive from a specific location, which is likely to be a nightstand drawer. Nightstand drawers are a common storage location for small items like condoms, and it makes sense that one would be kept there in case of such a situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
warm place | Knowledge: The sentence makes it clear that the human is feeling cold and needs to find a place to warm up quickly. Of the choices given, "warm place" is the only one that directly addresses the need for warmth. The other options are less likely to offer immediate relief from the cold, as a nearest house or office block may not be accessible, and a school or surface of the earth would not necessarily be warm.
pain and suffering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that doing housework caused negative effects on the old man's back. This implies that the action of doing housework was physically painful for him, which is consistent with the choice "pain and suffering." The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not offer a reasonable explanation for what happened to the old man.
brass band | Knowledge: The sentence states that everyone in John's band plays brass instruments, which suggests that the band in question is a brass band. Brass bands are typically composed of brass instruments such as trumpets, trombones, euphoniums, and tubas. The other choices such as jazz, punk rock, and marching bands could include brass instruments, but they are not exclusively focused on brass instruments as a defining characteristic. "Annoy mom" is not a type of band.
towns | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in smaller places, there are fewer needs for a bus stop. This suggests that the larger the place, the more likely there are to be multiple stops, indicating a higher level of bus traffic. Therefore, the options that are larger and more densely populated, such as urban areas and airports, are less likely to have fewer bus stops. The option "boarding bus" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, as it is not a place or location.
music shop | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where one can buy a harp, which is a musical instrument. The most logical option is a music shop, as it is a common retail establishment that specializes in selling musical instruments. The other options, such as Michigan or an Irish bar, do not have any clear association with selling musical instruments, while a concert hall is a venue for performances rather than a retail store. "Create music" is a vague option that does not provide a specific location to purchase a harp.
specific | Knowledge: When scientists discover a new animal, they typically want to identify its specific characteristics or unique features that differentiate it from other known animals. This includes physical traits, behavior patterns, habitat, and DNA makeup. Identifying these specific traits is important for classification and understanding the animal's role in its ecosystem. The other options do not fit the context of the question as scientists would not be interested in experimenting on a new animal just because it is discovered, or in determining whether it is "nice" or not. Additionally, plants are not relevant to the question.
ground | Knowledge: Rocks are commonly found on the ground, especially in rocky areas such as beaches, deserts, and riverbanks. While rocks can also be found in mountains and mountain ranges, the options emphasizing mountains and a bridge are less likely because rocks may not be readily available in these areas. Similarly, while some forest floors may have rocks, it is not as characteristic as finding rocks on the ground in general.
Manhattan | Knowledge: The phrase "upper west side" is a reference to a specific area in Manhattan, New York City. The other options, such as Toronto, San Jose, and large city, do not have an upper west side and are therefore not logical answers. "City underground" may refer to a subway system, but it does not provide any context for the location of the landmarks the tourists were seeing.
free trade zones | Knowledge: Free trade zones are designated areas where goods can be imported, manufactured, and/or exported without paying taxes or customs duties. By building in a free trade zone, Lindy can save money on taxes and potentially increase profits. The other options do not have any clear connection to Lindy's goal of minimizing taxes.
pocket | Knowledge: Keeping a comb in a pocket is a common practice for travelers, as it allows easy access to the comb when needed. Shoes are an unlikely storage location for a comb, and a suitcase is a possibility but may be less convenient than carrying it in a pocket. Barber shops are places where one might use a comb, but not necessarily keep it, and a medicine cabinet is a storage location typically associated with personal hygiene items kept in a home or hotel room.
classroom | Knowledge: The word "teacher" suggests that the context is related to a classroom setting, where books would typically be shared among students. The other options are not typically associated with sharing books in a classroom. "Cabinet" and "shelf" suggest storage, while "bookbag" is usually associated with carrying books, and "desktop" is not typically used for sharing books in a classroom.
cargo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are specific items being transported on a train, and the word "cargo" is commonly used to refer to goods and materials being transported by a vehicle such as a train. The other options are unrelated to transportation or cargo.
hang out  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity is casual and doesn't involve any specific task or purpose. Hanging out is a common term used to describe spending time together in a relaxed and informal way. The other options do not match the context of the sentence; smoking and partying are specific activities, homework involves studying, and volunteering involves doing something productive for a cause.
entertained | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that broadcasting the same shows to everyone through television can potentially lead to a certain outcome. The other choices such as innovation, visual and falling asleep are irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The option "conformity" might seem like a possible answer as well, but it has a negative connotation, whereas the sentence seems to suggest a positive outcome. Therefore, "entertained" is the most appropriate answer as television is often used for entertainment purposes.
boat | Knowledge: The question is asking where it is required to have a single fire extinguisher, which implies that there may be specific regulations or laws governing this requirement. A common regulation is that all boats must have at least one fire extinguisher on board. This is because boats have a higher risk of fire due to the presence of flammable materials such as fuel, oil, and propane, as well as the limited ability to escape a fire on a vessel. The other options may also require fire extinguishers, but there is no clear indication of a specific requirement for a single extinguisher in those locations.
pocket | Knowledge: Lint is typically made up of small fibers from clothing or fabric. Pockets are a common place for lint to accumulate, especially in clothing that sheds fibers easily or has been washed multiple times. Purses and rugs may also collect lint, but are less likely to be associated with large amounts of lint compared to pockets. Laundromats and beaches are not typically places where lint would accumulate in large quantities.
map | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the place in question is unique and perhaps even secluded or off the beaten path. Since maps generally show all known locations, including popular tourist destinations and major landmarks, the fact that this place cannot be found on just any map suggests that it is not widely known or easily accessible. The other options do not provide any clear clues to help determine the correct answer.
talking | Knowledge: The question suggests that making friends with someone of the opposite sex leads to a certain outcome. "Talking" is the most appropriate answer, as making friends involves getting to know someone and communicating with them. "Falling in love" could be a possibility, but it is not always the case and is not the most common outcome when making friends. "Smiling" is a friendly gesture but does not necessarily imply a deeper connection. "Shake hands" is a formal greeting and is unlikely to lead to a friendship. "Punch in the face" is aggressive and does not fit the context of making friends.
own death | Knowledge: The use of the word "murder" suggests that the person has intentionally caused the death of another person. The mention of an injection further suggests that the person is referring to the death penalty, which is a form of capital punishment in which a lethal injection is administered to the convicted criminal. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hard | Knowledge: The context suggests that resisting the chocolates will be a challenge for the person on a diet. The word 'hard' is often used to describe something that is challenging or difficult to do. The other options - 'difficult', 'harsh', 'severe', and 'strict' - have negative connotations that are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
coaster | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a need to protect the table from something that may harm or damage it, which is commonly done by placing a protective item such as a coaster. Coasters are typically used to prevent the condensation from drinks to leave watermarks or rings on surfaces, and to shield delicate surfaces from scratches or heat damage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
basketball court | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is playing basketball and has been taught to defend the "key," which is a specific area on the basketball court close to the basket. Therefore, the answer is likely "basketball court." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hunt for food | Knowledge: The phrase "sharp teeth" suggests that the animal is a carnivore, which means they eat meat. The phrase "what for dinner" implies that the animal is figuring out how to get their meal. The option "buffalo" is a herbivore, so they wouldn't have sharp teeth to catch prey. "Fight for life" and "leave home" are not related to the idea of finding food. "Eating" is not a behavior or action, but rather a result of the animal's actions.
milk cow | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the specific source of the food a person needs - a dairy. A dairy is a place where milk and dairy products are produced, so it would be logical for someone to get the needed food by obtaining milk from a cow at the dairy. The other options in the list do not relate to the specific context of needing food from a dairy.
stomach aches | Knowledge: The sentence implies that eating too much can cause pain, and specifically mentions stomach aches, which are commonly associated with overeating. The other options, including food, getting full, full stomach, and full belly, may be true statements, but do not specifically address the question of what kind of pain overeating will lead to.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location is a place where kids can have privacy and avoid their parents, so it is likely a secluded area in the house. The basement is typically a separate, enclosed space that is not heavily trafficked by adults, making it an ideal place for kids to hang out. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
military | Knowledge: The use of the word "olive" suggests that the bag is a type of military or utilitarian bag, as olive green is a common color used in military gear. Additionally, the phrase "drawstring bag" is often used to describe the type of bag issued to military personnel. The other options, such as an airport or department store, do not have any clear connection to the description of the bag.
food | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the squirrel has been able to easily access a source of food, which has resulted in it becoming plump. Among the options provided, nuts are the closest to food and are a common source of nutrition for squirrels. The other choices, such as chipmunks and rabbits, do not make sense in the context of providing food for the squirrel.
office building | Knowledge: Skylights are windows installed in a roof or ceiling to allow natural light to penetrate the building. While residential buildings like houses may have skylights as well, the context suggests a commercial or professional setting, making an office building the most likely choice. A windowless room would not have a skylight, and a company is too broad of a term to make an educated guess.
british columbia | Knowledge: The question provides context that the region being referred to lies just below the northern border, suggesting that it is located in Canada. The options given include states in the United States (Oregon, Washington, Idaho) and a province in Canada (British Columbia). Since the sentence mentions the pacific northwest, which is a region commonly associated with the upper west coast of North America, it is likely that the correct answer is the Canadian province of British Columbia, which is located just north of Washington state. The other options are located in the United States, which is not where the northern border is located.
lay down | Knowledge: The question is asking for the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed, which suggests they are preparing for sleep or rest. Therefore, the correct option is likely to involve the act of getting into bed. Of the choices provided, "lay down" is the option that best fits this criteria. The other options - bedsores, bed sores, sleep in, and open the curtain - do not involve the act of getting into bed and are therefore incorrect.
take off | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bo has dirty clothes that need to be removed in order for him to put on clean clothes. This implies that the correct answer should indicate a process of removing the dirty clothes. "Take off" is the option that best fits this criteria, as it means to remove something from one's body or a surface. The other options do not involve removing the dirty clothes.
eat food or drink water | Knowledge: Eating food and drinking water are normal and expected noises to make while having lunch. Burping can be seen as impolite in some cultures, but it is not necessarily a sign of danger. Choking and vomiting, on the other hand, are serious health concerns that should be addressed immediately. The question specifically asks for a noise that does not indicate you might die soon, so the answer must be either eating or drinking.
sky | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Bill is looking up, which implies that he is looking at something above him. The sky is the most logical answer, as it is above ground level and is visible outside. The other options (nature, sun, rain, and ground) do not necessarily have to do with what someone sees when looking up outside.
ocean | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you are jumping out of a cruise ship, which is typically in the middle of the ocean. The other options (marina, airport, stairwell, island) do not make sense in the context of jumping out of a cruise ship.
pantry | Knowledge: Potato chips are a common snack food item that people often keep in their homes. Storing them in a supermarket or bar would not make sense, as these types of places are intended for commercial purposes. Storing them in a toilet or motherboard would not be appropriate either, as these items are not typically used for food storage. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be pantry, which is a common storage area for dry goods and snacks in many homes.
acknowledgment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is being complimentary and making trivial physical contact, which could indicate that they are trying to show appreciation, approval, or recognition for something. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Moreover, the use of terms such as "get laid" and "talk about themselves" sounds inappropriate and unprofessional, so acknowledgment seems like the correct answer.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the mustard has been opened, which implies that it needs to be stored in a way that will keep it fresh. Refrigerators are commonly used to store condiments and other perishable foods after they have been opened, in order to prevent spoilage and maintain flavor. The other options are not appropriate places to store mustard, as they do not provide a cool enough environment to keep it from spoiling.
feather | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people used to use a type of pen called a quill that was dipped in ink. The word "quill" commonly refers to a feather of a bird, which was the material used to make the pen. Additionally, historical documents often mention feathers being used for writing, further supporting the idea that feathers were commonly used for this purpose. The other options, such as peacock or porcupine, do not fit the context and are not commonly associated with writing. Calligraphy is a style of writing, not a material used for writing.
victory in war | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that one side is winning and the other is losing and that the losers will not get to celebrate something that the winners will. The phrase "victory in war" is commonly associated with celebration, especially with regards to military conflicts where the outcome is seen as a significant achievement. The other options are too broad and not specifically related to the context of the sentence.
pacific northwest | Knowledge: Bald eagles are commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which includes Washington state and northern California. Floating bridges are also a common sight in this area, particularly in the Seattle area where Lake Washington is located. This suggests that the most likely location to find a bald eagle on a floating bridge would be in the Pacific Northwest region. Canada is also home to bald eagles, but the sentence specifically mentions a floating bridge, which may be less common in Canada.
garbage dump | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where a lot of trash accumulates and continues to increase over time. A garbage dump is a common location for this, as it is where waste is disposed of and can pile up over time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not necessarily imply a continuous and increasing amount of trash.
demonstration | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the engineer is presenting a new invention to his bosses, and turning on the microphone indicates that he is preparing to give a speech or presentation. The option "demonstration" is the most appropriate because it reflects the action of showing how the invention works, which is the expected activity in this scenario. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not commonly associated with presenting something new or demonstrating how it works.
different | Knowledge: The sentence makes a comparison between each person and snowflakes, which are known for being unique in their individual shape and form. Therefore, the correct answer is "different," indicating that each person is distinct and not identical to any other. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the idea of uniqueness.
bee hive | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Billy was a bee, and bees typically live in bee hives. The other options, such as Michigan or the United States, are too broad and do not have a direct connection to the fact that Billy was a bee. Similarly, orchards and apiaries may be places where bees are present, but they do not specifically describe where Billy lived.
order | Knowledge: When you're standing in line for food, the natural next step would be placing your order. "Wait turn" is too generic as it doesn't specify what you're waiting to do, and "pay" would come after you order. "Frustration" and "pain" are not actions, and don't make sense as answers to this question.
suburb | Knowledge: Dentist offices are often found in areas that have a high concentration of residential homes, which is typically the case in suburban areas. The other options listed are less likely to have a high concentration of residential homes and are generally not associated with homes and businesses that would require dental services.
office building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dentist's office is located in an unconventional or unexpected place, which makes the option "candy shop" less likely since dental offices are not commonly found in candy shops. "Medical center" is a reasonable option, but the sentence specifies that the office is in a "strange place," which does not necessarily describe a typical medical center. "Town" and "patient" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most plausible option is "office building," as many dental practices are located within larger commercial or professional buildings.
mail order | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the company did not have physical stores in the area, indicating that they likely used other methods of selling. The most logical choice is mail order, as it allows companies to sell products without needing a physical storefront. Shipping goods and peddling may require some sort of physical presence in the area, and owning resources and branching out do not seem to make sense in this context.
correct answer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John made a mistake when he picked A, but he later found out that A was the correct answer. Therefore, John was relieved because he didn't make a mistake after all. The word "mistake" and the phrase "picked A by accident" indicate that John did not intend to choose A. The option "correct answer" is the most logical since John was relieved to learn that A was indeed the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
meeting new people | Knowledge: The social benefit of going to a party is the opportunity to expand one's social circle and meet new people. This is often a primary motivation for attending social events, as it provides an avenue for making new friends and connections. Getting drunk and having fun may be associated with partying, but they are not necessarily social benefits. Food and planning are also not typically cited as social benefits of partying.
race track | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity in question involves large four-legged animals running, which is commonly associated with horse racing. Race tracks are venues specifically designed for horse racing and are a gathering place for people to watch horses run. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
auditorium | Knowledge: An auditorium is a common venue for shows or performances, where tickets can be purchased at a box office or online. A stadium and arena are typically used for sports events, while a home is not a public space to purchase tickets. An opera house may also be a viable option for purchasing tickets to a show, but an auditorium is a more generic term that can apply to different types of shows or performances.
catching fish | Knowledge: Going fishing is typically done in pursuit of catching fish, which is often seen as the ultimate goal or reward for the activity. Getting food is a possible outcome of catching fish, but it is not the primary reason for going fishing. Wet clothes and wetness are not desirable outcomes but are often a result of being near water while fishing. Getting drunk is not typically associated with the activity of fishing.
tensions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a competitive situation between two people, which often creates tension. This tension may result from the desire to win or the fear of losing, which can lead to heightened emotions such as frustration, pride, or even anger. While emotions are likely to be present in a competitive situation, the focus of the sentence is on the tension that is created when two people are competing against each other. The word "encouraging" does not fit in the context of the sentence as it suggests a positive outcome.
spring forth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something is happening as a result of the warming up of spring, and the phrase "spring forth" indicates growth or emergence. This makes sense given that spring is often associated with new life and growth, as plants and animals come out of hibernation and begin to bloom. The other options, such as "die" or "cause death," do not align with the idea of spring being a time of renewal and growth.
competent | Knowledge: The phrase "not bad" implies that the person is at least average or above average in their work. The word "competent" means having the necessary skills and abilities to do something well, which would fit the context of someone who is not bad at their job. The other options do not necessarily convey the same meaning of being skilled or proficient in a particular area.
large city | Knowledge: Subway stations are typically found in densely populated areas with high traffic, which are usually large cities. The other options may have subway systems, but they do not necessarily have stations in the same abundance as large cities.
work | Knowledge: Generally, people go to office buildings to work, so this would be the most likely answer. The other options are possible reasons for going to an office building, but they are not as general and obvious as "work." For example, "advertising company" and "project" suggest a more specific purpose. "New York" and "city" are not inherently related to office buildings or why people might go there.
play | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity being referred to is a game, with one person pretending to be a cop and another pretending to be a robber. The word "play" is the most appropriate choice as it refers to engaging in recreational activities for enjoyment, which is the context of this sentence. The other options, such as "distrust" and "deception", do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to playing a game.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject went against their doctor's recommendation by eating breakfast in bed, which may imply that the subject was not feeling well. However, the question is asking about the subject's emotions, and the fact that they chose to eat breakfast in bed despite their doctor's orders may suggest a feeling of happiness or indulgence. The other options, such as feeling guilty, weight gain, spills, or indigestion, do not match the context of the sentence.
refrigerators | Knowledge: The context of the question is asking about where to store cold food, which typically requires a cold temperature to keep the food safe and prevent spoilage. The option "refrigerators" is the only choice that involves a cold environment, which is necessary for storing cold food. The other options are not related to the context of the question and do not provide a suitable answer.
car wrecks  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny learned something disturbing about driving and statistics. The fact that "it causes" suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with driving. The choices "deaths," "car wrecks," and "may die" all relate to negative consequences of driving. However, "moving" and "using gas" do not have any clear connection to negative consequences of driving. Considering that Danny is studying statistics, it is likely that the negative consequence he learned about is related to data on car accidents, further suggesting that the correct answer is "car wrecks."
dental office | Knowledge: A dental office is where you would typically go to visit a dentist, as this is where most dental practices are located. The other options, such as a fair, phone book, city, or Las Vegas, do not have any clear connection to dental care or visiting a dentist.
hurting | Knowledge: The word "bad" in the question implies a negative or harmful action. "Ignore" and "do nothing" suggest inaction rather than actively doing harm. "Hinder" and "giving trouble" may not necessarily be harmful but can still be unhelpful. "Hurting" is the only option that clearly indicates a harmful action that does not benefit the person being hurt.
bundle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pricing of the flooring was dependent on the quantity purchased. The word "bundle" implies that the flooring was sold in multiples or in bulk, and the more bundles you bought, the bigger the discount you received. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
invigorating | Knowledge: The word "end" suggests that the person wants to stop relaxing and move on to something else. Of the choices given, only "invigorating" implies a change from a relaxed state to a more active and energized one. "Feeling better," "sleeping," and "deep breathing" all suggest ways to prolong or enhance relaxation, while "stress" is the opposite of relaxation and not a desirable outcome.
post office | Knowledge: When you need to send a package or letter, you go to the post office to purchase postage and have it weighed on a scale. The weight of the item determines how much postage you need to pay. This connection between weight and price is not typically made in the other settings listed in the choices.
candy store | Knowledge: A candy store is a place that typically offers a wide variety of chocolates, including different brands, flavors, and types such as milk, dark, or white chocolate. A box of chocolates may also contain a variety of flavors, but it is not a place where one can regularly find a wide selection of chocolate. Drug stores and movies may have some types of chocolate, but they typically do not offer a wide variety. Christmas stockings may contain chocolate, but they are not a place where one can regularly find a wide selection of chocolate either.
college | Knowledge: The keyword in the question is "classes," indicating a formal setting for learning. While it's possible to learn on your own in your living room or a music room, those options do not imply a structured curriculum with trained instructors. Similarly, "house" and "band" are too broad and don't specifically address the question of where to take classes. "College" is the best option because it's a common place to take music classes and often has specialized areas for music education.
being happy | Knowledge: "Fiddling" is a term commonly associated with playing a fiddle or violin at a hoedown, which is usually a lively and upbeat dance party held in rural areas. Therefore, it can be inferred that someone who is "fiddling at a hoedown" is likely enjoying themselves and feeling happy. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
closet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to dry their clothes in a space that is not a traditional dryer. They hung up their clothes and then pointed an electric fan at them, which suggests that they are in a closed space like a closet. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
unexpected | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when things go astray (i.e. deviate from the routine), a person finds it odd. This implies that the routine is a familiar and habitual pattern of behavior, and therefore, any deviation from it would be unexpected. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either describe something that is already part of the routine (habitual, even, expected) or imply a different meaning altogether (common).
traveler | Knowledge: The sentence is stating that the person goes on many vacations, which implies that they are someone who enjoys traveling. The term "vacationgoer" could also be correct, but "traveler" is a more commonly used and generally applicable term for someone who frequently goes on trips. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or are more specific terms that are not as appropriate.
freeway | Knowledge: Freeways are often the fastest option for driving long distances, such as traveling to an airport for a flight connection. They generally have limited access points, which means that traffic can move quickly and without interruption. The other options, such as "secret passageway" and "computer network," are not realistic options for driving to an airport.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing frisbee is a possible activity after enjoying hot dogs, which is a common food item served at parks during outdoor activities. Playing frisbee is also a popular pastime for people to enjoy at parks. The other options such as the house, Disneyland, bowling alley, and sporting event do not have any clear connection to playing frisbee.
treasure chest | Knowledge: The context suggests that the gold was collected by pirates or sailors with a stereotypical appearance often associated with pirates (peg legs and parrots), which makes it likely that the treasure was stored in a treasure chest. This is a trope often seen in movies and literature about pirates. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
illiterate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was pretending to read because they were not actually capable of reading due to illiteracy. "Illiteracy" and "illiterate" directly relate to not being able to read or write. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence - "watching TV" and "acculturation" have no relation to reading ability, while "at grade level" suggests the person was able to read but may have been struggling to keep up with expectations in school.
doctor's office | Knowledge: Annual weight checks are commonly performed by medical professionals such as doctors or nurses, which suggests that the person in question is likely going to a doctor's office. While other options such as the bathroom or post office may have scales, they would not be used for annual weight checks in the same way a doctor's office would. The other options such as music store or fish hatchery have no clear connection to weight checks or scales.
cheers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the home school's team was playing a sport, specifically basketball, and that each score brought a certain reaction from the crowd. The most common reaction to a score in basketball is cheering, so that would be the most likely answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of a sports game - sweating, having fun, and dancing are possible reactions, but not specific to a score, while pain would not be a positive reaction.
healthy children | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about a common desire of parents. It is a well-known fact that most parents want their children to be healthy and happy as that is a crucial aspect of parental responsibility. The other options may be desirable for some parents but they do not capture the fundamental responsibility of being a parent as clearly as the option of healthy children.
not die | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "without being killed" suggests that George is in a dangerous situation where any movement could result in his death. Therefore, the correct answer would involve an action that would help him avoid that outcome. Eliminating the options "lay still," "stationary," "staying put," and "be still," leaves "not die" as the most logical answer.
bath room | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the shower is located in a room that is commonly associated with bathing, such as a bathroom. The other options, such as a spa or hotel, may have showers available, but they are not specific to the context of a home. A motel room or locker room also do not fit the context of a home.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence asks for the opposite of pain, which is commonly understood to be pleasure. Enjoyment and feeling good are similar concepts, but do not directly oppose pain like pleasure does. Agony is actually a synonym for extreme pain, so it is not the opposite.
bus depot | Knowledge: The word "passengers" suggests that the question is referring to public transportation. While passengers can wait in a vehicle or a car, those are not typically designated waiting areas. A train station is specifically for trains and not buses. Therefore, the best option is a "bus depot," which is a designated location for buses to pick up and drop off passengers and provides waiting areas for riders.
sit up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was lying down in bed and then did something before standing. The most logical thing to do before standing from a lying position would be to sit up first. The other options, such as putting on shoes or conversing with their spouse, do not necessarily require the person to sit up first. Saying "love" or thanking God might be something a person would do upon waking up, but they would not necessarily have to do it before standing up.
surf net | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John doesn't enjoy watching television and is looking for something to do with his free time. The options "watch film" and "see favorite show" relate to television, which John doesn't enjoy. "Play cards" and "talking on the phone" involve interacting with others, which the sentence suggests John doesn't have available. Therefore, the most logical answer is "surf net," which can be done alone and doesn't involve watching television.
two eyes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the round things are a characteristic commonly found in humans. Two arms, ten fingers, and laying eggs are not round things and are not commonly associated with humans. Living forever is not a physical characteristic and is not a commonly known quality of humans. Two eyes, however, are round and are a well-known feature of humans.
action | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject is trying to figure out what course of action to take in order to complete a task or achieve a goal. Contemplation typically involves thinking deeply and pondering different options or ideas, but in this case, the end goal is to take some sort of action. The other choices may be related to contemplation or thought processes, but they do not necessarily imply a specific action or decision-making process.
discount store | Knowledge: The word "cheap" suggests that the book is being sold at a lower price than usual. Discount stores are known for selling products at a reduced price compared to regular retail stores, and they often have a wide selection of books available. The other options - desk, grocery shop, house, and antique store - are not typical places to buy books or to find them at a reduced price.
live | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was still able to continue living despite the difficulty they faced with breathing. Therefore, the correct answer is "live." The other options ("choke," "give up," "sigh," and "cough") do not fit the context of the sentence and are not relevant to the person's ability to continue living.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the housing options in the midwest are plain and lacking in interesting architecture. To find houses with more unique and appealing architecture, the best option would likely be to look for areas outside of the midwest that are known for their interesting architecture. "Countryside" could be a good option for this since it suggests areas outside of urban centers which may have more unique and interesting housing options. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where to look for interesting architecture.
continue to grow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that grass needs water and light to survive and thrive. If it is given these resources, it will continue to grow. The other options are unlikely outcomes of healthy grass given proper resources.
war zone | Knowledge: Soldiers are typically associated with war, so it is logical to assume that they would be found in a place where fighting is taking place, such as a war zone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
new realization | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's belief has been challenged by new information and they have had a change in perspective, which is commonly referred to as a new realization. Disappointment and wanting more are unlikely outcomes of receiving new information, while a heat wave and joy have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
phoning | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe needed to communicate something important to Marsha before she left home, but he forgot to do so. He then spent an hour "desperately" doing something, which suggests that he was under pressure to get in touch with her. Phoning would be a logical option in this scenario, as it would allow Joe to reach Marsha quickly and convey the important information to her. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tool shed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question keeps all their equipment in a specific place, which is likely to be a storage area. The options "garage" and "hardware store" don't fit the context of the sentence, as they are not typically places where someone would store their personal equipment. "Tool kit" and "toolbox" suggest that the saw would be in a portable container, but the sentence specifically mentions an outdoor location, so "tool shed" is the most appropriate option.
refuse | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone is expressing a negative attitude towards something they don't want. "Reject" and "detest" also convey negative attitudes, but "reject" suggests a more active action, like denying or turning away, while "detest" suggests a strong, emotional dislike. "Annoy" does not fit the sentence's context of expressing a negative attitude towards something, and "stockpile" is unrelated. "Refuse" is the most appropriate choice as it conveys a passive action of not accepting or declining something.
near a border of a country | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Lisa saw a sign while driving that indicated she was near a border. This could refer to a state border within the USA or a country border if Lisa was traveling internationally. The options "street," "every city," and "countryside" do not provide any further information about a possible border. "Texas" could be a possible location if Lisa was driving on a highway in Texas, but it does not necessarily indicate she is near a border.
relaxing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the doctor is taking a break from their work and therefore is not likely to be found in a professional setting such as medical school or the emergency room. The choices of a nursing home or a golf course may be possible, but from the context of the sentence, the doctor is more likely to be engaged in a leisure activity on their day off, hence the option of relaxing makes the most sense.
battlefield | Knowledge: An injured soldier is most likely to be found on a battlefield, where they would have been engaged in combat. The other options do not make sense in the context of an injured soldier, as they are either modes of transportation (helicopter, armored car) or a political location (White House).
property | Knowledge: A yard is typically a part of a property, which refers to a piece of land that is owned by an individual or entity. A subdivision is a type of real estate development where a large piece of land is divided into smaller lots, each of which may contain a property with a yard. A neighborhood is a community of people who live in a particular area, which may or may not have yards. A file is a collection of documents or data stored on a computer. A city is a large urban area with its own government and infrastructure, which may contain many properties with yards but is not typically considered a part of a property in the same way that a yard is.
developed land | Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes areas that are located near highways and have been built up with infrastructure and buildings. "Subways" and "desert" do not fit this description, and "mexico" and "atlas" are not relevant to the context of the question. "Developed land" is a commonly used term to describe areas that have experienced construction and urbanization.
stretch | Knowledge: The word "elastic" implies that the material has the ability to stretch and then return to its original shape. The other choices, such as "rebound," "recoil," and "bounce," also imply movement or a return to a previous state, but do not necessarily indicate the ability to stretch. "Underwear" is a type of clothing and is not related to the properties of elasticity.
awake | Knowledge: Getting out of bed typically refers to the act of physically leaving the bed after waking up from sleep. Therefore, the correct answer is 'awake'. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
spit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ice in the person's mouth is causing discomfort, and spitting it out is a common way to get rid of it. The other options do not provide a logical solution for dealing with the cold sensation in the mouth.
unique | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the inspector believed the item in question was not an original work by the artist, but rather a copy. The word "unique" implies that the original artwork had particular qualities or characteristics that set it apart from other works, and therefore are absent in the alleged copy. The other options do not provide any relevant or meaningful information in the context of the sentence.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the garbage men are not properly disposing of the garbage and that it is ending up somewhere it should not be. The most logical answer to this would be on the street, as it is a common place where garbage can accumulate when not properly collected. The sewer and landfill options do not make sense as the sentence suggests the garbage is not being properly disposed of, while the other two options are essentially the same thing as a landfill.
embarrassment | Knowledge: Perjury is the act of lying under oath or providing false information in a legal setting. It is considered a serious offense and can lead to penalties such as indictment, going to jail, or mistrial. However, the question is asking about how someone might feel, not what the consequences are. It is likely that someone committing perjury would feel embarrassed or guilty for lying in a legal setting and risking the consequences that may follow. Tension and penalty are also possible emotions, but embarrassment is the most likely answer based on the context of the question.
deny | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is punishing the student by not allowing them to go to recess. The word "punish" and the phrase "not allowing them to go to recess" indicate that the teacher is taking away a privilege. The word "deny" means to refuse to grant or allow something, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the action of the teacher in this situation.
toy store | Knowledge: The question asks about the best place to get a bicycle for a child, which implies that the focus is on finding a bike that is suitable and safe for a child. Toy stores typically specialize in selling toys and children's products, including bicycles that are designed for children. Other options like fun, street, university, and garage do not seem like appropriate places to purchase a child's bicycle.
Atlantic ocean | Knowledge: The great white shark is most commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly along the coasts of North America and South Africa. While they can be found in other oceans, such as the Pacific and Indian, the highest concentration of these sharks is in the Atlantic. Sea World is a theme park and not a location where great white sharks can be found in the wild. The Gulf of Mexico is a warm, shallow sea and does not provide the suitable habitat for great white sharks.
new contacts | Knowledge: The phrase "held at work" suggests that the party is related to the work environment, which implies that attending the party may be an opportunity to make new contacts or network with colleagues. While it's possible to have fun and make new friends at the party, the primary goal in a work-related setting would likely be to establish professional connections. The option of doing drugs is inappropriate and unrelated to the context of the question.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is likely in his own home when he needs to shave, which would make the medicine cabinet the most likely place for him to keep his disposable razor. A medicine cabinet is often located in or near a bathroom and is used to store personal hygiene items such as razors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Disneyland | Knowledge: This answer can be derived from common knowledge about popular tourist attractions in America. Disneyland is known for its theme park attractions, including character meet and greets with Disney princesses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
see exhibits | Knowledge: The word "curiosity" implies a desire to explore and discover new things, which suggests that James was interested in seeing the various exhibits at the fair. The other options do not have a clear connection to curiosity or exploring new things, and therefore are unlikely to be the correct answer.
learn new | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the individual enjoys reading and has likely read a lot. Since the options are related to the context, "learn new" is the most appropriate choice. "Travel new places" may be tempting, but it does not necessarily follow from the fact that the individual likes reading books. Similarly, "learn to read" does not make sense in this context, and "enjoyable" and "bored" are adjectives that do not relate to the sentence in any meaningful way.
fear death | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the person is at a railroad crossing. Looking both ways before crossing a railroad is a common safety measure to avoid getting hit by a train. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "fear death." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
freeway | Knowledge: Freeways are designed to accommodate high speeds and are often the fastest way to travel on roads. Car dealerships and car shows are locations where cars are displayed, not driven, and therefore speed is not a factor. "Superb" is not a location and is not related to driving speeds. Parking lots are typically limited in speed due to pedestrian traffic and safety concerns.
hide from | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people planning the surprise party saw a car approaching and quickly tried to hide from the guest of honor, indicating that the party was meant to be a surprise. The other options do not fit with the context of hiding and surprising someone, such as sending flowers, being sneaky, or singing.
introduce yourself | Knowledge: The verb "give" implies that the answer is an action or something tangible that is presented to someone when they meet others. Out of the choices provided, only "introduce yourself" fits this description as it is a common social convention to introduce oneself when meeting new people. The other choices may factor into a meeting, but they are not directly given to someone in the same way that an introduction is.
university | Knowledge: Super computers are advanced computing machines that are typically used for scientific research, simulation, and data analysis. While they may be used in various settings, universities are a common place to find them due to the research and academic needs of faculty and students. Libraries and post offices do not typically have super computers, and while technical stores may sell technology products, they may not necessarily have super computers readily available. Large cities are also not necessarily a common place to find super computers.
head south | Knowledge: Many bird species migrate to warmer climates during the winter to avoid harsh weather conditions and to find sources of food. The phrase "head south" suggests that the birds are likely to fly in a southerly direction during this time. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as it is already assumed that the birds are capable of flying and spreading their wings. Learning to fly is something that birds do as fledglings, not as adults. Flying north may be appropriate for some species during the spring and summer months, but it would not make sense for them to do so during the winter when temperatures are cold. Flying high may be an option for some birds, but it is not a necessary or distinguishing behavior for winter migration.
overpopulation | Knowledge: The phrase "procreating too much" suggests that the question is about the potential negative consequences of having too many children. "Overpopulation" is a logical answer choice, as having too many people in an area can lead to various problems such as overcrowding, resource depletion, and environmental degradation. The other options do not directly address the issue of overpopulation.
people helped | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sarah loves giving assistance and doesn't expect anything in return. This suggests that Sarah is a compassionate person who values helping others. The option "people helped" directly relates to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sarah did not enjoy driving cars, and that the traffic caused her a lot of something. Based on common knowledge and experiences, it is likely that what the traffic caused Sarah was stress, as traffic can be frustrating, time-consuming, and can lead to anxiety and agitation. The other options, such as car crashes, death, and happiness, are not likely to be connected to the sentence, as they are not related to Sarah's dislike of driving and the traffic.
change in leadership | Knowledge: A coup-de-etat refers to a violent overthrow of a government or leader, often by a group within the existing power structure. The sentence suggests that the motive behind the coup is to change society, which implies a desire for a change in leadership. The other options are not specifically related to a takeover of government, and do not make sense in the given context.
get pregnant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman has a problem with alcohol consumption, which can have negative effects on a developing fetus if she were to become pregnant. Doctors commonly advise women who are regular alcohol users to avoid getting pregnant, as it can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and other health complications for the baby. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
eat eggs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two people were getting hungry, which implies that they were looking for food. The most likely option from the provided choices is "eat eggs," which is a commonly available and easy-to-prepare food that can be found at many quick stops. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to hunger or the quick stop environment.
wash hands | Knowledge: It is important to wash your hands after using the bathroom, especially after urinating, to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria to yourself and others. Washing your legs or zipping your pants would not be relevant to this situation. Flushing the toilet is also important for sanitation but does not apply to the personal hygiene aspect of the question. Eating should come after washing your hands to ensure you do not transfer any germs from your hands to your food.
sports complex | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the area being referred to is not just limited to the baseball stadium, but rather encompasses a larger space. The phrase "sports complex" suggests a large area that contains multiple sports facilities, such as baseball fields, basketball courts, and swimming pools. The other options, such as "peanut" or "major city," do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct.
go to prison | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that killing people is a criminal offense and will result in some form of punishment. Going to prison is a common consequence for committing murder or manslaughter, which is why it is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity of the crime or the legal consequences.
country club | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple joined a club that offered both golfing and spa treatments. While health centers and resorts may offer similar amenities, the context of the sentence specifically mentions golfing as the activity the man was engaged in. Country clubs are often associated with golfing and other leisure activities, making them the most likely choice for a club that offers both golfing and spa treatments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
meditation | Knowledge: Going into a trance is often associated with meditation, where the person intentionally enters a deep state of relaxation to achieve certain benefits such as stress reduction, heightened awareness, and spiritual connection. Going into a trance is not associated with feeling confused or having epilepsy, which are conditions that may result in an involuntary loss of consciousness. The options "nothing" and "meditate" are repetitive, and the correct answer is included in both options.
friend's house | Knowledge: Quiet conversation implies a more intimate setting where people can hear each other without raising their voices. A friend's house is a more private and personal space, as opposed to a party or stadium where there may be loud music or cheering. Dinner may also be a good option, depending on the restaurant or setting. The water cooler is usually a public area and not conducive to private conversations.
Virginia | Knowledge: The Blue Ridge Mountains are a range located in the southeastern United States, primarily extending through the states of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Roanoke City is located in Virginia, so that would be the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the location of Roanoke City or the Blue Ridge Mountains.
forest | Knowledge: The question asks for what covers the largest percentage of the Pacific Northwest, which implies a physical feature rather than a political boundary (such as the United States or British Columbia). The Pacific Northwest is known for its dense forests and the logging industry, making "forest" the most likely answer. Washington and Oregon are two states located in the Pacific Northwest, but they are not physical features that cover the area.
listen to music | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people use their iPhones to cope with their sadness. While some people may cry or watch tragic films, the more common activity associated with using phones to distract from negative emotions is listening to music. Listening to music is a widely popular way to relax and improve one's mood, especially with the accessibility of music streaming services on mobile devices. The other options do not match the context of using an iPhone to cope with sadness.
lie flat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was having difficulty getting up from bed, indicating that he may already be lying down. The phrase "arise" typically means to stand up from a sitting or lying position, indicating that Billy was not sitting down at the time. "Fall down" and "get down" involve movement in a downward direction, which does not fit the context of the sentence. "Lay down" may be a possibility, but it is less likely since the sentence suggests that Billy was already having difficulty getting up, indicating that he was already lying down.
think about things | Knowledge: The word "cogitating" is derived from the Latin word "cogitare" which means "to think" or "to ponder." Thus, the correct answer is likely to be an option that indicates a process of thinking or contemplating. "Sit comfortably" and "enjoy" do not accurately describe the act of thinking. "Might understand" may suggest a possibility of comprehension but not necessarily the act of thinking. "Brain work" is close in meaning but not as precise as "think about things," which better captures the meaning of cogitating.
electricity | Knowledge: When a tree hits power lines, it often results in power outages. Therefore, a person would be missing electricity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
claw | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a cat's nervousness can lead them to exhibit certain behaviors, one of which is mentioned in the question. Clawing is a common behavior seen in cats when they are stressed or anxious. Growling and purring are also behaviors that cats can exhibit under various emotional states, but they do not necessarily indicate nervousness. Drinking water and thinking do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lawbook | Knowledge: The question specifically asks where a lawyer would look for a rule they are governed by, which is most likely to be found in a lawbook. A lawbook contains the laws, regulations, and rules that govern the legal profession and are essential for lawyers to know and follow. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or the legal profession.
dance | Knowledge: The word "excitement" suggests a high level of energy and enthusiasm, and dancing is a common way for people to express such emotions. Going somewhere, visiting a library, or attending a music festival may also be exciting activities, but they do not necessarily involve physically showing excitement in the same way that dancing does. Expressing information is also not likely to be associated with excitement.
obesity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having lunch too many times can result in a negative outcome. Since feeling full and feeling satisfied are both normal outcomes after having lunch, they can be ruled out. Also, dying is an extreme outcome that is unlikely to happen just from having lunch too many times. Digestion is a normal process after having food, so it cannot be the answer. Obesity, however, is a well-known health concern that can arise from consuming an excessive amount of food, including lunch.
coffee | Knowledge: Beans are commonly used to make coffee, which is a popular beverage around the world. While beans can certainly be used in cooking or boiling, these choices do not fit the context of the question, as the question is specifically asking about a drink. Food store and cooking pot may be tangentially related to the question, but they are not direct answers to what beans are typically used to make in a drink.
rural area | Knowledge: Ponds are more commonly found in rural areas, which are typically characterized by low population density and a high proportion of natural landscapes. Ponds may be found in meadows and countryside areas as well, but they are less common in forested areas where bodies of water such as streams and rivers are more prevalent. Therefore, it is more likely that the pond in this scenario is located in a rural area rather than the other options.
start walking |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of standing up and putting one leg in front of the other repeatedly is a precursor to something else happening. Starting to walk is the most logical conclusion, as it involves putting one foot in front of the other repeatedly in order to move forward. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
shaving kit | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James was looking for his razor, which is typically kept in a shaving kit. The fact that he also found cream and a small comb further supports this idea, as these are commonly used for shaving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cotton candy | Knowledge: Carnivals are known for offering a variety of sweet treats, including cotton candy. Cotton candy is a common carnival snack made from spun sugar that is often brightly colored and served on a stick. The other options, such as "own house," "kitchen," and "meaningful work," are not related to carnival treats and do not make sense in the context of the question. "English house" may be a red herring designed to distract the reader from the correct answer.
drug store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is where one can purchase a variety of items, such as notepads, condoms, and toothpaste, all in the same place. The most likely location that fits this description is a drug store or pharmacy, which typically carry a wide range of products, including health and personal care items, and often have a stationery section. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location in question is a Bavarian town, which narrows down the options to Germany and town. Rio de Janeiro is not located in Bavaria and dance dance dance and hotel do not provide any clues about the location. Thus, the correct answer is likely town.
capsule | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the doctor can prescribe antibiotics in different forms, and the question specifically asks for the type of antibiotic that might have a gel coating. Capsules are a common form of antibiotics that can have a gel coating to make them easier to swallow. The other options do not provide any information related to the potential presence of a gel coating.
backyard | Knowledge: A rosebush is a type of plant that is commonly grown in gardens or outdoor spaces. Flower beds and backyards are often places where people would plant rosebushes. A park or a ballpark might have landscaping that includes rosebushes, but it would be less likely that a person would plant one there themselves. "Outdoors" is too general of a term and doesn't provide enough context to determine the correct answer.
science lab | Knowledge: The word "analyze" implies a scientific or technical approach to examining something. The options "city hall," "anything," "fabric store," and "physical world" do not have a clear association with scientific analysis, while a "science lab" is a place specifically designed and equipped for conducting scientific experiments and analyzing materials.
small hole | Knowledge: A small hole is often a sign that a mouse has been in the house. Mice can fit through tiny spaces and will create small holes in walls or floors to gain access to different parts of a home. Cheese may be a food that attracts mice, but its presence alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of mice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the behavior or habits of mice.
run fast | Knowledge: The sentence provides information about dogs having four legs which indicates their physical ability. Dogs are known to be fast runners due to their four legs and muscular build. The other choices do not match the given information about dogs having four legs.
corner | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lamp is being placed in an area where two walls meet, which is commonly referred to as a corner. Placing the lamp on a desktop or in a bedroom does not necessarily require it to be in a corner, while placing it in an office or corner of a garden may be irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
hardware store | Knowledge: A hardware store typically sells a wide range of tools and equipment, including saws that customers can purchase and take home with them. A tool shed refers to a small storage facility for tools, while a toolbox or tool kit would only contain a limited selection of tools and generally would not include a saw. DIY stores may also sell saws, but they typically offer a broader range of products for various DIY projects, whereas a hardware store specializes in hardware tools and supplies.
jungle | Knowledge: A rosebush is a type of garden plant that is typically found in well-maintained outdoor spaces, such as backyards, flower beds or parks. However, a jungle is a natural environment that is typically characterized by dense vegetation consisting of a variety of trees, shrubs, and other plants - not a typical location for a cultivated rosebush. Therefore, it is unlikely to find a rosebush growing in a jungle.
Retina | Knowledge: Neuroepithelium is a type of tissue that contains nerve cells and is responsible for sensory perception. It is found in several parts of the body, such as the nasal cavity, inner ear, retina, and other areas. However, the question is asking specifically which part of the body is being used to read the text if you're human. The retina is the part of the eye that contains sensory receptors responsible for detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain to interpret visual information. Therefore, the correct answer is retina. The other options are not directly involved in reading text.
brainy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being described fits a stereotype, and that this is related to having thick glasses. This is a common association with the stereotype of the "nerd" or the "intellectual", which is often depicted with thick glasses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
loss of control  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going into a deep trance to purge the subconscious could have negative consequences such as loss of control. Going into a deep trance may involve letting go of conscious control in order to access the unconscious mind, which could potentially lead to a loss of control. Memory loss, closed eyes, confusion, and meditation epilepsy do not necessarily relate to the context of going into a deep trance to purge the subconscious.
livingroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are looking for a place to sit on a couch near their own home, which typically refers to the comfort of one's own living space. The other options, such as an apartment, bus stop, den, or neighbor's house, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not imply a sense of comfort or familiarity.
desk drawer | Knowledge: The question suggests that the clip will be used while working, which implies that it is related to office or desk work. The option "desk drawer" is the most logical answer as it is a common place to store office supplies like paper clips and is easily accessible while working at a desk. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
have fun | Knowledge: Playing sports is generally seen as a leisure activity that people engage in for entertainment and enjoyment. While winning may be an important goal for some individuals, most people play sports as a means of having fun and engaging in physical activity. Cheating is not considered a legitimate way of achieving success in sports, and running and earning an MBE are not typically associated with the primary objectives of participating in sports.
relax | Knowledge: Sitting down in front of a TV is commonly associated with relaxation and entertainment. Many people watch TV to unwind after a long day or to enjoy a favorite show or movie. "Can rest" is similar to relax but not as specific to the context of sitting down in front of a TV. "Meditate" and "fart" have no clear connection to the context of sitting down in front of a TV, and "drink" could be a reason for some, but doesn't apply to everyone.
drugstore | Knowledge: The question is asking where one can purchase sunglasses, which suggests that it is a retail location. The options "glovebox," "purse," "on your head," and "shirt pocket" are all locations where one might store sunglasses, but not necessarily purchase them. However, a drugstore is a common location to buy sunglasses, along with other items such as toiletries and medication.
sleepwalking | Knowledge: The mention of going into a trance suggests a state of altered consciousness, which can be associated with sleep disorders such as sleepwalking. Sleepwalking is a type of unconscious involuntary movement that occurs during the non-REM stage of sleep, often triggered by stress or sleep deprivation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
putting together  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah did not believe that the subject in question should be divided, indicating that they were once whole or together. The phrase "putting together" is commonly associated with creating something whole or complete, and thus would make sense in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
army corps | Knowledge: A bugle is a brass instrument traditionally used in military settings, particularly for communication and signaling. Army corps is the only answer choice that is directly related to the use of a bugle in a specific context. The other choices are not relevant to the question's context.
have imagination | Knowledge: The sentence implies that pretending involves using one's imagination, as it states that "to pretend you need something special." The other options do not relate to the idea of using imagination to create a pretend scenario. A cell phone, thinking, and having fun may all be involved in pretending, but they are not necessary factors in the way that having an imagination is. Day dreaming, while related to imagination, is too narrow a term to capture the general concept being described in the sentence.
desk | Knowledge: A lamp is a common accessory used for reading or working, and is usually placed on a surface that is near the person doing the task. The choices 'office' and 'bedroom' are too vague to give a clear indication of where the lamp should be placed. 'Desktop' is a similar option to 'desk' but may not be as commonly used in daily language. 'Corner' is too ambiguous and doesn't provide enough context to determine where the lamp should be placed.
hockey game | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Donny enjoys going up against other people in a violent context, which is often associated with contact sports such as hockey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they relate to different types of violence and conflict.
at hotel | Knowledge: The other options, such as "outback," "neighbor's house," and "waterfall," do not typically have swimming pools. A gym may have a pool, but it is not guaranteed, and it may only be available to members. A hotel, on the other hand, commonly has a pool available for guests to use.
lack of sleep | Knowledge: The term "procreating" implies that Billy and June were trying to have a child or children. The sentence suggests that the process was enjoyable, but there would be an uncomfortable end result. The option "lack of sleep" is a common issue that parents face after having a child, as newborns require frequent feeding and care throughout the night. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
make sex | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is trying to conceive a child, which typically involves engaging in sexual intercourse. Planning to marry, communicating, sleeping in separate rooms, and dancing do not necessarily have a direct connection to conceiving a child.
time off work | Knowledge: Secular holidays are usually associated with taking time off work or school, so they are not typically eternal or frequent. They are scheduled in advance, so they are not unpredictable, and they are usually only observed for a short term, such as a day or a weekend. The option "time off work" makes the most sense in this context, and is supported by common knowledge about secular holidays.
procrastination | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim waited until the last minute to start his essay, indicating a tendency towards procrastination. Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing a task, often resulting in added stress and poor quality work. The other options do not have any clear connection to Jim's behavior of starting his essay late.
disneyland | Knowledge: A dream vacation for children is likely to be a fun and exciting experience. Disneyland, a popular amusement park with various rides and attractions, fits this description. The other options, such as a zoo or a museum, may be interesting for some children, but do not typically have the same level of excitement and entertainment as Disneyland. School and toy store are unlikely to be considered dream vacation destinations.
amount to | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe and Mac were concerned about making a significant impact in their future, as they wanted to be important. The phrase "amount to" implies that they wanted to achieve something significant and meaningful, rather than just making money or doing well academically. The other options do not offer a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest a desire to make a meaningful impact.
heart | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the aorta, which is commonly known as the largest artery in the human body. The aorta originates from the left ventricle of the heart and travels down to the abdomen, providing oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. Therefore, the correct answer is heart. The other options do not accurately describe the location of the aorta.
meeting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam is presenting to his partners, which implies a business or work-related context. The other options, such as a theatre or movie showing, do not fit this context. A conference may be a possibility, but it is a larger-scale event, whereas a meeting is more likely to involve a smaller group like Sam's partners.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing baseball is something that brings joy and satisfaction to children, which is most closely associated with the idea of happiness. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - sore muscles, injury, and errors are all negative consequences that may come from playing sports, while sadness is unlikely to be a common emotion associated with playing baseball.
messy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair gel has an unpleasant odor, which may be a result of it being too messy. Hair gel can become messy if too much is applied, or if it is not evenly distributed throughout the hair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laundry soap | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about what is used to wash clothes, not just any general item related to laundry. The context suggests that detergent or soap is needed to properly clean clothes, and "laundry soap" is a common term used to refer to this type of product. The other options, such as using just water or relying on time alone, are not effective methods of washing clothes.
sorrow | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the suspect showed little emotion during his sentencing, but did express remorse for the effects of his actions on the victim's families. "Sorrow" is a feeling commonly associated with regret or remorse, which makes it the most appropriate choice among the options given. The other options are either not related to emotions or do not fit the context of the sentence.
forest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the creek is located in a specific area that is characterized by trees, which is a characteristic commonly associated with forests. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
eat healthy food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to lose mass, which means they need to focus on reducing their calorie intake. Eating healthy food is an effective way to support weight loss by providing the body with essential nutrients, while avoiding processed and high-calorie foods. The other options are related to general health and fitness, but do not directly address the goal of losing mass.
universe | Knowledge: The question is asking for an overarching category that the world belongs to, and the term "universe" is commonly used to describe everything that exists, including all galaxies, solar systems, and celestial objects. "Galaxy" refers specifically to a collection of stars and planets, while "solar system" refers to the collection of planets and other objects that orbit around a star. "Sky" and "space" are more general terms and do not necessarily encompass everything in existence.
bus station | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was heading to another place, which implies that he was likely planning on traveling a longer distance. A duffle bag is a common type of luggage that is easy to carry, which suggests that James was not traveling by car or plane. The options "store," "sporting goods store," and "locker room" do not suggest any connection to travel or transportation. "Transit" is a more general term and could refer to any mode of transportation, but "bus station" specifically suggests someone walking to a central hub for catching a bus to their destination.
a cut | Knowledge: The question is asking about where a drop of blood comes out of, which is typically associated with bleeding from a wound or cut. Veins and the human body are too broad and do not necessarily imply bleeding, and a needle typically causes a controlled and intentional extraction of blood rather than accidental bleeding from a cut. A person is also too broad and does not provide specific information about where the blood is coming from.
night sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people were able to see the moon surrounded by stars, implying that they were observing it from Earth. As the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it is not likely to have been seen from outer space, air, or the universe. The context also mentions stars, which are typically visible in the night sky. "Magic" is not a plausible answer as the sentence suggests a factual observation.
store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the merchant needed a physical location to sell his goods, which is commonly done through a store. A business or mall may contain multiple stores, but the sentence specifically talks about the merchant building something. A house is not typically used for selling goods, and "sell goods" does not describe a specific type of building.
church | Knowledge: Sundays are typically associated with religious observance, with many people attending church on this day. The other options do not align with this context, and going to jail or staying at home may not be something one chooses to do voluntarily. Going out to eat at a restaurant or spending time with loved ones are possible options for a Sunday activity, but they do not fit the context of the question as well as attending church.
restaurant | Knowledge: The question is asking for the closest place outside of one's own home where a grill can be found. While a backyard or neighbor's house may have a grill, they are still considered part of someone's home. A restaurant, on the other hand, is a public place where grills are commonly found in the kitchen for cooking food. Barbeque could also be a viable option, but it is relatively vague and can refer to both a cooking method and a social gathering. "These twos places are cannot be found" is a grammatically incorrect option and can be eliminated.
zoo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are easy-to-see creatures in a city, which is a reference to a zoo. Zoos are designed to showcase a variety of animals in a confined space for easy viewing. The other options, such as forest, library, woods or black lagoon, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are unlikely to showcase a variety of animals within a city.
say hi | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam and his friend did something to acknowledge each other's presence, but nothing specific is mentioned beyond exchanging greetings. "Say hi" is a common way to greet someone when you see them, and it would be a likely choice in a casual meeting like this one. While other options like "shake hands" or "have coffee" could also potentially happen during a meeting, the sentence does not provide enough information to support those choices. "Say goodbye" is not appropriate because the sentence implies that Sam and his friend are just starting their meeting, so they wouldn't be saying goodbye yet.
make art | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to impress his family and the most logical option that would impress people is to make something creative like art. The other options like believing in god, leaving or coming home or going out do not necessarily imply that he would impress his family by doing those things.
coma | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had a period of time where he was not conscious, but does not imply that he died or experienced forgetfulness. The fact that a year had passed also suggests that it was a prolonged period of unconsciousness, ruling out the options of falling down or dreaming which are typically much shorter experiences. Therefore, the most likely option is that John was in a coma.
conclusion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that discovering truth is a part of serious research, and it would come during a specific part of the research process. The conclusion is the logical end of research, where researchers analyze the data they collected, draw insights, and make conclusions based on their findings. Therefore, the logical choice would be "conclusion," as it directly relates to the idea of finding the truth. The other options, such as "sick," "pain," "relief," or "happiness," do not have any clear connection to the process of research.
get | Knowledge: Greed is a desire or excessive hunger for something, usually material possessions or wealth. "Get" is the correct answer since someone who is greedy wants to acquire more than they need or deserve. The other options do not make sense in the context of greed.
demonstration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something external prevented the person from leaving work, and one of the choices that could potentially block someone in the street would be a demonstration. Demonstrations often involve a large group of people gathering in public spaces to protest or raise awareness about an issue, which could lead to blocked roads or restricted movement. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cactus | Knowledge: Cacti are known for their ability to survive in arid and dry environments, making them a popular choice for people who want low-maintenance plants. Cacti are adapted to store water in their tissues, which allows them to go for long periods without being watered. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
poop | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when birds fly overhead, something unpleasant happens to Sarah. The word "covered" suggests that it is a physical substance that lands on her, and the word "loved" implies that it is not something she enjoys. The word "poop" is commonly associated with birds and is a logical choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get punished | Knowledge: Killing people is a serious crime that is punishable by law in most jurisdictions. The sentence suggests that there will be consequences for killing people, which will likely involve some form of punishment. Options such as vengeance and joy do not make sense in this context as they imply an emotional response rather than a legal consequence. Going to prison and going to jail are similar options that could be correct, but get punished is a more general and accurate answer that covers all possible types of punishment for the crime.
State park | Knowledge: A park is a public outdoor area that people use for various recreational activities, such as walking, jogging, picnicking or relaxing. Many parks have benches strategically placed throughout the area, providing a convenient spot for people to take a break or sit down to enjoy the scenery. A state park is a specific type of park that is usually maintained by a state government to preserve natural areas, historical sites, or other features of interest. The other options do not have the same association with the presence of benches.
exception | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lead character is confident and has a tendency to defy expectations. He then makes a quip about "every rule having its exception," which means he believes that there are always some situations where a rule does not apply. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
England | Knowledge: The word "tearoom" is often associated with England, where the tradition of taking tea in the afternoon was popularized in the 19th century by Queen Victoria. While tearooms can be found in many parts of the world today, England is where they first became popular and are still an important part of British culture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
brain tumor | Knowledge: Headaches can have many causes, including physical trauma such as a fall, mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, emotional stress such as being made fun of, and incorrect information such as a false diagnosis. However, a brain tumor is a known medical condition that can cause frequent or severe headaches, making it the correct answer to the question. It is important to consult a healthcare provider to accurately diagnose and treat any potential causes of headaches.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: Borrowing sugar is a common gesture between neighbors, as they are often in close proximity and may need to ask for small favors from time to time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the contextual knowledge of borrowing sugar, such as internet or buildings. Apartments could work, but it would not be specific enough as it could be multiple apartments or complexes. End of line is not relevant to the question.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone could give you a plate with a grape on it, which implies that it is a dish or a meal. The most likely place to receive a prepared dish with a garnish like a grape would be in a restaurant. The other options, such as a grocery store or a food store, do not typically serve prepared dishes.
lowered | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the stream had not been flowing for a while due to a drought. As a result, the water levels would have likely decreased or lowered. The other choices do not capture the same sense of water levels decreasing or stopping. "Stagnant" and "stagnate" suggest that the water was not moving, but do not necessarily imply a decrease in levels. "Hold up" and "stopping" suggest a sudden cessation of flow, rather than a gradual decrease.
sea | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the person is enjoying sunshine on the beach, implying that they are physically present at a beach. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be something that is commonly associated with beaches. One of the common features of a beach is a view of the sea, which makes it the most probable option. The other options, such as windowsill, sunbathers, disneyland, and summer, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
stop speaking | Knowledge: To listen effectively, you must first stop speaking in order to give the speaker your full attention. Continuing to speak during a conversation can be distracting and prevent you from fully understanding what the speaker is trying to communicate. While it is important to concentrate on the sounds and words being spoken, the first step is to simply stop speaking and focus on the speaker. The other options are less likely to be the first thing you need to do in order to listen effectively.
swallow | Knowledge: The question is asking about an action related to drinking liquids. Swallowing is the action of moving liquids or food from the mouth to the stomach through a series of muscle movements in the throat and esophagus. The other options are not related to drinking liquids. Needing to urinate is a bodily function related to excreting waste, vomiting is the involuntary expulsion of stomach contents, having fun is a subjective experience not related to drinking liquids, and sickness may be a result of drinking something harmful or contaminated, but it is not an action related to drinking.
new jersey | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Hoboke, which is a city in New Jersey. Therefore, it is likely that the toll road mentioned is also in or near New Jersey. The other options do not have any clear connection to Hoboke or to toll roads in that region.
house | Knowledge: The question is asking about where a furnace typically heats, which suggests that it is a household appliance. "House" and "basement" are the most likely choices, as furnaces are typically located in basements or crawl spaces and heat the entire house. The other options, such as "antarctic" and "cellar," do not make sense in the context of the question.
female | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that a stud bull was brought in to breed with a prize winning animal, and the term "stud" typically refers to a male animal that is used for breeding purposes. Furthermore, the choice of "female" as an option implies that the prize winning animal is a female. The other options, such as "horse" and "feeble", do not make sense in the context of breeding with a bull. "Bullbleep" is not a valid option as it is not a real word.
back alley | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that a cat is hunting for a mouse, which is most likely to be found in a back alley. Back alleys often have a lot of hiding places and small spaces where mice can hide, making them an ideal location for cats to hunt. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys nature and likes to spend time in green spaces, particularly by a pond. Parks are public spaces that often have ponds or lakes, and are commonly visited by city-dwellers for relaxation and recreation. The other options, such as forests or countryside, do not fit the context of a city setting.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence describes a scenario where a hard piece of rubber, most likely a puck, was deflected off a stick and struck a fan. This type of incident is common in sports that involve the use of sticks and pucks, such as ice hockey. The use of the word "sporting event" in the answer choice suggests that this incident could happen in any sport that involves the use of equipment that can potentially fly off during play. The other options, such as living room and football stadium, do not fit the context of the sentence.
power outage | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the electricity is completely out in the house, which suggests that it is not a localized issue like a short fuse, shock, or a fire caused by an electrical malfunction. The man suspects the cause of the power outage, indicating that it is not a scheduled maintenance or maintenance-related issue that would likely be communicated in advance. The correct answer is power outage because it is the most logical and probable cause of a sudden loss of electricity in the house.
wait for | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is an action that some people do their whole life in order to show their love. The verb "wait for" implies that these people may be waiting for someone or something, which could suggest a romantic or emotional context. "Live life" and "entertain" do not have a clear connection to the idea of waiting for love, while "emotion affection" is not a grammatically correct phrase. "Kiss" could be a way to express love, but it does not fit the phrasing of the sentence as well as "wait for."
None of the choices are correct, as the question is not specific enough and does not provide enough context to generate a feasible answer. It would be helpful to have additional information about what specific policy or action the question is referring to.
disneyland | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people mentioned were wearing mouse ears and purchased balloons, both of which are commonly associated with the Disney theme parks. The mention of Southern California further supports this idea, as Disneyland is located in Anaheim, CA. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
drive car | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah had a desire to do something that she was not yet old enough to do. The options "marry", "dress himself", "drive train", and "ball stopped" do not fit the context of the sentence. The only option that makes sense is "drive car", as it is a common activity that requires a certain age and licensure.
homework | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was not good at testing himself, so it would be best for him to continue doing something else instead. The most likely option is his homework, as this is a common task that students are expected to complete regularly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tokio | Knowledge: The question is asking for the location of the most authentic Japanese restaurant, which implies that the restaurant must be located in Japan. Therefore, the correct answer is Tokio (Tokyo), which is the capital of Japan and is known for having a wide variety of authentic Japanese restaurants. The other options may have Japanese restaurants, but they are not necessarily known for being the most authentic.
shame | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did something wrong, specifically committing perjury. Perjury is a serious offense and can have legal consequences like penalties, arrests, and going to jail. However, the question asks for the emotion that John felt. Based on the context, John's emotional response is likely related to the fact that he did not like committing perjury, which indicates that he recognized it as a morally wrong act. Shame is an emotion commonly associated with feeling guilty or embarrassed about a wrongdoing, making it the most likely answer. Tension does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
near end | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the story has reached the highest point of tension or excitement, which is often called the climax. It also indicates that the story is not quite finished yet, since it is only near the end. The other choices, such as "floor" or "falling down," have no relation to the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect. "End badly" might be a possibility, but it is not a sure thing based on the information given in the sentence.
war | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that officers will use a pistol to shoot deserters, which is a military term referring to a soldier who abandons their duty or post. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to military operations, and "war" is the only option that fits this description. The other options, such as "police officer's belt" and "pants," are not related to military activities.
toolbox | Knowledge: A saw is a common tool used in woodworking and other DIY tasks. It is typically stored with other tools in a toolbox or tool kit, which makes it easily accessible when needed. While a hardware store may sell saws, it is not a place to store them. Similarly, a tool shed or storage area may be used to store larger tools or equipment, but a saw is small enough to be kept in a toolbox.
tree tops | Knowledge: Monkeys are arboreal creatures, meaning they live primarily in trees. This makes tree tops a logical choice for where they would hang out. Additionally, the other options do not necessarily apply to all monkeys - for example, monkeys in zoos do not necessarily "hang out" but rather are kept in enclosures. South Africa and tropical areas may be habitats for certain types of monkeys, but not all. The great outdoors is too broad and could apply to a variety of animals, not just monkeys.
be excited | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cats have a particular reaction when they are near water, and "be excited" is the most likely choice based on common knowledge about cats. Many cats enjoy playing with water or watching it, and some even enjoy swimming. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are unrelated to cats.
carnival | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the celebration in question involves both food and games, which is a characteristic commonly associated with carnivals. Carnivals typically involve a lot of noise from the various games and attractions, which explains why the sentence mentions "plenty of noise." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
use television | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about how to satisfy curiosity about a new show, which suggests that the show is likely intended for television viewing. Using television would be a logical way to access and watch the show. The other options do not provide a clear or relevant means of satisfying curiosity about a new show.
mall | Knowledge: The other options listed all suggest a setting where a formal dining area may be expected. "Coming together" could refer to events such as weddings, where formal dining is often part of the celebration. A "supper club" is a location specifically designed for dining out, often with a dress code that requires more formal attire. Cruise ships often have formal dinners as part of the cruise experience. Even in a home setting, some individuals may choose to have a formal dining area for special occasions. In contrast, a mall is not typically associated with formal dining experiences.
advance into battle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the soldier needed a deeper level of motivation, which is likely to come from a feeling of hatred towards the enemy. However, for the squad member, all it took was orders, indicating that they were willing to follow commands, and didn't necessarily require a personal motivation such as hatred. This makes "advance into battle" the most likely choice as it relates directly to following orders in a military context. The other options may be related to combat, but they do not match the specific context of the sentence.
calluses | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running in bad shoes can cause something painful, which may be a physical condition or injury. Among the choices, calluses are the most likely because they are a common result of wearing poorly fitting shoes or shoes that have worn out. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy had too much Mexican food and was unable to catch his flight as a result. This implies that he was experiencing some sort of physical discomfort or illness, which is commonly associated with overeating or consuming spicy foods. The fact that he missed his flight suggests that he was unable to leave the location where he had eaten the food, and the most likely place for him to have been stuck would be the bathroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
arrest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person became intoxicated and was then sent to prison, which implies that they engaged in some form of illegal behavior. The word "arrest" relates to this idea and makes the most sense as a consequence of such behavior. The other options are not directly related or do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
hired help | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the term used by Joan is less polite than "servant," suggesting that it may be a more negative or derogatory term. The option "in charge" has a positive connotation, and "freedom" and "rich person" do not relate to the context of the sentence. "Free person" could be a possibility, but it does not convey any negativity. "Hired help," however, is a term commonly used to refer to domestic workers or servants, and has a negative connotation.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat was bothering James by persistently staying near him when he was trying to focus on his work. The answer choices that have nothing to do with being inside the house or keeping close proximity to James (like microwave, meat loaf, or outside) can be eliminated. The choices that are more likely to be indoor areas, like bedroom or backyard, suggest a closer proximity and make sense in the context of the sentence. However, since the cat is clearly annoying James and entering his private workspace, the most likely answer is the bedroom.
marching band | Knowledge: The drum is commonly associated with marching bands as it provides the beat and rhythm for the group to march in time to. While drums can be used in other types of musical organizations, such as rock bands or symphony orchestras, the sentence specifically mentions the "key part" of the musical organization, which implies that the organization is primarily known for its use of the drum. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
drawer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is looking for a disposable or low-quality saucer to use for cat food, which is more likely to be found in a drawer for miscellaneous items rather than a specific cabinet or tea room. The other options are either too formal or not relevant to the context of the sentence.
make people laugh | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person wants to cheer up a group that is feeling down. Making someone laugh has been shown to have a positive effect on mood and can lift people's spirits. Socializing and meeting people may not necessarily cheer up the group if they are already feeling down, and meeting a friend is too specific and may not be an option for the person trying to cheer up the group. Telling jokes is related to making people laugh, but not everyone enjoys jokes and they may not be appropriate in all situations.
harm's way | Knowledge: The sentence implies that whatever "this" is, it is dangerous and something that should be avoided. "Harm's way" is a common expression used to describe a situation or location that poses a potential risk or danger to an individual. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
exercise | Knowledge: The sentence mentions jumping over a rope, which is a common activity in jump rope, an exercise that involves continuous jumping while swinging the rope under and over the feet. It is a popular form of exercise for children and adults alike and is considered an effective cardiovascular workout. The other options, such as headaches, broken, or fun, do not seem to have any direct connection to the context of the sentence. Getting warm could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough to be a correct answer.
garden | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is admiring an apple tree in a quiet and intimate setting. The choices "meadow" and "park" suggest open spaces that are often busy and less intimate, while "Idaho" and "Rhode Island" are geographic locations that do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Garden" is the most logical choice, as it is a small, intimate space that is often associated with trees and plants.
car door | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the answer refers to a type of door that is opened and closed when driving to a store. Among the choices, only "car door" fits this description. The other options may be doors found in homes or buildings, but they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the sentence mentions "oil" as a solution to fix a squeaky hinge, which is a common maintenance item for car doors.
windy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the calm seas are about to change because their sails filled, which indicates an increase in wind speed. The word "windy" is the only option that describes a change in wind conditions, while the others are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
controlling bleeding | Knowledge: A tourniquet is a medical device used to constrict blood flow in a limb or extremity in order to control bleeding. While it may be used in a hospital or ambulance setting, it is also commonly included in emergency kits for use in the event of accidents or injuries in remote or outdoor locations. The other options - ghetto, hospital, ambulance - are not related to the use of a tourniquet.
machine part | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wanted to fix their car, which implies that they needed a specific part to repair it. Therefore, the correct answer is machine part. The other options do not relate to car repair and are not logical choices.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to eat outside of their own home, which eliminates the option of "own home." The word "dining room" typically refers to a space within a restaurant or hotel where people can sit down and eat their meals, which makes "restaurant" and "hotel" likely options. "Mansion" does not fit the context of the sentence and is not typically associated with dining rooms. However, there is a typo in "resteraunt", so the correct answer is "restaurant."
Mexico | Knowledge: The question is asking about the origin of cuisine served in a Mexican restaurant. Since Mexican cuisine is characterized by dishes with flavors and ingredients indigenous to Mexico, it would make sense that the cuisine comes from Mexico itself. Tex-Mex, San Diego, Southern California, and Tijuana are all places where Mexican cuisine is heavily influenced, but they are not the origin of the cuisine itself.
retract | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kitten is using its claws, but needs to be taught when to do something with them in order to avoid hurting others. This implies that the solution involves the kitten being able to control its claws in some way. The verb used in the sentence, "extend", suggests that the claws are being pushed outwards. Therefore, the correct answer would be the opposite action of retracting the claws, which involves pulling them back inwards. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
sidewalk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bad man littered by tossing his bubblegum out of his window, which would most likely land on a surface near his car, such as the sidewalk or the street. The other options, such as the theater or the supermarket, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and it would be unlikely for the bubblegum to end up there.
Maine | Knowledge: Maine is known for its lobster industry, and it is a popular destination for lobster lovers. The other options are not typically associated with lobster or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. South Carolina is known for its seafood, but lobster is not a local specialty. Chesapeake Bay is known for its blue crabs, but not lobster. New England is known for seafood and could be a viable option, but Maine is specific to lobster and is a safer choice. A cruise ship could be anywhere, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
military base | Knowledge: The sentence mentions people in uniform training for war, which implies some sort of military training. Guns are commonly used in military training, so it makes sense that a gun would be present in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a crime scene would likely involve detectives rather than people training for war, a backyard is unlikely to have people in uniforms training for war, a police station would have officers training for law enforcement rather than war, and a police car would not be a suitable location for military training.
misery  | Knowledge: Suicide is often a result of severe emotional pain, commonly referred to as "misery." Other factors, such as the loss of someone or physical scars, may contribute to a person's emotional state, but they alone are not typically the sole cause of suicide. Additionally, the phrasing "kill yourself" is a problematic term that can contribute to stigma and should be avoided. The correct answer is the more appropriate and sensitive term for the underlying cause of suicide.
death | Knowledge: Drinking alcohol in excess to the point of poisoning can cause severe harm to the body, including death. Alcohol poisoning can cause respiratory depression, seizures, and a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels. Disorientation and frequent urination are also common symptoms of alcohol poisoning, but they are not as severe as the risk of death. Having sex and bad breath do not have any clear connection to alcohol poisoning.
muscles | Knowledge: The question is asking about what helps a human to move, and muscles are the primary body part responsible for movement. Humans have over 600 muscles in their body which work together to enable us to walk, run, jump, and perform other physical activities. The other options - two arms, drinks, stupidity, and one body - do not directly relate to the question or provide a plausible answer.
asthma | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that could specifically prevent someone from doing housework that involves dust. Asthma is a respiratory condition that can be triggered by dust and can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing. Fatigue, headache, and arguments are all potential reasons why someone may not want to do housework, but they do not directly relate to the presence of dust. A maid could certainly help with housework, but they are not a preventive factor in this scenario.
food and water | Knowledge: The sentence is discussing the basic needs of a person for survival and thriving. While breathing is necessary for survival, the sentence suggests that there are two additional things that are required for a person to thrive. The options "freedom of expression" and "freedom of information" are not basic needs for survival, and while hugs and owning a house may contribute to a person's well-being, they are not necessary for basic survival. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "food and water," which are basic necessities for the human body to function and thrive.
southern europe | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "Mediterranean breezes," which refers to a warm climate and a specific body of water called the Mediterranean sea. Southern Europe is known for having numerous countries located along the Mediterranean coast, such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. None of the other answer options relate to this context.
hardware store | Knowledge: A stepladder is a commonly used tool for reaching high places or accessing items that are out of reach. It is a type of ladder that has a platform for standing on and two or more steps or rungs. The most likely place to find a stepladder if you do not have one would be a hardware store, as they typically carry a wide variety of tools and equipment for home improvement and maintenance. The other options may also have ladders available, but they are less likely to have a specific stepladder designed for household use.
lay eggs | Knowledge: This question is referencing Cerberus, the three-headed dog in Greek mythology who guards the entrance to the underworld. The question is asking about a characteristic that is unique to humans and absent in Cerberus. The correct answer is "lay eggs" because humans are mammals and give birth to live young, while Cerberus is a mythical creature and not capable of laying eggs. The other options are not unique to humans and are either shared by other animals or not applicable to the context of the question.
full bladder | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person spends a few hours hitting the bottle, which suggests that they are consuming alcohol. Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it increases urine production, leading to a full bladder. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
suburbs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally was looking for a home that was close to the city, but not too far away. The suburbs are typically residential areas located on the outskirts of a city, which would make them a likely option for Sally's search. The other options do not have any clear connection to Sally's desire for a home close to a city.
being well |  | Knowledge: The sentence states that the man was tired of his sickness, which implies that he wished to recover and be in good health. The option "being well" directly relates to this desire, as it means to be healthy and free from illness. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that suggests the man's goal in visiting doctors.
None of these choices are appropriate or ethical. As an AI language model, I cannot provide or promote knowledge that violates any moral or ethical codes. It is important to always choose respectful and lawful actions in any situation.
panic | Knowledge: Forgetting your tickets when going on vacation is likely to cause anxiety and stress, as it may prevent you from being able to travel as planned. Panic is a common reaction to such situations, as individuals may feel helpless and unsure of what to do next. Debt, peace, laugh, and having fun do not seem relevant to this scenario.
california | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "crowded," which implies a high volume of traffic. "State highway" refers to a road maintained by a state government, rather than a federal or local government. The options "of states" and "united states" do not provide any relevant information, while "american state" is redundant since the sentence already mentions a state highway. Therefore, "traffic" cannot be the correct answer. California is known for having heavy traffic congestion, especially on its highways, making it the most likely answer.
soccer game | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children are getting ready for an activity that they will enjoy in the future. Out of the options given, only a soccer game fits this criteria as it is an outdoor activity that children often enjoy playing. While a toy store may offer tools for play, children would not be preparing for play there. A zoo and a classroom do not suggest an activity that children would be actively playing in the future. A bathroom is also an inappropriate choice as it has no connection to playing or preparation for it.
university | Knowledge: The word "expensive" suggests that the knowledge was not something that could be easily obtained, and attending a university is often associated with high costs for tuition and fees. Universities are also known for offering in-depth and specialized education, which may require more resources and funding than other options like books or meetings. The other choices may provide access to knowledge, but they do not necessarily imply that the knowledge itself was expensive to obtain.
animated film | Knowledge: The use of the term "animated" suggests that the entertainment in question involves some form of animation, which is typically associated with films. Additionally, anthropomorphized talking animals are a common feature in animated films for children, which eliminates options such as forrest, mulberry bush, and outdoors. The phrase "on an adventure" also implies a narrative structure, which is another characteristic of animated films. Therefore, the correct answer is animated film.
visit relatives | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is missing their aunt, which implies that they have a desire to see her. The most appropriate answer would be to visit relatives, which could include the aunt in question. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not logical actions a person would take if they miss their aunt.
orbit | Knowledge: All planets in our solar system are located in orbit around the sun. While they are technically located in outer space and the universe at large, the term "orbit" specifically denotes their path of travel around the sun. The term "sky" refers to the visible expanse above the Earth's surface and does not accurately describe the location of planets. The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our solar system but is not the location of the planets themselves.
around dinner table | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer is likely to be a place where families gather and interact. The phrase "begin" also implies that this is a starting point for a family. The option "around dinner table" is the most likely answer as it is a common place for families to come together and engage in conversation, discuss their day, and share a meal. The other options, such as a wedding or a supermarket, do not necessarily have the same association with family bonding and interaction.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: Local area codes are typically associated with specific geographic regions or cities, so if a call is coming from a local area code, it is likely that the caller is located in that area or nearby. The other options (office, motel, desktop, rest area) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the use of a local area code.
finite | Knowledge: The question is referring to the concept of life having a limit or an end date. The word "finite" means having limits or bounds, which accurately describes the idea being referenced in the question. The other options ("over," "good," "important," and "ending soon") do not accurately describe the concept being referred to.
holster | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the gun was not in a proper storage or carrying device, which resulted in discomfort for the person carrying it. The most logical option to alleviate the discomfort would be to put the gun in a holster, which is a device designed specifically to hold a firearm securely and comfortably on a person's body. The other options, such as a drawer, crime scene, police helicopter, and police station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
verbose | Knowledge: The word "laconic" means using very few words, or being brief in speech. Therefore, the professor was not using a lot of words or being overly talkative, indicating that he was probably avoiding verbose language. The other options are all words that would describe using too many words, being overly complex, or overly dramatic in language, which is opposite to the meaning of "laconic".
say hello | Knowledge: Greeting someone verbally is a common practice in human interaction. While other options may be part of human behavior, such as eating or sleeping, they do not necessarily relate to the act of greeting someone. Saying hello is a common and polite way to greet someone in many cultures, which makes it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the travelers were moving away from a mountainous area, as they were no longer seeing signs warning of falling rocks. This implies that they were entering a flatter area, which is commonly associated with countryside. Volcanoes and mountain ranges would not be described as "less steep" as they are inherently steep. "Ground" and "bridge" do not logically fit in the context of the sentence.
dryer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that towels are not available in the bathroom, which suggests that an alternative method for drying hands is needed. The most logical choice among the options is a dryer, which is commonly found in public restrooms as a hand drying option. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
ruin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is concerned about what the washing machine might do to his good jeans. The options 'shrinkage,' 'wear out,' 'wet clothes,' and 'torn' all refer to potential damage that could be caused to the jeans, but 'ruin' is the most severe option and would seem to best match with the person's concern.
All of the above | Knowledge: Eating hamburgers in a sufficient amount will lead a person to get full, consume a high number of calories, and potentially gain weight over time. Additionally, consuming large amounts of red meat can cause digestive issues such as stomach aches. Therefore, all of the answer choices provided could be correct responses to this question.
roof | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that leaves are sliding from a higher place (likely a roof) and ending up in a gutter. This would make sense as leaves on trees or the ground would not have the necessary elevation to slide into a gutter. A spout is also unlikely as it is usually connected to the gutter and wouldn't allow leaves to slide in. The street also does not make sense as gutters are usually located on the sides of buildings or homes, not in the middle of a street.
adapt |  | Knowledge: The word 'volatile' suggests that the social climate is unstable and unpredictable. In such a situation, people are more likely to adapt to the changing circumstances in order to survive or thrive. This could mean changing their behavior, beliefs, or attitudes to match the new reality. The other options do not necessarily apply to a volatile social climate, and may be too specific or general to be applicable.
british columbia | Knowledge: The sentence implies that bald eagles are not exclusive to the USA, and that they can be found in another place that is described as a "two word province." The option "british columbia" fits this description as it is a Canadian province located in the western region of the country, known for its abundance of wildlife and diverse ecosystems including coastal rainforests, mountains, and islands - all of which are ideal habitats for bald eagles. The other options do not fit the description of a two-word province, and do not have any clear connection to bald eagles.
stop people | Knowledge: Fear can often cause people to freeze or become paralyzed, preventing them from taking action or making decisions. This is a common response to a perceived threat or danger, and can manifest in many different ways. While fear can also motivate some people to take action or make changes, the sentence suggests that fear has a negative impact on people, specifically in terms of stopping them from doing something. The other options may also be possible effects of fear, but they are less directly suggested by the sentence.
feeling better | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sickness is getting better after a period of rest, which would lead to the person feeling better. The other options may be related to rest in general, but do not specifically imply an improvement in health.
see exhibits | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group was on a tour and the tour guide was providing information about different things. The phrase "then took the group to" implies that the tour guide was leading them to a specific destination. The option "see exhibits" is the most logical answer as exhibits are usually the main attraction of a tour and are something people would be taken to. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to a physical destination that the tour guide would lead the group to.
resuscitate | Knowledge: An emergency situation typically involves a critical medical condition where a patient's life is in danger. In such a situation, a doctor or any medical professional must perform resuscitation, which includes techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using a defibrillator to restart the patient's heart. Studying medicine, caring for patients, providing care, and performing a physical are all essential responsibilities of a doctor, but they may not be directly related to an emergency situation.
play music | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the iPhone has features that can replace those of an iPod, which is a music player. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to music. Of the options provided, "play music" is the most closely related to the function of an iPod, while the others are more general features that the iPhone offers.
state park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the problem with getting away from it all is that many people are also visiting the same place. This makes sense for state parks, which are often popular destinations for nature lovers looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. However, the other options are less likely to be crowded, especially considering that the sentence implies that many people are also visiting the same place. Disneyland, circus, supermarket, and carnival are generally crowded places, so they would not be suitable for getting away from it all.
practice | Knowledge: The most commonly accepted way to improve your skills in playing guitar is through practice. This involves consistently playing and practicing your skills over time, which helps you develop muscle memory and improve your technique. While polishing your guitar and having fun may also be important factors in enjoying the experience of playing guitar, they are not necessarily the key to becoming good at it. Similarly, having a desire or passion for playing guitar may motivate you to practice more, but it alone will not make you a skilled player. The term "pick" may refer to a guitar pick, but it is not a complete answer to the question and does not provide enough information to demonstrate knowledge of guitar-playing.
basic organization | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog was able to get the sheep in line, which requires a certain level of organization to achieve. Basic organization skills, such as grouping similar items together or arranging things in a particular order, can be useful in controlling and directing the movements of others. Patience, intention, and decision-making skills may also be useful for a dog in this situation, but the sentence specifically mentions the dog's ability to organize the sheep. Buying movie tickets is unrelated to the context of the sentence.
change in mood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary was singing as a way to improve her mood, as she was not happy. Singing is often used as a form of self-expression and can be a cathartic activity that helps to release emotions. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as Mary's singing is not related to physical ailments such as sore throats or hoarse voices, and being heard or sad are not specific motivations for her singing.
recycled | Knowledge: The question is asking for a positive action to take with used glass. Shattering, shatter, tempered, and broken all suggest destructive actions, so those options can be eliminated. Recycling, on the other hand, is a positive and environmentally-friendly action to take with used glass. Glass can be melted down and reused to create new products, reducing waste and conserving resources.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the marathon involved physically demanding activity (dancing) for a prolonged period of time, which would logically result in exhaustion. The other options (humiliation, sweaty, blisters) do not necessarily follow from the information given and seem less likely to be a direct consequence of the activity described. Fatigue is also a possibility, but exhaustion is a stronger and more specific answer choice.
radical | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's belief in a philosophy is not slight, but extreme. The word "radical" means extreme, especially in terms of political or social beliefs. The other options do not convey the same level of extremeness or intensity. "Significant" and "important" are neutral words that do not imply any extreme beliefs or actions, while "essencial" is a misspelling of the word "essential."
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob has access to electricity next to his nightstand, which is typically found in a bedroom. This eliminates the options of church, concert, opera, and restaurant, which are unlikely places to have a nightstand with an electrical outlet.
closeness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John initially thought that the distance between him and Sally was a problem, but that they later found out that they shared something. Based on this, it seems that the answer is likely to be a term that refers to emotional or psychological closeness between two people. "Closeness" therefore seems to be the most appropriate option, as it directly implies a sense of intimacy or emotional proximity. "Near," "proximity," and "close" are similar in meaning but do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection. "Duration" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
security personnel | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about where employees, in general, would be likely to carry a weapon. The options "war," "police station," and "army bunker" are all specific locations where members of the military or law enforcement might carry weapons, but they do not apply to all employees. "Holster" is a device used to carry a weapon, rather than a place where an employee would carry one. "Security personnel" is the only option that makes sense as a general category for employees who might be expected to carry a weapon in the course of their work.
brown meat | Knowledge: Tacos typically involve a meat filling, such as ground beef, that needs to be cooked before it can be added to the taco shell. The phrase "cook on the stove" is a clue that the answer involves a cooking method, and out of the given choices, only "brown meat" is a cooking method that involves cooking something on a stove. The other choices, like "Mexico" and "bake bread," do not make sense in the context of cooking tacos.
central idaho | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are potato fields in this region, which narrows down the choices to regions known for potato farming. Alaska, Hells Canyon, and South Lake Tahoe are not typically associated with potato farming, while both Idaho and Canada are well-known for their potato production. However, the mention of "central" in the sentence indicates that the correct answer is Central Idaho, rather than Canada which is a larger country with potato fields in multiple regions.
inside tent | Knowledge: A cord is often used to help secure or tighten different parts of a tent, such as the rainfly or the poles. It is unlikely to be found in a delivery room, hardware store, or sporting goods store unless it is specifically sold as a camping accessory. While a backpack may have cords or straps to fasten the bag, it is less likely to be the correct answer as it doesn't have a direct connection to tents. The most likely option is inside the tent, since this is where the cords are typically used.
construction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that workers are surrounding materials, which implies that there is some sort of construction or building work happening in the area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hazardous waste zone might have materials and workers, but the sentence does not mention anything about hazardous materials specifically. A fabric store, science lab, or house would not typically have workers surrounding materials in the same way a construction site would.
suburbia | Knowledge: Lawns are typically associated with residential areas where homeowners have front or back yards. Suburbia is a term used to describe the residential areas that surround a city or town, which are typically characterized by single-family houses with front and backyards. Golf courses may have many lawns, but they are not common in everyday life and are usually reserved for recreational activities. The other options, such as a neighborhood or Michigan, do not have a clear association with lawns.
austrailia | Knowledge: Koalas are native to Australia and are not commonly found in other parts of the world. Therefore, James must be living in Australia to have spotted the animal while driving to work. The other options, such as wilderness, great outdoors, and jungle, are more general terms and do not provide any specific information that would help in answering the question. Queensland is a region in Australia and could potentially be a correct answer, but the other options are not relevant.
obsolete | Knowledge: The word "obsolete" means that something is no longer in use or has become outdated. Tube televisions are old technology that have largely been replaced by newer, more advanced displays like LCD and LED screens. Therefore, it would be accurate to describe a tube television as obsolete. The other options don't fit the context of the question- addictive, entertaining, bycone and legal all don't make sense in relation to a tube television.
Disneyland | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically for a gift shop where one would be able to buy a Mickey Mouse product. Disneyland is a well-known theme park that is heavily associated with Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, so it is a logical choice for the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to Mickey Mouse or gift shops in general.
rug | Knowledge: The question is asking where you would be unable to read a newspaper, suggesting that there is a reason why reading a newspaper in this particular location is not possible. The other options (porch, school, jail, library) are all locations where reading a newspaper would be possible, but a rug is not a suitable surface for reading as it is too soft and uneven.
united states | Knowledge: Texas is a state in the United States of America, located in the southern part of the country. It is bordered by Mexico to the south, but is not located within Mexico. Texaphyrin is a chemical compound and has no relation to the location of Texas. Southwest and Gulf States refer to regions within the United States, but do not answer the specific question of where Texas is located.
town center | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the square is a location that John could go to despite his dislike for it, suggesting it is a place that is frequently visited. "Town center" is a common term used to describe the central commercial and social hub of a town, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not relate to a place that someone could go to on a regular basis.
group students | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the teacher wants to begin projects that involve collaboration among students. Therefore, the logical choice would be to group students together to work on the project. The other options do not directly relate to the idea of group work and may be less effective or not applicable in this scenario.
value life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason why the person doesn't kill others is related to a personal moral or ethical stance. Values typically guide personal behavior, and valuing human life is a common moral stance that people hold. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Grandma always had baked cookies that were easily accessible by looking in a particular location. The most likely location for storing cookies in this context would be a jar, which is often used for storing baked goods. The other options do not make sense in the context provided.
cars | Knowledge: The question asks for something that is likely to crash in an intersection, which is a place where multiple roads meet and cars are likely to cross paths. The other options, such as a fork in the road, town center, city street, and street corner, do not necessarily indicate a higher likelihood of crashes.
All of the above could potentially be options for storing furniture, depending on the specific situation and available resources.
everything | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that everything is made of, which is a broad concept that encompasses all the choices given. However, the use of the phrase "when one thinks enough about it" implies that the answer may not be immediately obvious or intuitive. The options "cupboard," "own home," "stuff in home," and "garbage dump" are all specific and limited in scope, making them unlikely correct answers. "Everything" is the most all-encompassing and abstract option, aligning with the idea that all things are made of something.
headaches | Knowledge: The question suggests that watching television too much can cause a certain type of pain. The word "pain" and the options provided suggest that the answer is related to physical discomfort rather than emotional or psychological effects. Of the options provided, only headaches are commonly associated with prolonged screen time, particularly with television viewing. Fatigue and addiction may be associated with prolonged television viewing, but they are not a direct result of the screen itself. Power gains and entertainment are not related to the negative effects of television viewing.
hour | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker was waiting for a specific event to happen, but they knew it wouldn't happen right away. They then waited a quarter past a certain time before turning on the football game. The most likely option for this time is an hour, as it is a common unit of time measurement and fits with the quarter-past reference. The other options do not make sense in the context of waiting for a specific event to happen at a particular time.
volunteer | Knowledge: The only option that makes sense is "volunteer," as it suggests that the person is working for free. The other options do not provide any logical explanation for why someone would continue to work without receiving payment. "Thank god," "wait in line," "offer help," and "enjoy working" are all unrelated to the context of the question.
muscles | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a physical need to move and suggests that if this need is not met, something will atrophy, which typically refers to a decline or wasting away of muscles. This implies that the correct answer would be something related to the body or physical activity, such as muscles. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
company | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a job and used their connections to secure an interview. The word "company" is a commonly used term for a business or organization where someone could potentially work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Wall" and "store" are too vague and could refer to many different types of businesses, while "computer network" and "airport" are too specific and do not fit the broader context of the sentence.
book or library | Knowledge: The phrase "in the old days" suggests that the question is referring to a time before the internet, which was not widely available until the late 20th century. The options "dewey decimal system" and "newspaper" are not places to find information, but a system of organization and a medium for news dissemination, respectively. The correct answer is likely a book or a library, which were the primary sources of information before the advent of digital media.
fucking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe and Jane have started engaging in unprofessional behavior that compromises their objectivity. The term "fucking" is often used figuratively to mean collaborating or collaborating intimately. Therefore, it could be the unprofessional behavior that Joe and Jane are engaging in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
washing machine | Knowledge: Dirty clothing is typically put in a washing machine to be cleaned. The other options are places where clean or folded clothing may be stored, but they are not typically used for dirty clothing. A closet is for hanging clothes, a trunk is for storage while traveling, a drawer is for organizing clothes, and a suitcase is for traveling.
revolution | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that artificial intelligence is bringing about changes in society. The word "revolution" often refers to a significant and far-reaching change, which makes it a suitable choice in this context. The other options do not appear to relate to the topic of artificial intelligence and societal change.
say love | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that George has difficulty expressing his emotions, as he keeps things bottled up. The option "say love" refers to expressing a deep emotional feeling towards someone, which would be difficult for someone like George. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
slim waist | Knowledge: Sit-ups are a type of exercise that can help strengthen and tone the abdominal muscles. This can lead to a reduction in belly fat and a more toned appearance in the waist area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the effects of doing sit-ups.
itches | Knowledge: Contact with poison ivy causes an allergic reaction in most people, resulting in an itchy and uncomfortable rash. The other options do not accurately describe the typical symptoms of poison ivy contact.
forest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a combination of trees and heavy rain. The option "sahara" is a desert and doesn't have trees or heavy rain; "disneyland" is a theme park and not a natural area; "street" is not an area with trees, and the option "seattle" is known for its heavy rainfall but doesn't specify any trees. This leaves "forest" as the only option that fits both criteria. Forests are known for their abundance of trees, and certain types of forests, such as rainforests, experience heavy rainfall.
continent | Knowledge: Death Valley is a large national park located in the western United States. It is well known and often visited by tourists from all over the world, making it highly unlikely that it would be located in a region as specific as West Virginia or Mountainous Area. Additionally, Death Valley is a significant enough location to be referred to by the continent it is located on, rather than just the country. Therefore, the correct answer is continent.
bliss | Knowledge: The phrase "ignorance is bliss" is a common idiom that suggests that sometimes it's better not to know the truth or to remain ignorant because it can lead to a sense of peace or happiness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of ignorance in the context of the question.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking to get a cheap room and that they are currently at a reception desk. Since reception desks are typically found at hotels, the answer is likely to be "at hotel." The other options (lobby, office park, cellphone, motel) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
clothing store | Knowledge: The word "fashionable" suggests that the satchel is likely to be found in a store that sells clothing and accessories instead of a place like an airport or luggage compartment. The other options are also unlikely to be the correct answer because they do not provide any context related to the purchase of a satchel.
backyards | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel was searching for something specific in the garbage, which is likely to be food. Backyards are a common place where people dispose of food scraps and other organic waste, which would make them a likely target for a scavenging weasel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
of hatred | Knowledge: The phrase "why would I be killed" implies that the reason for potential harm is not related to personal actions, such as attacking someone or being gay. The use of the preposition "of" also suggests that the harm is coming from a feeling or attitude, rather than an action. "Hatred" is a common motivator for violence and harm towards individuals who are perceived as different or who belong to a marginalized group. The other options may be reasons for violence or self-defense, but do not directly address the question of why someone would be targeted for harm.
computer game | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the graphic designer worked with digital tiles, which suggests that they worked in a digital medium. The fact that these tiles were used to make maps further supports the idea that they were creating content for a computer game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
society | Knowledge: The word "transgressed" implies that Bill broke a rule or boundary that was socially or morally significant. The fact that the context does not mention anything about politics or sports suggests that the correct answer is likely to be "society". The inclusion of "basketball" twice in the choices is likely a mistake or typo.
pharmacy | Knowledge: Teeth whitening bleachers are a cosmetic dental product, which would not be found at a gymnasium or sporting event. The correct answer would likely be a place that sells dental or oral care products, such as a pharmacy. The presence of "bleachers" in the question may be a typo or a misused term, as bleachers are typically associated with seating arrangements at sports events rather than dental products.
united states | Knowledge: Louisiana is one state out of 50 in the United States, so the correct answer is "united states." The other options are either specific to Louisiana (deep south, gulf states), unrelated to geography (98 of the world's crayfish), or vague (swamp).
clean room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child has finished playing with their toys and needs to do something next. The option "clean room" is the most logical choice as it is a common instruction given to children after they finish playing with their toys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "go to bed" is more suitable as a bedtime instruction, "become adult" and "grow up" are milestones that occur over time and not something that can be done immediately, and "read book" is not related to cleaning up after playing with toys.
paws | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for the name of the feet on a dog. The word "paws" is commonly used to refer to the feet of dogs (and other animals with similar feet). The other options (two ears, one mouth, big heart, tail) do not refer to the feet of a dog, and therefore are not the correct answer.
rest area | Knowledge: Rest areas are public areas along highways or major roads where travelers can stop to take a break and use the facilities. They usually have restrooms that are accessible to anyone who needs to use them, regardless of whether they are a paying customer or not. The other options may have public restrooms, but they may not be available for use by just anyone or may have restrictions on who can use them.
building | Knowledge: The use of an arch as a doorway is a common architectural feature in buildings, where it adds both aesthetic value and structural strength. While arches may also be used in bridges and cathedrals, the sentence specifically refers to a doorway, suggesting that it is more likely to be found in a building. The option "ancient Rome" may be a distractor, as the use of arches was prominent in Roman architecture, but it does not directly relate to the context of the sentence. The option "hole" is clearly not appropriate for the sentence.
hardware store | Knowledge: Threaded rods are commonly used in construction and can typically be found in hardware stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to threaded rods or their use in construction.
vessel | Knowledge: A vase is a type of vessel used for holding flowers or other decorative items. The base of a vase is the part that sits on a flat surface and provides stability for the vessel. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
tamales bay | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shark is in a location that is specific to Northern California. Sea World and aquariums are general terms that do not refer to a specific location. Tropical waters and great oceans are too broad to pinpoint the shark's location to Northern California. Tamales Bay is a specific location in Northern California that is known for having a diverse range of marine life, which could explain why the shark is there.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the picture was framed for personal enjoyment, as the speaker wants to look at it while eating dinner. This implies that the picture is likely in their home or a personal space, making the most likely location for it to be on a table. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that rocks can be found on planets and moons, but there is a wide variety of them on a specific location. The only choice that relates to a location where rocks can be found on earth is the surface of the earth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bowl of fruit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe bought grapes as a topping for something, and the most likely option is a bowl of fruit. Grapes are a common fruit that can be used in fruit bowls, often as a colorful and juicy addition. The other options do not make as much sense in this context - Joe is unlikely to use grapes to make wine or shop with them, and they do not make a great topping for desserts or a source of sunshine.
cupboard | Knowledge: The word "store" in the sentence suggests that the answer has to do with a location where items are kept. "Chess set and other such entertainment items" are typically stored in a cupboard or cabinet, which makes it an appropriate option. Coffeehouse or coffee house is a public place where coffee is served, and therefore is not a good choice for home entertainment storage. Laundry room is mostly used for washing clothes, so it doesn't fit either. Game room is also a possibility for storing board games, but the most commonly used term for storage is cupboard.
coin collection | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the token was not a genuine coin and was found among other coins in a collection. A coin collection is a grouping of rare or valuable coins, and it makes sense that a fraudulent token would be identified in such a context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or have any clear connection to coins or tokens.
alley | Knowledge: The term "alley cat" specifically refers to a feral or stray cat that lives in urban areas, often in alleys or other places with limited human traffic. Therefore, the most likely answer is "alley." The other options may be comfortable for a cat, but they do not have the same association with the term "alley cat."
raising interest rates | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that inflation is a concern in economics, but the focus is on the impact of inflation on someone who is about to become a homeowner. The phrase "had to worry about" implies that the impact of inflation is negative, which suggests that the correct answer is related to inflation having a potential impact that would be problematic for someone in the process of purchasing a home. The correct answer, "raising interest rates," is the most plausible choice, as inflation can lead to higher interest rates, which in turn would make it difficult for the homeowner to afford their mortgage payments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
coffee shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James desires to have tea but does not have any options available to him at home. He then rushes out, which indicates that he is seeking a location where tea is available. The options "internet cafe" and "refrigerator" do not make sense in this context, as they do not typically offer tea. "Teapot" and "cupboard" suggest that James may be able to make tea at home, but the sentence clearly states that he does not have any tea or teabags. "Coffee shop" is the most likely option, as coffee shops commonly offer a variety of tea options.
Florida | Knowledge: Bald eagles are commonly associated with the United States, and are particularly prevalent in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. However, Florida is also a known habitat for bald eagles. The question suggests that there is a location where foreigners might expect to see a bald eagle, but where they probably won't. This indicates that the answer is not one of the typical habitats for bald eagles, such as Canada, Washington, or Colorado. Utah is also not known as a particularly common habitat for bald eagles. Therefore, the correct answer must be Florida, which may surprise foreigners who are not aware of the state's bald eagle population.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the poet needed to write about his distant past, which is likely to be related to his personal life experiences. Therefore, the most appropriate place for the poet to go to write about his past is likely to be his own home, where he may have access to personal documents, photographs or other memorabilia that can help him remember his past experiences. The other options do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dance together | Knowledge: Nightclubs are often associated with music, dancing, and socializing. The phrase "on the floor" refers to the dance floor, where people typically come together to dance and enjoy the music. The other options do not make sense in the context of a nightclub, where the focus is on socializing and having fun.
palm pilot | Knowledge: A stylus is a small tool used to interact with touchscreens, and is typically associated with devices like smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) like the Palm Pilot. While it's possible that a stylus could be used in a school or garage setting, the other options (hand and record player) are unlikely choices for where one would keep a stylus.
locker room | Knowledge: A towel is often used in a gym for wiping sweat off during or after a workout, and it makes sense to keep them close by in the locker room where gym-goers change and store their belongings. In the showers or swimming pool, towels may also be provided, but they would likely be kept there rather than brought from home. A linen closet or cupboard may be used to store towels in other contexts, but it is less likely in a gym setting.
insomnia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob is not going to bed despite it being a weekday, which implies that he is not able to sleep. The word "insomnia" refers to the condition of being unable to sleep, which is the most likely reason why Bob is staying up late. The other options either have no connection to the context of the sentence or do not fit the situation presented.
movie theater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a ticket booth is located at the front of a specific type of establishment. Movie theaters commonly have ticket booths located at the front of the building, where patrons can purchase tickets before entering. The other options may also have ticket booths, but without additional context, it is unclear where they might be located.
shopping cart | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people typically bring a reusable bag with them to the grocery store and use it to carry their purchased items. The phrase "keep a bag" suggests that the bag is already in their possession, and the most likely place for them to keep it is in the shopping cart that they use to navigate the store. The other options, such as a drawer or shelf, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
pencil box | Knowledge: The question implies that the eraser will be used in class, so it should be brought to school. The choices "office supply store" and "schools" are not places to put the eraser, but rather places to acquire an eraser. "Under the arm" is not a practical place to put an eraser while traveling. The most logical answer is to put the eraser in a pencil box, which can be easily carried to class.
screen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the flashing LED is visible on some sort of display or monitor, which is typically associated with a computer screen. The other options, such as electronic equipment or pc board, are too broad and do not specifically refer to a computer screen. It is also important to note that not all flashing LEDs indicate a serious problem, but the sentence implies that in this case it might be a cause for concern.
saltwater | Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in saltwater environments, such as the ocean. Bull sharks are one of the few shark species that can tolerate freshwater and are sometimes found in rivers and lakes. However, the question specifically states that it is not a bull shark, so the answer must be one of the options related to saltwater environments. Sea world is a theme park and not a location where a shark could go to live, so it can be ruled out. "Medium" and "seawater" may not be specific enough to indicate that the shark needs to go to a saltwater environment, whereas "Atlantic Ocean" specifically refers to a saltwater environment. Therefore, "saltwater" is the best answer.
law | Knowledge: The question is asking about what can come before or lead to civil action, which is a legal process. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the law. Options such as hurt feelings or bad feelings are not directly related to the legal process and are unlikely to precede civil action. Going to court and trial are part of the legal process, but they are not necessarily the initial step that comes before initiating civil action. Therefore, law is the most appropriate answer as it refers to the legal framework under which civil action takes place.
like | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the men had a positive conversation and found common ground, which suggests they had a friendly relationship. Describing their feeling toward one another as "like" would be a natural choice to convey this sense of mutual respect and agreement. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Problem" and "contract" have negative connotations and do not fit with the positive tone of the conversation. "Peace" and "love" are also unlikely choices as they suggest a deeper emotional connection that may not be present in this context.
furniture store | Knowledge: The question is asking where to get a specific item, a table. A furniture store would be the most likely place to purchase a table as they specialize in selling furniture for homes and businesses. The other options, such as demonstration, kitchen, hallway, and apartment, do not offer a clear connection to purchasing furniture.
pant pocket | Knowledge: The question implies that the person being asked is a man and therefore, the answer choice that would apply specifically to men's clothing is "pant pocket". Men's pants often have pockets that are suitable for carrying small items such as eyeglasses cases. The other options such as purse or bag are more commonly associated with women's accessories. Store and drawer are also not appropriate because they do not suggest a specific location on a person's body for carrying an eyeglasses case.
stress | Knowledge: The word "intense" suggests a high level of competition, which can be a source of stress for many people. Stress is a common response to intense competition because it can cause feelings of pressure, anxiety, and overwhelm. The other options, like argument and tension, may be outcomes of intense competition, but they are not directly related to how someone might feel in response to it. Anger and happiness are also unlikely because they are emotions that are typically associated with a personal victory or defeat, rather than a response to competition itself.
conversation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person meets their friend every Monday morning to engage in an activity that involves both coffee and conversation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Saying "hi" or shaking hands could be a part of the greeting, but they would not typically be the main activity. Having sex or taking a train do not make sense in this context.
bowling alley | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the noise is being made intentionally by a group of people. A big city, transmission, and classroom would likely have some level of supervision or regulations in place to prevent excessive noise. In the front yard, it would be unlikely for a group of people to gather and intentionally make noise without supervision. A bowling alley, however, is a social gathering place where people often come to make noise and have fun, with little to no supervision.
supermarket | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer should refer to a place where most people can get food, which rules out options like the fridge, oven, and kitchen as not everyone has access to these. The table is also not a good answer as it is not a place where one can get food, but rather a surface where food can be served. The most plausible answer is the supermarket, as it is a place where a variety of foods can be purchased and is accessible to most people.
kill | Knowledge: The word "murder" implies that the predator intentionally caused the death of their victim, so the correct answer would be "kill." The other options may also be associated with causing harm or pain to someone, but they do not specifically relate to causing death.
backyard | Knowledge: The options suggest different places where a garden could be located. A park is a public space and unlikely to be available for personal gardening. A fence is a structure that one can attach plants to, but it is not a location for a garden. Ground is too general and does not give a specific location. A balcony is a small space and is not ideal for most types of gardening. A backyard is a typical location for a personal garden, as it is a readily available outdoor space owned by the individual.
scrutinizing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consumer should be cautious when presented with proof that seems too good to be true. Scrutinizing means examining something closely and carefully, which is a good approach to determine whether the proof is legitimate or not. Exasperation, change of heart, and boredom do not suggest any action the consumer can take to evaluate the proof. Reading is a general action and does not necessarily relate to the context of being presented with proof.
choke | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man ate his lunch quickly and did not chew his food properly, which led to a negative consequence. Choking is a common risk of swallowing large pieces of food without proper mastication, so this is the most logical choice. Getting full, burping, eating food, and regurgitating do not fit with the context of the sentence or contribute to the logical progression of events.
play music | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Susan spent most of her day listening to the radio, but did not like talk shows. The most likely alternative for her preferred listening genre would be stations that play music. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
joy | Knowledge: The word "entertained" suggests that the person enjoyed watching the film, which could lead to a feeling of joy. Laughter and liking are also possible reactions to being entertained, but masturbation and erection are not appropriate or common reactions to watching a film.
park | Knowledge: The sign is specifically referring to picnickers, suggesting that they are in a public area where people go to have picnics, such as a park. Squirrels can be found in many environments, including forests, trees, roofs, and yards, but the mention of picnickers implies an area specifically designated for recreational activities. Therefore, the correct answer is park.
england | Knowledge: The question states that the astronaut needed to know the location of the English Channel, which is a body of water located between England and France. Therefore, the correct answer would be England, as that is the location of the specific geographic feature the astronaut was trying to locate. The other options are not relevant to the question or do not provide an accurate answer.
stupid | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a negative association with baseball, and "stupid" is the only option that suggests a dislike or disdain for the activity. The other options all suggest positive feelings towards baseball, which would not make sense in the context of someone who does not enjoy it. "Fun," "entertainment," and "love" are all positive words that indicate enjoyment, whereas "stupid" is a negative word that suggests a lack of interest or distaste.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence states that John and James loved making friends. This suggests that the act of making friends brought them positive emotions. The choice "good feeling" is synonymous with happiness and therefore the correct answer choice. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they suggest negative outcomes rather than positive ones.
intimacy | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John had a problem that made celebrating with his friends awkward. The word "awkward" suggests discomfort or unease in social situations, which may be caused by a difficulty with intimacy. This could include a fear of opening up emotionally, feeling uncomfortable with physical touch or closeness, or having a history of trauma or abuse. The other answer choices do not align with the context of the sentence.
sit still | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had been sitting in meetings for a long time and needed to move, implying that they were sitting still for an extended period. The other choices (be still, stay put, stay still, standing still) do not fit the context of the sentence as they imply a state of not moving or changing position, whereas the person clearly needed to move.
natural habitat | Knowledge: Foxes are wild animals that typically live in their natural habitat, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. They may occasionally wander into residential areas like backyards or hen houses in search of food, but these are not their everyday habitats. Storybooks and bathrooms are not places where foxes would typically go, making natural habitat the most likely answer.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs ice to have a refreshing drink, but the appliance that they usually use to keep their drinks cold is not working properly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
botanical gardens | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking about a place where people go to view multiple rosebushes. While small plantings of roses may be found in some of the other options (such as a backyard or hedgerow), the only option that specifically refers to a location with multiple varieties of plants is a botanical garden. Additionally, botanical gardens often have dedicated rose gardens or sections, making them a likely answer.
desk drawer | Knowledge: Glue is a common item used in office and school settings, and it is typically stored in a desk drawer or supply cabinet when not in use. The other options, such as art room or bathroom, may also be places where glue is used, but they are not as common for storage purposes. The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a common location for storage rather than a specific use case.
use water | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman was concerned about the environmental impact of washing clothes, which suggests that she may have been trying to conserve resources like water. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to involve her actions related to water usage. The other answer choices do not address this concern directly and are less likely to be correct.
rumors spread | Knowledge: The word "false stories" suggests that the act of talking to others about them may lead to the spread of rumors. Rumors are often based on untrue or exaggerated information that is passed from person to person through conversation. Adverse reactions, such as disagreement or anger, can be a result of spreading false stories, but it is less likely to be the direct outcome. Teaching, friendship, and increased understanding are not directly related to the act of talking about false stories.
achromatic | Knowledge: The word "achromatic" refers to colors that have no hue, such as white, black, and shades of gray. The yellow color of the sun, while appearing bright and bold, is actually achromatic because it has no hue of its own but rather comes from a combination of different wavelengths of light. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
human being | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the spirit was leaving the physical body of a human being and transitioning to the afterlife. The options "bar," "cemetery," and "graveyard" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are locations rather than the thing that the spirit was leaving. "Earth" is too general and could refer to many things, but "human being" directly relates to the context of the sentence.
laboratory  | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a helium tank being used for research, suggesting that the correct answer is related to scientific work. The options "sadistic dentist's office" and "moon" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. "Atmosphere" is a possibility, but it does not specifically relate to research. "Chemistry lab" and "laboratory" both indicate a scientific purpose, but "chemistry lab" may be too specific and limiting, whereas "laboratory" could encompass various fields of research that may use helium tanks. Therefore, the best choice is "laboratory."
map | Knowledge: The best way to locate the United States is by using a map. The other options do not provide a clear method for finding the country. North America is a continent that includes the United States but does not pinpoint its location. The northern hemisphere and western hemisphere are not specific enough to locate a country within them. Magnets have no relevance to geographic location.
city | Knowledge: Excavating for new roads in a city is likely to cause traffic jams as it involves closing off streets and rerouting traffic. The other options do not involve the same kind of urban infrastructure and would not have a significant impact on road traffic.
banned | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that James is concerned that potatosol might not be legal for long, suggesting that there is a possibility of it being banned in the future. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
watching a game | Knowledge: Baseball is a sport that is typically played in stadiums, and is referred to as a "game" rather than a "sporting event," "watch show," "show," or "demonstration." While other events may take place in stadiums such as concerts or demonstrations, the context of the sentence specifically mentions being a spectator at a baseball stadium, indicating that the correct answer is "watching a game."
grocery store | Knowledge: The mention of "shopping bag full of food" suggests that the person went to a place where they purchase groceries in bulk or large quantities. A garden typically would not produce enough food to fill multiple shopping bags, a closet is not a place to buy food, and a restaurant or mart would not usually result in large amounts of food being taken home in shopping bags.
work hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that achieving a goal requires hard work, despite the fact that you may not always get what you want. Working hard is one of the key elements of achieving a goal, as it requires time, effort, and patience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not offer a clear solution to achieving a goal.
open eyes | Knowledge: The verb "awake" implies that the person is currently sleeping or unconscious. Therefore, the most reasonable action to follow being awake is to open their eyes, which is a natural response when one regains consciousness. The other options do not make sense in the context of being awake, as they either refer to a state of sleep or being unconscious.
broken heart | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker experienced a romantic breakup, which can often result in emotional distress and a feeling of heartbreak. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence – annoyance may be a reaction to the breakup, but does not describe the speaker's emotional state, and hospitalized and schizophrenia are not related to the situation at all. Stress could be a result of the breakup, but the phrasing of the sentence implies that the speaker is specifically referring to the emotional pain of heartbreak.
good sleep | Knowledge: The question is asking about the reason for going to bed, suggesting that there is a benefit or purpose to doing so. The most likely reason for going to bed is to get good sleep, as that is the primary function of going to bed at night. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
amusement park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is hoping to ride a rollercoaster, which is a ride typically found in amusement parks. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "amusement park." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathe | Knowledge: The word "yourself" suggests that the question is asking about personal hygiene. The word "dirt" implies that something is dirty or soiled. The most appropriate action to take to clean oneself thoroughly would be to take a bath, as this would allow the person to wash their entire body. The other options either refer to cleaning clothes or using a cloth to wipe off a specific spot on the body, which may not be sufficient for removing all dirt.
human | Knowledge: The sentence implies that despite coming from different backgrounds, everyone mentioned in the sentence shares a common trait. The term "human" encompasses all individuals regardless of their background, making it the most appropriate choice. The other options may also apply to some individuals, but they do not encompass everyone and therefore are not as suitable as the answer.
heart attacks | Knowledge: Exercise is known to have many health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and improving overall health. The sentence specifically mentions "preventing" something, which suggests that exercising can help with a specific health issue. Heart attacks are a major health concern and are often caused by a lack of exercise and poor heart health. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
expressive | Knowledge: The word "emotional" implies that the person is likely to show or express their feelings. Therefore, the choice that matches this description is "expressive". The other options do not necessarily relate to being emotional.
dry skin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wind was warm, which means it was not likely blowing hard or changing direction. Dry hair and cotton mouth are not typically associated with the effect of wind on a person's body. However, warm wind can have a drying effect on the skin, which is why dry skin is the most appropriate choice.
gulf of mexico | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the crab was being netted off the coast of Louisiana, which is a state located on the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, it is likely that the crab was caught in the Gulf of Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Tidepools are typically located near rocky shores and would not be a common place to catch crabs, while the North Sea is located in Europe, making it an unlikely location for a crab caught off the coast of Louisiana. A grocery store is a place where people buy food, not where crabs are caught. A fishing boat is a possible location for catching crabs, but the sentence does not provide any direct evidence to support this option.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that thinking about nice memories will lead to a particular outcome. The word "relax" is most commonly associated with recalling pleasant experiences and can often have a calming effect. None of the other options are clearly linked to the context of the sentence.
know truth | Knowledge: The word "facts" suggests that the sentence is referring to knowledge that is based on objective evidence and can be verified. The phrase "know truth" is a common expression used to describe the pursuit of accurate, verifiable knowledge. The other options, such as "intelligent children" or "wonderful memories", do not directly relate to the concept of factual knowledge. Similarly, "acknowledgment" and "confidence" may be desirable outcomes of knowing the truth, but they are not the same as knowing the truth itself.
electrabus | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person needs an electric motor to power some sort of transportation. While an electric mixer, electric hammer, electric typewriter, and drum sander all use electric motors, they are not typically used for transportation. An electrabus, on the other hand, is a type of bus that is powered by an electric motor. Therefore, this would be the most appropriate answer.
movie theaters | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ticket offices being referred to are all of the same type, which implies that they are part of a larger organization, such as a chain of movie theaters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of ticket offices being uniform or part of a larger group.
paying bills | Knowledge: The sentence implies that after getting paid, there is something specific that people should do. Among the options provided, paying bills is the most practical and responsible option. The other options, such as shopping and spending money, may bring temporary happiness or satisfaction, but they do not address the immediate financial responsibilities that come with getting paid.
motel | Knowledge: The word "motel" typically refers to a type of lodging that is usually limited to one or two floors, as opposed to a hotel which may have multiple floors. The other options, such as Mexico or magic, do not suggest anything about the number of floors in a place to stay, and a phone book would only provide a list of options, not information about the type of lodging.
cow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer was good at raising chickens, but he wasn't ready to move up to something else. The options "rooster" and "hen" are both types of chickens, so they do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bought at store" is also unrelated, as it doesn't refer to any specific animal. "Tuna" is a type of fish, which is also unrelated. "Cow" is a larger animal and would represent a step up in terms of the complexity of the farming operation, making it the correct answer.
salad | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is describing a dish made with chicken and grape vinaigrette dressing. This type of dish is commonly referred to as a salad, which typically includes lettuce or other greens as a base. The other options, such as a bowl of fruit or a table, do not make sense in the context of describing a dish. Food store and restaurant are possible options, but the sentence doesn't give enough information to suggest whether the dish was bought from a store or eaten at a restaurant.
bank | Knowledge: A green bill refers to a paper currency note, typically in the United States, where the most common denomination of paper currency is a green $20 bill. These bills are most commonly found and exchanged at banks, making "bank" the correct answer. The other options do not typically involve the exchange or use of paper currency.
say hello | Knowledge: Saying hello is a common way to greet someone. It is a polite and friendly way to acknowledge someone's presence and start a conversation. The other options may also be associated with greeting someone, but saying hello is the most direct and commonly used phrase.
laboratory  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a place where people intentionally avoid animals. Laboratory is a common place where animals are kept for scientific experiments, and people try to avoid disrupting their study or harming the animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as most people do not avoid animals in places like state parks, fairgrounds, zoos, or grocery stores.
lobby | Knowledge: The word "reception desk" implies a place where guests or visitors are greeted and checked in. In most cases, this would be located in a public area such as a lobby, where it is easily accessible and visible to those who are arriving. The other options may have desks, but they are less likely to have a dedicated reception desk, and would not be appropriate in the context of the question.
restroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a physical sensation related to their bladder, which typically indicates a need to urinate. Restrooms are the most common place to relieve oneself in this situation, while the other options do not provide obvious relief or may be inappropriate. Going outside or into a cornfield may not be socially acceptable or sanitary, and school or Star Trek do not offer any logical solutions to a physical bodily sensation.
continent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Mississippi River is the largest in a certain region, which is further specified as North America. This means that the other options, such as wilderness or city, are not likely to be accurate choices since they do not describe a larger region. The word "continent" makes sense as a choice because it refers to a large landmass, and it also matches with the context of the sentence.
losing money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person playing poker is not good at it, and the question is about what will happen if they continue to play. Losing money is a common result of playing poker, especially if one is not skilled at it. Discord, social events, competition, and heightened awareness are not necessarily related to playing poker or the consequences of not being good at it.
cause illness and/or damage | Knowledge: Illegal drugs are not approved by regulatory agencies for safe use, and therefore, they pose a high risk for negative health effects. The long-term use of illegal drugs could result in addiction, mental disorders, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular diseases, liver failure, and other serious health problems. The other options do not accurately reflect the negative consequences of taking illegal drugs.
rest more | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is not well enough to go to school and needs to stay in bed to recover. Mom tells Sarah to stay in bed until she is able to go to school again, implying that she needs more rest. The option "get back under the covers" is similar but not exactly what mom said to Sarah, and the options "you're sick" and "were sick" are not relevant as they do not provide any information on what mom said to Sarah when she tried to get up.
california | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wild rosebush being referred to is a special or unique one, indicating that it may not be commonly found in most locations. The options "botanic garden," "flower garden," and "landscaping" all suggest more controlled and planned environments, making it less likely for a wild rosebush to be found there. "Courtyard" could potentially be a location where a rare wild rosebush is found, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Therefore, "California" is the most likely answer since it is a large state with diverse geography and flora, and could potentially be home to a special wild rosebush.
fashion show | Knowledge: The word "runway" has multiple meanings, but in the context of this question, it is likely referring to the long platform used in fashion shows for models to walk on. In this case, the question is using a play on words, suggesting that the runway (platform) is trying to escape from the fashion show. The other options (city, military base, bowling alley, maze) do not have any clear connection to the context or meaning of the word "runway" in this question.
mountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that mines are typically located under something, which could be a geographical feature like a valley or mountain. Of the options provided, only "mountain" fits this description. Pennsylvania and Cambodia are both regions that have mines, but the sentence does not suggest a specific location. The words "desert" and "valley" do not provide any information about where mines are typically found.
hardware | Knowledge: The question is asking for an object that has a knob but does not have a display. A knob is typically used to adjust or control something, while a display is used to show information or visual output. Therefore, an object that has a knob but no display is likely to be a piece of hardware or equipment that is used for some sort of physical control or adjustment, such as a doorknob or a faucet handle. The other options either have displays or do not typically have knobs.
big city | Knowledge: The term "several businesses in the same location" suggests a commercial area or a business district. A park is typically a recreational area, while an art museum or gallery would feature artistic works rather than businesses. A skyscraper or an office building could contain multiple businesses, but they could also be standalone facilities. A big city, on the other hand, is known for having numerous businesses within a relatively small geographic area, making it the most likely answer.
get ideas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the writer was struggling with his story and trying to reconnect with its purpose. The phrase "soon he began to finally" implies that a positive change occurred. "Get ideas" is the most logical choice because it suggests that the writer was able to overcome his writer's block and generate new ideas. "Daydream" and "become distracted" are possibilities, but they do not necessarily suggest that the writer was able to solve his problem. "Headache" and "gave up" are clearly not the correct answer, as they are negative outcomes.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trombone is a lively and energetic instrument, which is a common characteristic of instruments played in marching bands. Marching bands perform outdoors and often move around, so they need instruments that can be heard over the noise of a crowd and the movement of the performers. The other options may not necessarily require an animated instrument like the trombone.
quiet mind | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John used music as a tool to help him focus, which implies that the music had a calming or soothing effect. The choice "quiet mind" is the most logical answer, as it directly relates to the purpose of using music for concentration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
high grass | Knowledge: Snakes are known to hide in areas with plenty of cover, and tall grass is a common place for them to seek shelter in meadows. The other options - underwater, tropical forest, amazon river, and western Texas - do not provide any context or indication for where a snake in a meadow would likely hide.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is feeling a burden or weight on their mind while driving to work, which suggests a feeling of stress. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to making important decisions or feeling a sense of burden. Agitation and impatience suggest a more reactive emotional state rather than a feeling of pressure or responsibility. Promotion is a positive occurrence that would not typically cause stress in this context.
catch fish | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person's primary intention for going fishing was to relax and be in nature. Therefore, it would not make sense for them to be solely focused on catching fish, as that would make the activity more stressful and less enjoyable. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the context of the sentence.
museum | Knowledge: The use of the word "old" suggests that the clavichord is an antique item. Antique musical instruments are often found in museums, where they are preserved and displayed for the public to see. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
accelerate | Knowledge: In order to take off, an airplane needs to accelerate down the runway. This is a critical step in the takeoff process, as the speed of the airplane directly impacts its ability to lift off the ground. The other options are not accurate or appropriate, as they either describe negative outcomes or unrelated actions.
hunger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason they decided to buy food from the stand, despite acknowledging that it was unhealthy, is because they were suffering from something that made them desperate for food. The option that best fits this context is hunger. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mountains | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is specifically referring to something that can form above treeline, which is the elevation point beyond which trees cannot grow. Mountains are typically found at high elevations and can form above treeline due to various geological processes such as folding and faulting. The other options (surface of earth, pit, bridge, minerals) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
grow corn | Knowledge: The word "maze" suggests that the farmer is creating a corn maze, which is a popular activity in many regions. Corn is a common crop used for mazes because it grows tall and dense, making it easy to create pathways through the stalks. The other choices do not relate to the activity of creating a maze.
being brave | Knowledge: The question implies that crossing a busy road is a dangerous action, so choosing an answer that suggests the chicken survived the crossing would be inaccurate. "Stupid" is a negative adjective that implies the chicken was foolish or didn't understand the danger of crossing the road. "Eaten" and "smashed" both suggest the chicken met an unfortunate end. "Egg" and "beef" are not appropriate choices as they are not related to the context of the question. "Being brave" is the most appropriate choice as it suggests that the chicken took a risk by crossing the road and demonstrated courage or fearlessness in doing so.
hockey game | Knowledge: It is common for players in hockey games to experience physical contact and collisions, which can result in injuries such as lost teeth. This is not typically seen in football or soccer, which are known more for their physicality and endurance rather than direct body-to-body contact. The other options, such as race tracks and generic "sporting events," do not have any clear connection to teeth loss.
make friends | Knowledge: The question is asking for a positive social interaction with others, and making friends is a common and healthy way to do so. Shaving legs, believing in God, and using drugs are personal choices that do not necessarily involve interacting with others. Standing upright is a physical posture and not related to social behavior.
go to school | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people in the protagonist's neighborhood were likely facing difficulties that caused them to quit or drop out of something. The fact that the protagonist still possessed ambition in spite of the challenges suggests that he is determined to achieve something that is positive and impactful. Among the given choices, "go to school" seems to be the best fit as it is commonly associated with ambition and personal betterment. The other options do not seem to align with the sense of ambition conveyed in the sentence.
corner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dust accumulates in the corner, which is a common location where dust can gather due to lack of airflow or cleaning. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as dust does not typically collect on a windowsill or with frogs, and while it can accumulate on a carpet or ground, the sentence specifically mentions the corner as the target location for the dust.
hot room | Knowledge: A fan is typically used in a setting that is hot or lacks air circulation, such as a hot room. It can help to circulate the air and create a cooling effect. A sports stadium is usually open-air, so a fan may not be necessary. An appliance store and hockey game do not require the use of a fan, and a sauna usually has its own ventilation system.
grocery store | Knowledge: Ketchup is a condiment that is commonly found in grocery stores. While it may be stored in a refrigerator, the question is asking where to buy it, not where to find it once it has already been purchased. Ketchup is also commonly available in fast food restaurants, but the question is not pointing to where to find ketchup while eating out. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
apartment complex | Knowledge: The question suggests that the mailbox is located within a residential building, which eliminates the options of street corner and post office. The use of the word "residents" implies that the mailbox is only used by those who live in the building, ruling out door bell and front door as options. Therefore, the only logical choice is apartment complex.
mining operation | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a dynamite expert checking fuses, which implies that explosives are being used. Explosives are commonly used in mining and construction, but specifically mentioning a dynamite expert suggests that the context is related to mining. The phrase "profitable day" also implies that the operation is a business, which further supports the idea that the context is related to mining. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of explosives or a profitability aspect.
defend yourself | Knowledge: The verb "attacking" implies an act of aggression towards the individual, which means that the correct response to the situation would be to defend oneself. The other options, such as "attacked" and "of hatred" are not actions but descriptions. "Call home" and "get rid of" are not appropriate responses in this context.
white | Knowledge: Milk is usually described as being white, as it is the natural color of milk produced by mammals, including cows, goats, and sheep. The other options do not relate to the color of milk.
meadow | Knowledge: Sheep typically graze in grassy areas such as meadows, fields or pastures. Fairgrounds and goat are not generally associated with grazing sheep, and it is not possible for sheep to graze on Mars. While some sheep may be found on farms, the term "farm" is too broad and does not specifically indicate where sheep graze.
michigan | Knowledge: The name of the expressway suggests that it is located in a specific area, which is likely to be Michigan since Ann Arbor is a city in Michigan. The other options such as "american city," "large city," "eastern united states," and "metropolitan area" are too broad for this specific question and do not provide any specific information about where the Ann Arbor Expressway can be found.
ask many questions | Knowledge: Teachers are known for encouraging children to ask many questions in order to stimulate curiosity and facilitate learning. Asking questions helps children to develop critical thinking skills and fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. None of the other options are relevant to what teachers typically encourage children to do.
jar or refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the jelly needs to be preserved, which implies that it needs to be stored in a way that will allow it to last for a longer period of time. A jar is a common container used for preserving jelly, as it can be sealed tightly and kept in a cool, dark place to prevent spoilage. Refrigerating the jelly is another option, as the cold temperature can slow down the growth of bacteria and keep the jelly fresh for a longer period of time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
two arms | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking about the physical features of a human's upper body. Among the options, "two arms" is the only correct answer as it accurately describes a key feature of the upper body. The other options, such as "processing power" and "stupidity," are not physical features of the body and are not relevant to the context of the question.
tropical rainforest | Knowledge: The use of the word "humidity" suggests that the ficus requires a humid environment to grow vigorously. The tropical rainforest is known for its high levels of humidity, making it the most suitable choice. The other options, such as trees or a sunny window, do not necessarily provide the necessary humidity for the ficus to thrive. Additionally, the use of the word "weather" suggests that the ficus requires a consistent environment, which a rainforest can provide.
concentrate | Knowledge: The sentence asks what is required to be good at driving cars, which suggests a need for a skill or ability. One of the options, concentrate, is a necessary skill for driving as it requires focus and attention to detail in order to safely operate a vehicle. The other options, such as having fun, listening to the radio, or speeding, are not necessarily related to being good at driving and may actually hinder one's abilities. While parking is a necessary component of driving, it is not the only requirement for being good at driving.
fairgrounds | Knowledge: Livestock competitions are commonly held at fairgrounds, where there is ample space to accommodate livestock and their handlers. Ticket booths are often located at the entrance to such events to collect entry fees, so it is reasonable to assume that the ticket booth in this scenario would also be located at the fairgrounds. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the roadway did not lead towards an urban or populated area, as it is stated to lead away from town. The word "countryside" refers to rural, natural or agricultural areas, and is a natural fit for the direction described in the sentence. The other options may be possible destinations, but there is no clear evidence in the sentence to support them.
book store | Knowledge: A book store is a place where one can buy a variety of books, including poetry books or collections of poems. The other options may also include poetry but are less likely to offer a wide selection or specialize in poetry specifically. A book of poetry and poetry book are essentially the same thing, while literature books may often contain poems but not exclusively, and bookshelves could refer to any collection of books at home or in a library.
new hampshire | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Concord, which is the capital city of New Hampshire. Additionally, the fact that an apple tree was planted suggests that the state is known for apple cultivation, which is a well-known industry in New Hampshire. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
physical contact | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a risk associated with letting children participate in wrestling, which requires parents to sign a waiver. The sport involves constant physical contact between the wrestlers, which can potentially result in injury. The other options, such as sweat or Michigan, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Property damage or strong are not related to the concept of wrestling.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was running late for a class, which implies that they are a student. The sentence mentions that the person forgot their book, which further supports the idea that they are in a classroom setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
you'll sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was very active and energetic, and the speaker promises that eventually, the child will become tired and need to sleep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
nurse | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the baby was thirsty, and the mother took some action to address that need. The most likely and obvious action for a mother to take in this situation is to let the baby nurse, which satisfies the baby's thirst and hunger at the same time. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to the baby's needs or the mother's actions.
purse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady needs to temporarily store a writing instrument while away from home, which is a situation that is commonly addressed by carrying a purse. Purses are often used to carry personal items while out and about, including writing instruments. The other options do not provide a practical or common solution for this situation.
restaurant | Knowledge: The question asks about the type of structure that contains an eatery, implying that the eatery is a type of restaurant. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant, as it directly implies an enclosed structure designed to house a food-serving establishment. The other options, such as eating fast foods and veterinarian, do not imply a physical location or structure in the same way that restaurant or commercial building do.
theater | Knowledge: Opera glasses are typically used to enhance the viewing experience when attending an opera or other live performance in a theater. They are not typically used in theme parks or museums, and while they may be sold in antique stores, this is not the primary use for this item. While some women may carry opera glasses in their purses, this is not the intended use of the item.
airport | Knowledge: The question implies that the location being searched for is related to travel, and specifically for a place to stop before embarking on a long journey. Among the given choices, the airport is the most logical since it is a transportation hub where travelers often have to wait for extended periods before their flights depart. The other options, such as Las Vegas, Public House, Restaurant, and Michigan, are unrelated to the context of the question.
building | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah was in a high-rise building when the fire started, which suggests that the difficult thing for her to escape would be the building itself. The other options (carpet, hallway, obesity, exchange) do not make sense in the context of a fire in a tall building.
office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was required to turn off the electric fan in a specific location, likely due to it being too loud and bothering others in that area. The options "closet", "hallway", "hot room", and "home" do not make sense in this context. "Office" is the most logical choice as it is a place where people work and where the electric fan is likely being used.
suitcase | Knowledge: Razors are commonly used for shaving, which is a daily personal hygiene routine. Therefore, it is likely that a person would take a razor with them on vacation, and the most common place to transport personal hygiene items on vacation would be inside a suitcase along with other toiletries. The other options are less likely places to find a razor while on vacation, with the exception of a medicine cabinet, which may be present in a hotel room or vacation rental. However, the suitcase is still the most likely option.
apartment building | Knowledge: The word "flat" usually refers to an apartment or a unit within an apartment building. Option A (city) and option D (town) are too broad, as flats can be found in both cities and towns. Option B (shoes) is completely unrelated to the question. Option E (London) is also too specific, as flats can be found in many places around the world, and the question does not provide any context to suggest that the location being discussed is London. Therefore, the correct answer is option C (apartment building).
twins | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person (Sarah) was told by her doctor that she couldn't procreate, which indicates that she didn't think she could become pregnant. Therefore, the surprise she experienced must have been related to discovering that she was carrying one or more babies, which is the correct answer - twins. The other options (animals, population increase, venereal disease) are not related to the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect.
utah | Knowledge: The sentence provides a clue that the steakhouse was located near the largest cattle ranch in America, which suggests that it was likely located in a state with a large cattle industry. From the choices given, Utah is the most likely option as it is known for being a major producer of beef and cattle. The other options do not have a significant connection to the context of the sentence.
boy | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the father is trying to teach his daughter a typically masculine activity, throwing a football. The daughter's reluctance to learn and her presumption that her father wants her to be a boy reinforces this idea. None of the other options relate to the gender aspect of the sentence.
Georgia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the brother is attending a school in a southern state known for high humidity levels. The mention of a Bulldog school could also be a hint towards the University of Georgia, which has a famous sports program called the Georgia Bulldogs. The other options either don't have any mention of geography or don't fit the context of a school located in the south.
concert | Knowledge: Large speakers playing music are typically associated with live performances, such as concerts, where the audience is gathered to hear music played by a performer or group of performers. The other options, such as headphones or a desktop computer, do not typically involve large speakers playing music for an audience. The option of a car could be a possibility, but it is less specific than a concert and does not match the context of the sentence as well as the option of a concert.
floor | Knowledge: A bean bag chair is a type of furniture that is designed to sit directly on the floor, without the need for any additional support or structure. It is typically filled with small polystyrene beads or other similar materials that conform to the shape of the user's body, providing a comfortable and supportive seating experience. The other options, such as den, rooms, house, and family room, do not specifically describe a surface that a bean bag chair would sit on.
laboratory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the machine was used for academic or scientific purposes, which is commonly associated with laboratories. Laboratories are known for conducting experiments and research, and often rely on various machines and equipment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
trivial | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher believed that everything mentioned in class was important, but it turned out that the information was only somewhat important for the upcoming quiz. The word "trivial" indicates that the information was not completely useless or insignificant, but rather unimportant in the grand scheme of things. The other options all suggest that the information was completely useless or unimportant.
All of the above options could be correct | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James collected literature, but does not provide information about where he specifically went to obtain it. All of the options listed are plausible choices for someone looking to collect literature. A public library would provide access to a wide variety of books and magazines, while his own home could contain books he has purchased or received as gifts. Shelves could refer to any type of bookshelf, whether in a library or home. Yard sales could be a good option for finding vintage or rare books at a lower cost. Books and magazines could refer to any store that sells those items.
roadblock | Knowledge: A roadblock is a common method used by police to stop cars for various reasons, such as conducting a search, checking for proper documentation, or enforcing traffic laws. The other options such as the park, police station, front door, and street are not typical places for a police officer to stop a car.
party | Knowledge: In general, a party is a social gathering where people often engage in lively and energetic conversation with others. This can lead to the volume of the conversation increasing and becoming loud in order to be heard over music or other background noise. The other options do not inherently suggest that conversation would be more likely to get loud.
go away | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the action of slapping a horse's butt results in it galloping, but the context suggests that this only applies when the person is on the horse. If someone were to slap a horse's butt while they were off of it, it is unlikely that the horse would respond by running quickly or galloping. Instead, it might be startled or frightened and try to move away from the person. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
arizona | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James thought his home was too hot, which can be associated with a hot and dry environment. Arizona is known for its hot and arid climate, making it the most likely option. Farm yards and Michigan do not provide any information about the climate, and the option of a western movie is too general to be a likely answer. South is too broad and could refer to many different locations with varying climates.
tell the truth | Knowledge: The question suggests that someone is going to court for someone they love, implying that the person is taking a morally upright action. Among the given choices, "tell the truth" is the only option that aligns with this moral responsibility. Obstructing justice would be the opposite of the right thing to do in court, while "forgive" and "get" do not make logical sense in this context. "Reproduce" is not related to the context of the question.
restroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the faucet is located in a place where people come in, and the rainbow created by the water is considered annoying and gross, which suggests that the location is a restroom. The other options do not make sense in the context of a faucet spraying water in a confined indoor space.
pick up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mail service does something with packages besides just dropping them off. The phrase "pick up" is commonly used in reference to mail services, indicating that they will collect packages from a location and transport them elsewhere. The other options do not make sense in this context; "open them" would not be a common practice for a mail service and "lift up," "picking up," and "catch" are not commonly used phrases in this context.
South and Central America | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is looking for a specific environment where he can find marmosets. Marmosets are native to South and Central America, which makes this the most likely answer. Grassy field, texas, wilderness, and american tropics do not have any clear connection to marmosets or their habitat.
school | Knowledge: Schools are institutions where students learn various subjects, including geography, math, and history. While it is possible to learn these subjects outside of school through other means such as books or online resources, the context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking where a computer user can learn these subjects. Therefore, the best option would be school, as it is a common place for computer users to access educational resources and online learning materials. The other options do not have any clear connection to education or learning.
New York | Knowledge: New York is widely known as the birthplace of disco, as the music genre originated in the city's underground club scene in the 1970s. Rio de Janeiro is more commonly associated with samba and other traditional Brazilian music styles, while Germany and Town could refer to numerous different locations without any specific musical connections. Hotel does not make sense as an answer choice, as it is not a town or city.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a tense person is trying to achieve a certain state or feeling by listening to soft music. Soft music is often associated with relaxation and creating a peaceful atmosphere, which could help alleviate tension and stress. Therefore, the correct answer is relaxation. The other options, such as hunger or deafness, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
music shop | Knowledge: The other options are all places where a person might play a trumpet, but they are unlikely to sell trumpets to customers. A music shop is the most logical option because it is a place where musical instruments are sold, and a person looking for a new trumpet would likely find what they need there.
armpits | Knowledge: Deodorant is typically used to reduce or eliminate unwanted body odors, particularly in the underarm area. The armpits contain sweat glands and hair follicles that can produce odor when bacteria on the skin break down sweat. Applying deodorant directly to the armpits can help prevent or diminish this odor. The other options do not relate to the context of using deodorant.
clerk | Knowledge: A clerk is a person who works at a front desk or reception area of a business, and is typically responsible for checking people in and out. In the context of a beauty salon, a clerk would likely be the one to greet customers, schedule appointments, and check them in for their services. The other options are not relevant to the context of a beauty salon, with a bellhop typically working at a hotel, a strip mall being a type of shopping center, and "beautifying hair" and "neighborhood" not being job titles or roles.
office desk | Knowledge: The word "occupation" suggests that the item in question is related to work or a job. The other options (nightstand, kitchen cabinet) do not typically have drawers that are useful for work-related purposes. File cabinets and filing cabinets are specifically designed for storing files, so they may have more than one drawer and are less likely to be associated with a single drawer. Therefore, the most likely item with a single drawer that is used during work would be an office desk.
orchard | Knowledge: The question implies that the presence of uneven land would make it difficult for an apple tree to grow in a certain location. Orchards, by definition, are areas where fruit trees are grown, so it is unlikely that an apple tree would not be grown in an orchard. On the other hand, the other options are states or locations that do not provide any information regarding the terrain or climate. Therefore, the correct answer is orchard.
dentist | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is waiting in a place where machines and instruments are being used, which is likely a medical or dental office. The option "dentist" is most closely associated with this context, as it is common to hear the whir of dental instruments in a dentist's office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
garden | Knowledge: Spring is a time of growth and rejuvenation for many plants, making them happiest in a space where they have room to grow and receive adequate sunlight. A garden is a natural environment that provides both of these needs, and is therefore the best choice among the options presented. The surface of the earth could refer to any outdoor space, but does not suggest the additional factors of sunlight and growth that are important for plants in the spring. In the shade and in a greenhouse, plants may not receive enough sunlight to reach their full potential. A park is not necessarily designed for plants to thrive, but rather as a space for recreation and relaxation.
closet | Knowledge: The options "suitcase", "begging", "head", and "lawnmower" are unlikely places to keep an unused hat. A "suitcase" is typically used for traveling and would not be a logical choice for keeping a hat that is not in use. "Begging" has no connection to the context of the sentence. "Head" would be a logical place to keep a hat that is in use, but not for an unused one. Similarly, a "lawnmower" is not a place to keep any type of clothing. Therefore, "closet" is the most logical answer as it is a common storage place for items of clothing.
keep quiet | Knowledge: The question implies that lawyers are known to react in a certain way when they are not treated well at a restaurant. Keeping quiet is a reasonable option as lawyers are often trained to maintain their composure in stressful situations. The other options are not likely to be typical reactions for lawyers in this situation.
family room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat was inside a house since it pawed at a couch and walked in front of a TV. The options "back yard," "residential area," and "bathroom" do not fit this context. The option "comfortable position" may be a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to accurately answer the question. "Family room" is the most appropriate answer because it is a common area in a house where a couch and TV would be found, and where a cat would likely be inside the house.
cover up | Knowledge: When a real estate agent is showing a property that has some sort of issue or problem, they may try to cover it up or hide it from potential buyers. This can include things like painting over water stains, using strategic lighting to hide imperfections, or simply not mentioning certain issues unless specifically asked. The other options all have negative connotations and don't align with what a real estate agent would typically do in this situation.
repair shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tires are part of vehicles that are designed for traveling long distances, which eliminates options like airport and car show. The use of the term "repair shop" implies that the vehicles in question may experience wear and tear on their tires, and may need to have them replaced or serviced periodically. "Black" and "under the bed" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
catch cold | Knowledge: Catching a cold is a common reason why someone may not be able to attend school temporarily. A cold can cause symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat, and coughing, which can make it difficult to concentrate in class and participate in activities. The other options do not relate to physical illnesses or circumstances that could prevent someone from attending school temporarily.
military base | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is at a field hospital, which is usually associated with military bases or locations where there is active military conflict. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Detroit and other cities and towns may have hospitals, but they are not typically referred to as "field hospitals." "Urban area" is also too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location of a field hospital.
become stronger | Knowledge: The question is asking about the purpose of exercise, which is typically to improve physical fitness and strength. The option "tiredness" may occur as a result of exercise but is not the purpose of it. "Use energy" and "exhaustion" may also occur during exercise, but they do not describe the purpose of it. "Depletion" is not commonly associated with exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is "become stronger."
looking up | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people take a certain action when seeing a pretty sky. The most logical action would be to look up at it, as that is the most natural reaction to seeing something in the sky. Outdoors and atmosphere are too broad or general to be the correct answer, place on earth is not relevant to the question, and photo is also an unlikely answer as it suggests that a person takes a photo of the sky rather than simply looking at it.
ground | Knowledge: The question is asking where bacteria is easy to wash off, which implies that some locations or surfaces may make it more difficult to remove bacteria. The ground is a relatively easy surface to wash bacteria off of, as it is typically not porous and can be hosed down or cleaned with soap and water. The other options are less likely to be associated with easy bacterial removal, as septic tanks are closed environmental systems, fingers and hands have crevices and folds that can trap bacteria, and the mouth has a natural microbiome that can make bacterial removal difficult.
become tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that doing housework for a long time can have a negative effect on a person. One common consequence of extended physical activity is fatigue or feeling tired, which is likely the correct answer. Low pay, nice home, boredom, and dizziness are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense as a consequence of doing housework.
downtown area | Knowledge: City halls are usually located in the central business district or downtown area of a city. This is because the city hall is the administrative center of a city where government officials work and make decisions that affect the entire city. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
taking care  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was found guilty of neglecting their child, and as a result, the judge took away the child. The phrase "taking away the child" implies that the judge's decision was related to the welfare and care of the child. The option "taking care" is therefore the most appropriate as it is linked to the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
department stores |  | Knowledge: Leather jackets are a type of clothing item commonly found in department stores, as they are considered a fashion item. It would be unusual to find leather jackets for sale in a grocery store, stable or sex shop. While some car seats may be made of leather, it is not a common way to purchase a leather jacket.
toxicity | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the man passed out due to the consumption of alcohol, which can lead to alcohol toxicity. Alcohol toxicity occurs when there is an excessive amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, which can lead to impaired cognitive functions and even unconsciousness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dispute | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement or come to a resolution, suggesting that they were in a dispute. The other options do not accurately describe the situation presented in the sentence. "Question" implies that the parties were merely unsure of something, "contradict" suggests that they were actively opposing each other's positions, "deny" implies that one party refused to accept the other's proposal, and "asking" does not make sense in this context.
divided | Knowledge: The question asks for a method that will give a smaller result, which suggests that we need to reduce the size of the number. Adding or multiplying positive integers will always result in a larger number, so we can eliminate those options. Written down and start number game do not make any sense in the context of the question. Dividing a positive integer by another positive integer will always result in a smaller number, which makes it the correct answer.
blood | Knowledge: Breaking someone's nose is likely to cause bleeding as this part of the body has many blood vessels close to the surface. Erections, wins, bruises, aches and pains do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not likely to be a result of breaking someone's nose.
respect | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill did not have extreme feelings of either admiration or disdain for the holy man. The word "revere" means to show deep respect or worship whereas "disdain" means to look down upon or despise. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bill had a moderate level of respect for the holy man, which is the best option among the choices. "Honour" and "admire" both suggest a higher level of admiration than what is described in the sentence, while "thankfulness" is not relevant to the context.
bookstore | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is creating a space where people can spend time reading and browsing books. This is a common feature of bookstores, where cozy chairs are often placed in quiet corners and nooks to encourage customers to stay and read. The other options do not have any clear connection to creating a space for reading and browsing.
classroom | Knowledge: The question suggests that the context is related to a place where students might get bored enough to look at the ceiling. While it is possible that this could happen in other locations, such as a house or loft, it is more likely to happen in a classroom where students are expected to sit still and listen to a lecture or read quietly for an extended period of time. Temples and most architectural structures may not necessarily be places where students spend a lot of time getting bored.
grocery store | Knowledge: The question is asking where prepared mushrooms are purchased, suggesting that they have been processed or packaged in some way. The option "refrigerator" does not specify where the refrigerator is located or what it contains, making it an unlikely choice. "Ground" is nonsensical in this context. "Pizza" refers to a dish that can contain mushrooms, but it does not answer the question of where prepared mushrooms are purchased. "Forest" refers to where mushrooms may grow naturally, but it is not a place where they are typically purchased in a prepared form. "Grocery store" is the most logical choice as it is a common retail location where packaged and processed foods, including prepared mushrooms, can be found.
dumpster | Knowledge: Bears are often attracted to human-generated waste, and dumpsters are a common source of food for them. State parks may have designated areas for waste disposal, but it is unlikely that a bear would know to seek those out. A dustbin is a British term for a trash can, so it may not be familiar to all readers. A recycling bin typically only contains materials that are not appealing to bears, such as paper and plastic. "Container" is a vague term that could refer to many different types of receptacles, so it is not a likely answer.
trophy room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John turned on a light and saw a severed gazelle head, which is commonly associated with trophy rooms where hunters display their animal trophies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
listen to radio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a great love of music, but it does not specify that they play an instrument or sing. The most likely activity they engage in while in the car is listening to music, and the option "listen to radio" is the most general and encompassing answer. The other options are specific and may not apply to everyone who has a love for music.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the formerly lonely man chatted with friends for a long time. It is likely that he would feel happiness after spending time with friends and enjoying their company. Tiredness may be a possibility, but it is not the most likely option given that the sentence contains no indication that the man was physically or mentally taxed after the conversation. Communication and agreement are too vague to be the answer, and answers is not a fitting option given that it suggests that the man was seeking responses to specific questions, which is not implied in the sentence.
living room | Knowledge: A fluffy chair typically refers to a comfortable and cushioned chair, often with a soft fabric. The living room is a common area of a house where people sit and relax, making it a likely location for a fluffy chair. The desk and office are typically associated with work and may have more functional chairs. The porch may also have chairs, but they are more likely to be outdoor furniture rather than the plush and cozy chairs that would be found inside a home. "Fluffy house" is not a common term and does not provide any useful information.
explosion | Knowledge: Oxygen is highly flammable, and when combined with a source of ignition, can lead to an explosion. This is a well-known fact and is often taught in science classes or discussed in safety guidelines. The other options do not accurately describe what can occur when starting a fire near oxygen.
dying | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animal was killed, so it is logical to assume that the animal would be in the process of dying. The term "dies" suggests that the animal has already passed away, which contradicts the idea that it was in the process of dying. "Not living" is also not a suitable choice, as it is not a specific action that the animal was taking. "Grief" and "suicide" are unlikely choices, as they are human emotions and actions and not typically associated with animals.
garbage dump | Knowledge: The term "trash" typically refers to waste or unwanted items, which are commonly disposed of in a garbage dump. While trash may be emptied from other locations, such as a dumpster or broom closet, these options are less likely to be a primary location for trash disposal compared to a garbage dump. A state park and subway are also unlikely locations for trash disposal.
backward | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy thinks he is intelligent, but his attitudes are regressive, meaning he holds outdated, conservative beliefs. "Backward" means the opposite of progressive, which fits the context of the sentence. "Ignorant" could also fit the context, but it doesn't necessarily convey the idea of conservatism that is implied by "regressive." "Garish" and "annoying" are not related to the context of the sentence, and "intelligent" contradicts the idea that Billy's attitudes are regressive.
parking lot | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when people are out and about running errands, they need to store their cars somewhere temporarily. While it is possible they may store them at home or a race track, those options are not practical in the given context. Freeways are for driving on, not storing cars, and car shows are events where people display and admire cars, not store them while running errands. Therefore, the most logical choice is a parking lot, which is a designated space for temporarily storing vehicles.
warehouse | Knowledge: The question mentions having a large quantity of steel pens, which would require a larger storage space than a hand, desk drawer, TV stand, or farm. A warehouse would be a logical choice for storing such a large quantity of items.
pleistocene | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the teacher was discussing a prehistoric animal, the mammoth, and the time period in which it lived. The Pleistocene epoch is a well-known geological time period that lasted from about 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago and is associated with the rise and fall of many extinct animals, including mammoths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
yellow pages | Knowledge: The yellow pages are a traditional phone directory that lists businesses and their contact information, including their hours of operation. Therefore, if someone needed to find out the hours that a business, such as Marmot, is open, it would be logical to consult the yellow pages. The other options, such as a hiding place or the ocean, are unlikely places to find information about a business's hours.
suburbs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the back courtyard is a common feature found in every house in the neighborhood. The options "palace" and "country estate" suggest expensive and luxurious properties, which would not be common features of every house in a neighborhood. "Poor suburbs" may not necessarily have back courtyards, and "large house" does not necessarily imply the presence of a back courtyard. Therefore, "suburbs" is the most likely correct choice as this is a common feature in neighborhoods of this nature.
ranch | Knowledge: The word "ranch" is commonly associated with cattle and livestock, as it is a place where animals are raised for meat production. Therefore, it is likely that the question is referring to where in the country beef cattle are most commonly raised on ranches, which would make "ranch" the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
tensions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Seth have a problem, and John is taking legal action against Seth. The word "tensions" implies a rising level of conflict between the two parties, which is a likely outcome when one person sues another. The other options do not necessarily fit the context: "going to court" is already stated in the sentence, "resentment" may already exist and not necessarily increasing, "verdict" refers to a legal outcome and not a relationship dynamic, and "civility" is the opposite of tensions and not an appropriate answer in this context.
being happy | Knowledge: The verb "getting" combined with the noun "gift" suggests that the outcome of receiving a gift will be positive. The phrase "you wanted" reinforces this idea, indicating that the gift is desired and will likely bring joy. The other options, such as disappointment and anger, have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of receiving a desired gift. Headaches is also not a likely outcome of receiving a gift.
arthritis | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan was unable to play chess anymore because he had been debilitated by something. The word "debilitated" implies that it's a serious condition that prevents him from doing what he enjoys. The option "arthritis" is the most likely answer because it's a medical condition that can affect a person's ability to move their joints, including their hands for playing chess. The other options - boredom, humility, frustration, and headaches - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
clear | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James chose glass walls because they allow more light into the room. This implies that the glass walls are transparent or clear so that light can pass through them. The other options, such as "inventive," "half empty," "recyclable," and "very fragile," do not have any relevance to the sentence and are not likely to be the reason why the glass walls let light in.
dull | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sky affected the color in some way, indicating that the original beauty of the day may have been diminished. The word "overcast" also implies a lack of sunlight, which would further support the idea that the colors were not as vibrant as they could have been. "Dull" is the most appropriate choice as it accurately describes a loss of brightness or vibrancy, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
captivity | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam valued his ability to make his own decisions and do as he pleased, which is a common attribute associated with freedom. Being a prisoner of war would severely limit his freedoms, making the desire to escape a natural response. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
gills | Knowledge: Gills are the organs that enable fish to extract oxygen from water, so they are essential for their survival. Fish are not able to breathe air like land animals, which means that they must have specialized respiratory structures to extract oxygen from their watery environment. Bones, tail, and no legs are physical features of fish, but they are not directly related to oxygen exchange. "See work" is unrelated to the question.
added responsibilities | Knowledge: The verb "procreating" implies having children, and the sentence suggests that after doing so, some people struggle with something that leads them to turn to the government for assistance. The phrase "added responsibilities" is a common way to describe the challenges that come with having children, such as financial burdens, time constraints, and other lifestyle changes. The other options may also come with added responsibilities, but they are not directly connected to the context of the sentence.
convention center | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was on a business trip for a company-sponsored event. It is common for companies to hold events at convention centers, which are designed to accommodate large groups for meetings, conferences, and trade shows. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as business interviews could take place anywhere, Michigan is a state and not a specific location, resorts are typically associated with leisure travel, and cities could refer to any urban area.
house | Knowledge: The phrase "used by a single family" suggests that the entrance hall in question is part of a private residence rather than a public building or institution like a school or large building. The options "person" and "mansion" are more specific types of houses that could also have an entrance hall used by a single family.
plate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for guests and has arranged cookies on something. It is common to arrange cookies on a plate when serving them to guests, which makes "plate" the most likely answer. The other options are unlikely because a jar may not be big enough or appropriate for cookies, a house is not a place to set out cookies, a mouth is not something to set out cookies on and a hubcap is not typically used for serving food.
on purpose | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Sean intentionally made a mistake on the test, ruling out options such as "accident" and "correction". The word "torment" does not seem appropriate in this context, and "success" and "correct answer" are unlikely to be the reasons for intentionally making a mistake on a test. Therefore, "on purpose" is the most appropriate answer.
pressing keys | Knowledge: Typing involves the physical act of pressing keys on a keyboard to input letters and characters into a computer or other device. While thinking and having a nice keyboard may be helpful, they are not essential to typing. Digital dexterity, or the ability to use one's fingers in a coordinated and precise manner, is important for efficient typing. Speed is also a desirable skill for typing, but it is still secondary to the primary action of pressing keys.
person's body | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about human nerves, which are found in the human body. The other options (possum, animal, organism) are too broad and could refer to a variety of different organisms. Fingertips are a part of the human body, but the question is asking about nerves in general, not just in a specific part of the body.
deep thought | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human is thinking deeply about something, which is a common expression used to describe being in a state of deep thought. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
swim | Knowledge: Jellyfish are marine creatures that live in the water, specifically in the ocean. Therefore, it can be inferred that people may swim in the same place where jellyfish live. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
bathroom or medicine cabinet | Knowledge: Toothpaste is commonly used for oral hygiene, so it is likely to be found in places where people brush their teeth. The bathroom and medicine cabinet are both common locations for storing toothpaste. The sink may also be a possible location, but it is not as specific as the bathroom or medicine cabinet. The kitchen and mouth are unlikely locations for toothpaste as it is not typically used for cooking or to be kept in the mouth for an extended period of time.
coffee shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to coffee since it mentions a "cup of hot brew" and a "free refill." The word "little" suggests that the customers liked something about the coffee shop specifically. The other options don't seem to fit the context as well, as they are not necessarily associated with coffee or free refills.
hockey rink | Knowledge: The question refers to people who use a puck for their living, which is a clear reference to ice hockey players. Ice hockey is played on a hockey rink, and it is where players typically go at the end of their work day. The other options do not align with the context of the question.
post office | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Danny wrote an address on the box, suggesting that he intends to send it somewhere. The most logical place for him to take the box in order to send it would be the post office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
constantly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim talked without pause, which indicates a continuous or uninterrupted pattern of speech. The word "constantly" is the best choice to describe this rate of talking, as it means without stopping or pausing. The other options may have some overlap in meaning, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence. "Always forever" is repetitive and redundant, while "all day" suggests a specific time frame rather than a pattern of behavior.
children's story | Knowledge: The word "young people" suggests that the reading material is likely to be aimed at children or young adults. Weasels are common characters in children's stories and fables, so it is likely that young people would read about them in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
vinegar | Knowledge: Mary is suggesting an alternative to salt that can add flavor to John's salad. Vinegar is a common ingredient used as a salad dressing and can add a tangy flavor to the dish. Peppers, black pepper, and cured meat are not commonly used as salad dressings, while "adding flavor" is too vague and not specific to the context of the sentence.
rock wall | Knowledge: Lizards are known to be skilled climbers, and rock walls provide the perfect surface for them to grip onto and climb up. The other options do not provide a suitable surface for lizards to climb on - a stream bed would be too wet, a plane is too smooth and flat, a garden may have plants but not surfaces for climbing, and the great outdoors is too broad and doesn't specify any particular surface.
restroom | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location people would go to after they pick up some food to buy in a store. The most common reason people would need to leave the area after picking up food is to use the restroom. The other choices do not have any relevance to the context of the question.
getting dirty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mom is watching her children play in the rain and expects them to get dirty as a result. "Getting dirty" is the only option that directly relates to this context. "Being dirty" and "get messy" are not appropriate because they are not happening yet, and "get messy" may not necessarily be related to getting wet in the rain. "Getting wet" is a possibility, but since the focus is on the children getting dirty, it is not the best answer.
amusement park | Knowledge: The question suggests that the map is for a specific type of location that can only be accessed on foot. Amusement parks often have maps that show the locations of various rides, attractions, and amenities that can only be reached by foot. Neither the cafeteria, classroom, truck stop, nor gas station have anything to do with locations that can only be walked to.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the need to walk while playing the trumpet, which suggests a marching band. Marching bands typically perform while marching in parades or on a football field during halftime shows, and members must be able to play their instruments while moving. The other options do not involve walking and performing at the same time.
slurred speech | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's speech was difficult to understand after getting drunk, which is a common symptom of slurred speech. Slurred speech is a condition where the person's speech is slow, distorted, and difficult to understand, which can happen when the person's brain is affected by alcohol. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
aerobic | Knowledge: Jumping rope is a popular form of aerobic exercise that involves continuously jumping up and down while swinging a rope under your feet. Aerobic exercise is known to have various health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. The other options, such as smiling, pleasure, and sweating, do not have a clear connection to how jumping rope can affect your body above your shoulders.
frightening | Knowledge: The context suggests that large guard dogs are being discussed and it is likely that people feel fear or intimidation when they see them because of their size and reputation for being protective. The option "anxious" could also be possible, but the word "frightening" is a stronger and more direct choice. The options "fleas" and "found outside" are not relevant to the question, and "faithful" does not accurately reflect the emotional response people have towards guard dogs.
nightmares | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dreaming scary things can result in a negative feeling upon waking up. Nightmares are commonly associated with unpleasant or frightening dreams, which is the most likely result of dreaming scary things. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
controversy | Knowledge: While art can have many positive effects, such as promoting communication and providing a sense of pleasure or recognition, it can also be controversial. Art can challenge societal norms, provoke strong emotional reactions, or be interpreted in different ways by different people. This can sometimes lead to controversy, criticism, or even censorship of the art.
community chest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the game being discussed includes various types of spaces, such as "chance" and another type that is similar in nature to "chance". The only option that fits this description is "community chest", which is a space on the board where players draw a card that may grant them rewards or penalties based on chance. The other options ("sure thing", "skill", "for sure", and "bingo") do not match the context of the sentence.
ugliness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having "beauty" is contrasted with something else. Since "beauty" is a positive descriptor, it makes sense that the opposite would be something negative, such as "ugliness." The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
string quartet | Knowledge: Classical stringed instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass, are commonly used in classical music, particularly in orchestral and chamber music settings. A string quartet is a type of chamber ensemble that consists of four stringed instruments (two violins, a viola, and a cello) and is typically used to perform classical music compositions. The other options, including concert, music store, rock band, and barbershop, are not typically associated with the use of classical stringed instruments.
able to hear | Knowledge: The question suggests that the speaker wants to listen to the movie, which implies that they need to be able to hear the movie's audio. Paying attention, closing eyes, being very quiet or telling someone to shut up may help with focusing on the audio, but they do not help with the main goal of listening to the movie.
excitement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother is looking forward to going somewhere and getting a whole new house to decorate. The word "excitement" is the most appropriate answer since it conveys a positive emotion that is consistent with the context of the sentence. The other options may not be as relevant or appropriate given the context.
financial center | Knowledge: Banks are often concentrated in specific areas known as financial centers, where other financial institutions and businesses are also located. This concentration allows for easy access to banking services and financial expertise for businesses and individuals in the area. Main streets may have some banks, but they are less likely to have a large concentration of them. City, subway station, and grocery store do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
turn around | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that yelling is meant to redirect a person who is going in another direction. Turning around is the most logical action to take in response to the sudden loud noise, while the other options do not make sense in this context.
recording studio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mixer works with a band, which is a common activity in a recording studio. The comparison to a NASA engineer in a control room implies that the mixer has a high level of control over the sound, which is also a characteristic of a recording studio. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
knee injury | Knowledge: The question implies that playing basketball carelessly may result in a negative outcome. Knee injuries are a common occurrence in basketball, especially when players are not cautious and accidentally twist or hyperextend their knees. Losing or having fun are not necessarily negative outcomes and sweating and pain may not be directly related to playing basketball carelessly.
library of congress | Knowledge: The question specifies that it is asking about a building in Washington D.C. that has the most books. The Library of Congress is a well-known building in Washington D.C. that also happens to be the largest library in the world. It contains millions of books, manuscripts, maps, and other documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that doing housework is a physically demanding activity, which can lead to exhaustion or feeling extremely tired. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Boredom and arguments are emotional responses that are not necessarily related to physical labor, while magic powers and headache are unlikely outcomes of doing housework.
ability to fly | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a common trait shared among most birds. One of the most notable characteristics of birds is their ability to fly, which is made possible by their wings. While some birds may not have the ability to fly, such as flightless birds like penguins and ostriches, the majority of birds are known for this distinctive feature. "Beak" is a physical characteristic, while "learn to fly" is not necessarily shared by all birds.
lies | Knowledge: Perjury involves giving false testimony under oath, which is essentially lying while under legal obligation to tell the truth. The other options do not accurately or directly relate to the act of perjury. Joining a jury, for example, is not related to perjury at all.
no longer exist | Knowledge: Atheists typically believe in the finality of death, and that there is no afterlife or continuation of consciousness after the body dies. The options "unable to work," "born again," and "body decays" do not accurately reflect this belief, while "no longer exist" and "would cease to exist" suggest the idea of non-existence after death.
death  | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequence of living for an extended amount of time, which is commonly associated with aging and ultimately, death. Palpitations and perspiration are medical conditions that may occur during life but are not directly related to the extended nature of living. Making friends is a social activity that may occur throughout one's life but is not related to the duration of life.
go to school | Knowledge: The word "dreaded" suggests that the child was afraid or unhappy about something. The phrase "fall and having to" implies that there is an event or action that the child is not looking forward to. Among the given choices, only "go to school" fits this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the phrase "fall and having to."
rural area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cow farms have an unpleasant odor, which is why they are typically located away from populated areas. The term "rural" refers to areas that are sparsely populated and generally characterized by agriculture and farming, making it the correct choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
making music | Knowledge: Playing a musical instrument, such as the guitar, is usually associated with creating or making music. It involves learning how to strum or pluck the strings to produce different sounds and notes. While listening to music may inspire someone to pick up the guitar, the purpose of actually playing it is to make music. Arthritis and obesity are health conditions that are not directly related to playing guitar, and singing refers to a separate activity that may be combined with guitar playing, but is not the main purpose.
body part | Knowledge: A hand is a body part that is located at the end of the arm and is used for grasping, holding, and manipulating objects. It has fingers and a thumb that allow for fine motor movements such as writing and typing. The other options do not accurately describe what a hand is.
make haste | Knowledge: To accomplish something in a short amount of time, one would need to move quickly and efficiently. The phrase "make haste" means to hurry or move quickly, which would be appropriate in this situation. The other options do not relate to completing a task quickly, for example "make trouble" would have the opposite effect of hindering progress.
flirt | Knowledge: The word "attraction" implies a romantic or sexual interest, which typically involves flirting as a precursor to other physical displays of affection such as hugging and kissing. "Love else" and "love another" do not make sense in the context of the question and are not commonly associated with initial romantic attraction.
outsides | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a bench seat, which typically has seats on either side and a middle seat. The youngest person in the group is always stuck in the middle seat, suggesting that she never gets the "outsides" of the bench seat. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence - "left" and "right" are specific positions that don't necessarily relate to the bench seat, "window" is a feature that may or may not be present, and "extremes" and "outer" don't really have any clear connection to the sentence.
red lobster | Knowledge: Red Lobster is a well-known chain restaurant in the United States that specializes in seafood dishes, which matches the items listed in the question (crab, shrimp, and fish). The other options do not relate to seafood or dining, and therefore can be eliminated as choices.
ruling | Knowledge: The phrase "bringing suit" typically refers to initiating a legal action or lawsuit. The likely "end" or outcome of such a legal action would be a ruling, typically by a judge or jury, which would determine the outcome of the case. The other options, such as tensions, randomness, swimming, do not make sense in the context of legal action or lawsuit. "Going to court" is a close option, but it is not as specific as "ruling" which directly relates to a legal decision made by a court or judge.
inside of a house | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that clouds are something that typically occurs outside and not inside of a structure such as a house. The other options (top of a mountain, ground level, air, and sky) are all places where clouds are commonly seen or expected to be seen.
america | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the freeway is a country that uses miles instead of kilometers as its primary unit of measurement. America is one such country, as the United States uses miles for long distances on its freeways and highways. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence, making them unlikely candidates for the correct answer.
getting tired | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Friday was being interrogated for ten hours, which implies that he was likely experiencing fatigue from answering questions for such an extended period. The option "sharing information" is unlikely because the sentence suggests that Friday didn't want to answer questions. The options "rich" and "teaching" are unrelated to the context of the sentence, and "boredom" does not accurately capture what Friday was feeling.
music store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Joe is a musician who needs a replacement cymbal for his instrument. Out of the given choices, a music store would be the most likely place to find cymbals for sale. A marching band typically uses a specific type of cymbal that may not be suitable for Joe's needs, and a symphony orchestra typically does not use cymbals as extensively as a drumkit musician would. Furthermore, a grocery store would not carry musical equipment.
verdict | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James only wore his suit to court when he heard a certain thing. The most logical reason for this would be that he was only willing to dress up for a momentous occasion, such as a verdict being reached in his case. The other options do not provide a reason for James' behavior.
doctor's office | Knowledge: The phrase "routine checkup" suggests that the question is related to a medical appointment. A needle is commonly used in a medical setting for blood tests or vaccinations, which are typically done during a checkup at a doctor's office. The other options, such as "sewing basket," "eat cake," and "haystack," do not relate to the medical context of the question. While a hospital may also have needles, a routine checkup would typically be done at a doctor's office.
forest | Knowledge: The mention of a tree and other trees surrounding it suggests that the bald eagle made its nest in a wooded area, most likely a forest. Forests provide ample opportunities for bald eagles to build their nests and find prey, making it a common habitat for these majestic birds. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable habitat for a bald eagle.
peel | Knowledge: The sentence refers to the part of the apple that is left behind after eating, which suggests that the answer should be a part of the apple itself. The grocery store and farmers market are locations where apples can be purchased, and the stems and seeds inside are parts that are typically removed before eating. The peel, however, is typically left behind after eating an apple and discarded.
say hello | Knowledge: Saying hello is a common greeting used when meeting someone for the first time. It is a friendly way to acknowledge someone's presence and start a conversation. Smiling and shaking hands are also common greetings, but the sentence specifically mentions the person saying hello. Goodbye is not a suitable option as it is used when parting ways, while greet is too broad and does not provide enough context.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place that sells eggs along with many other types of food, which is a characteristic commonly associated with supermarkets. Supermarkets typically offer a wide range of food products, including eggs, and are common places for grocery shopping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
word sentence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is struggling with expressing their thoughts using proper language, which indicates a difficulty with constructing sentences. This implies that the person may not know how to choose the right words to convey their meaning effectively. Therefore, the correct answer would be "word sentence". The other options do not address the issue of expressing thoughts with proper language.
even | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for the opposite of an odd number, which is a mathematical concept. In math, even numbers are defined as numbers that are divisible by 2 without a remainder, while odd numbers are not. Therefore, the opposite of an odd number is an even number. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of even and odd numbers.
yard  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog did not venture far from the house to find the stick, as the man could tell it came from a nearby small area. The options "grass", "forest", and "woods" suggest a larger and more distant natural area. "Yard" and "outside" are more likely to refer to the immediate surroundings of the house, but "yard" is the more specific and likely option, as it implies a defined and managed area adjacent to the house where the stick could have come from.
library | Knowledge: Old newspapers are often kept for reference and historical purposes, and libraries are common places to find them. Libraries often have archives of newspapers that go back several years and are available for public use. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
rest area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that travellers need a place to stop and take a break from driving, specifically to stretch their legs. A rest area, also known as a rest stop, is a designated location along a roadway for motorists to rest, use the restroom, or take a break from driving. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not provide a place for motorists to stretch their legs during a road trip.
used car lot | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person who is a weasel tends to work in a certain type of employment. Used car lots are often associated with the stereotype of being places where dishonest or tricky sales tactics are used, which may be why a person who is compared to a weasel would be associated with this type of workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gain knowledge | Knowledge: Learning about a subject is typically done with the goal of increasing one's understanding and knowledge in that area. The other options do not align with the typical motivations for learning, as "change" is too broad and could apply to any activity, while "elation" and "headache" are emotional states that are not direct outcomes of learning. "Boredom" may be a common feeling associated with unengaging materials, but it is not a goal someone would have when seeking information.
wall | Knowledge: When considering what is usually next to a door, the options of apartment, office, building, and kitchen do not give any indication of what would be physically located next to a door. However, the option of wall is a logical choice as walls are typically adjacent to doors. Therefore, knowing that walls are commonly found next to doors can help in selecting the correct answer.
boat | Knowledge: Fish are often scared of boats since they can pose a threat to their safety by disturbing their natural habitat, creating waves that may upset their balance or scare them, or accidentally catching them with fishing equipment. The other options may not necessarily pose a threat to fish, and some may even be favorable to their survival, such as a pond or stream, which provide a natural environment for them. A market or end of line are irrelevant in this context.
commercial area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe had trouble with city zoning laws, which indicates that the problem was related to the legal requirements for businesses in a particular area. The phrase "neighborhood barbershop" implies a small, local business, which may need to conform to specific zoning regulations that restrict the type of businesses allowed in residential or commercial areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
upstream | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person moved down the river while their partner remained behind. The word "upstream" indicates a direction opposite to the flow of the river, which would be where the partner remained. The other options ("upstairs," "inside," "over," and "above") do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
commit crime | Knowledge: The word "killing" is commonly associated with causing death or taking a life, which is often considered a crime. While there may be other actions associated with killing such as feeling anger or laughing in certain contexts, the most direct and accurate answer is to "commit crime" because it directly relates to the act of taking a life. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
supermarket or bank vault | Knowledge: The word "spend" suggests that the person is looking for a place to use their money. Supermarkets and banks are places where people typically spend money, either on groceries or financial transactions. Car shows and art shows are not necessarily places where people would spend money, as they are more for browsing and admiring than purchasing. A water fountain is not a place where people typically spend money at all.
business plan | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the executives were discussing something related to their work, as they were walking through the lobby. The option "business plan" is the most directly related to this context, as it refers to a plan for a company's future success. The other options, such as "opera," "office building," "receptionist," and "game plan," are not directly related to the context of the sentence and are therefore less likely to be correct answers.
plate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the food is already prepared and ready to be eaten, which suggests that it is most likely already on a plate. The other options may be places where food is stored or prepared, but they are not the last step before consumption. The stomach is technically where the food ends up after being eaten, but the question asks about the last place before being eaten.
lobby | Knowledge: The reception desk is typically the first point of contact for visitors to a business, and it is usually located in the lobby or entrance area of the building. The lobby is the area where people enter the building, and it often contains seating areas, a reception desk, and other amenities such as restrooms and vending machines. The other options do not make sense as a location for a reception desk in a business context.
praising | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was critical of his own team while doing something else with the opponents. The word "opponents" implies that the subject is involved in some sort of competition or game, and if he is critical of his own team, it is unlikely that he would be trivializing or dismissing the importance of the game. Furthermore, the word "praising" suggests a positive evaluation, which would contrast with the negative criticism directed towards his own team. The other options either have a negative connotation or do not provide a clear contrast to the subject's critical evaluation of his own team.
jazz club | Knowledge: A lounge lizard is a slang term for someone who frequents lounges or bars, often dressed in fancy or flashy clothing. Since jazz clubs are a common type of lounge, it makes sense that a lounge lizard would like to hang out in a jazz club. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they are not places where lounges or bars would typically be found.
grow food | Knowledge: The question is asking for the cheapest way to get food. Stealing is illegal and not a viable option. Purchasing food from a specific website may not necessarily be the cheapest option, as prices can vary. Eating in this context is not a method of obtaining food. Working for food may be a possibility, but it may not always be the cheapest option. Growing food can be an affordable way of obtaining food, especially if done at home or in a community garden. Therefore, the correct answer is "grow food."
skepticism | Knowledge: The term "skepticism" is often used to describe an attitude of questioning or doubting something. This implies that the person is not completely convinced or has reservations about the truth or validity of the thing in question. The other options, such as "doubt" or "disbelief," may have similar connotations, but "skepticism" is the most precise answer that fits the context of the sentence. "Deny" and "depression" do not fit the context at all.
attend school | Knowledge: The question implies that Bill is looking for a way to learn from a teacher, which makes attending school the most logical choice. While reading a book can also provide knowledge, it does not offer the opportunity to ask questions or receive personalized guidance, which Bill may desire. Memorizing or understanding better are actions that require prior knowledge or materials, which Bill may not have access to. Church may offer some educational opportunities, but attending school is a more direct and comprehensive way to learn.
fire | Knowledge: A mobile heat source is something that can be moved to different locations to provide heat. Out of the given choices, only fire meets this criteria as it can be created anywhere with the right materials and provides heat when burning. A bedroom, solar energy, and coal or wood are not typically mobile heat sources, and a car may have a heating system but is not considered a heat source itself.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person wants to buy food items, which suggests they should go to a place that sells groceries. The term "grocery store" specifically refers to a retail store that sells food and household items, making it the most relevant option among the choices. The other options, such as "refrigerator," "horse's mouth," "desert," and "greengrocer," do not make sense in this context.
exhilaration | Knowledge: The word "diving" suggests that the activity was more intense than just sightseeing. The question also implies that the activity was chosen for a specific reason, as opposed to just being a means to get from one place to another. The word "exhilaration" suggests that the people were diving through the cave for a thrill or excitement. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
texas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah went to a restaurant that specializes in the cuisine and atmosphere of the American West, which is a cultural region that includes states like Texas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
louisiana | Knowledge: The word "swamp" typically refers to a wetland area characterized by waterlogging, which is commonly found in Louisiana. Additionally, Louisiana is known for its alligators and snakes, making it a likely place to find a snake in a swamp. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
cafe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James looked at a menu and placed an order, which implies that he is at a place where food and drink are being served. Of the options given, a cafe is the most likely location for this to happen, as cafes typically have menus and serve food and drink. The other options, such as a shop, internet site or advertisement, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
brown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that many horses are brown in color, and mentions a common misconception that their milk might taste like chocolate because of their color. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Texas | Knowledge: The word "heifer" suggests that this question is referring to a female cow, which is commonly raised for meat and dairy. Texas is known for its large cattle industry, with over 13 million head of cattle, making it the largest cattle producing state in the United States. Therefore, it is likely that the attitude of the heifer is a reference to the temperament and behavior of Texas cattle. The other options do not provide any context or clues as to why a heifer's attitude might be associated with a particular state or location.
wide | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the area being referred to is located between two significant bodies of water (oceans) and land masses (continents). Therefore, it is more likely that the area is wide in extent rather than narrow or limited. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
communication | Knowledge: The use of the word "talking" in the sentence suggests that the therapist is referring to the need for better communication between the individuals. The therapist is likely suggesting that the first step in improving their relationship is to talk and communicate effectively with one another. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stomach | Knowledge: The process of digesting food begins in the mouth, where food is broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva. From there, it travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where enzymes and acids break down the food further before it moves into the small intestine for absorption. The other options, such as pantry, kitchen, and plate, do not accurately refer to a part of the digestive system where food is processed.
market | Knowledge: The word "fresh" implies that the tomatoes have not been stored for long periods of time, and instead have been recently harvested. Therefore, it is likely that the freshest tomatoes can be found at a market or farm stand, where they are sold shortly after being picked. The other options such as pizza, squashed or even the refrigerator do not guarantee fresh tomatoes, and the phrase "on pizza" is not a location where the tomatoes can be found but rather where they may be served.
get tired | Knowledge: The sentence implies that standing in line all day can be physically exhausting. This makes "get tired" the most likely answer, as the other options do not relate to physical fatigue. "Learn a new way to bake bread" and "order" are not activities that typically result from standing in line for an extended period of time. "Tiredness" is very similar to "get tired" and may also be a suitable answer, but "get tired" is more specific in describing the action that is likely to occur. "Fidgeting" may be a result of being restless from standing in line for too long, but it does not describe the overall physical impact on the body.
save money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is concerned about losing value when he does something specific. This implies that James is experiencing inflation, which is causing the value of his money to decrease over time. The best option among the choices is "save money" because saving money allows James to preserve its value, even in the face of inflation. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not address the issue of inflation.
storybook | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fox saw itself wearing silly clothes on a piece of paper, which likely indicates that the fox was looking at a representation of itself in a printed or drawn medium. This is most commonly associated with storybooks, which often feature animal characters wearing clothing and engaging in anthropomorphic activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
improve yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person felt pride after improving their mile time, indicating that they put in effort to train and become better. The options "paint house," "compete against," "tell many people about," and "pass class" do not have any clear relationship to the context of feeling pride after improving one's mile time.
kitchen | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Nate washed his personal silverware and put it away in a place where it would be easily accessible for future use. The most logical location for this would be the kitchen, where plates, glasses, and other utensils are typically stored. The other options (bedroom, table, restaurant, and cupboard) are less likely to be the location of where Nate stored his silverware.
sexually transmitted diseases, aids, unwanted pregnancy | Knowledge: Having sex without protection puts individuals at risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of unwanted pregnancy, which can lead to emotional, physical, and financial consequences. While sex may feel pleasurable in the moment, it is important to consider the potential consequences and take steps to minimize risk. The choice "bliss" does not accurately reflect the potential consequences of unprotected sex.
student union | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bookshop specializes in course texts, which are typically used by students. The option "student union" is the most relevant choice because it is a common gathering place for students on a college or university campus, and would therefore be a natural location for a bookshop specializing in course texts. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laboratory | Knowledge: A laser is commonly used in scientific and research settings, such as in laboratory experiments for physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is not commonly used in cd players, aircraft, hospitals, or cdrom drives, which eliminates those options.
dissatisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that fighting inflation has a negative impact on the public, which is likely to lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction. Inflation often leads to higher prices and reduced purchasing power, which can be frustrating for consumers. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence.
make music | Knowledge: The verb "fiddling" typically refers to playing the violin, so the most appropriate answer in this context would be "make music". Dancing about, bluegrass music, and drop are not related to the act of playing the violin. While "playing" is technically correct, it is not as specific or contextual as "make music" in this sentence.
nostalgia | Knowledge: The phrase "evening of remembering" suggests a time of reflecting on the past, which often leads to nostalgia. Nostalgia refers to a sentimental longing for the past, which is a common feeling when remembering past events or experiences. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the act of remembering or reflecting on the past.
drinking alcohol | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the action being described is the act of drinking alcohol to the point of becoming intoxicated. The term "getting drunk" specifically refers to the effects of alcohol consumption, and the other options listed are synonyms or technical terms for alcohol, but do not capture the meaning of the phrase in the sentence.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James installed curtains in his own personal space in order to block out light from a particular source, which is likely his television. Therefore, it is most likely that he hung his curtains in his own house rather than at a show, grocery store, department store, or theater which would not be his personal space.
change quickly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean was not counting on the weather to stay nice because he knew it could change quickly. This implies that the weather in the area is known to be unpredictable and prone to sudden shifts in conditions. The other options either do not fit with the context of the sentence or are not supported by any information provided.
food store | Knowledge: The question suggests that the context is related to obtaining a bean as an ingredient for cooking or consumption. While some of the options such as cooking pot, coffee, and beantown are associated with beans, they do not provide a clear solution to obtaining a bean when you don't have one. Neighbor may seem like a viable option, but it is not the best solution as it may not be practical to ask for a bean from a neighbor. The most practical and obvious option is to go to a food store where you can purchase a bean.
physical exertion | Knowledge: Hiking is a physically demanding activity that requires a lot of energy and effort. The word "utilize" in the question suggests that the answer is a type of action or process, rather than a specific location or condition. "Mountain" and "adventure" are not types of exertion, while "exercise" is too broad and could apply to any physical activity. "Shin splints" is a condition that can result from hiking, but it is not a type of exertion itself. Therefore, "physical exertion" is the most appropriate answer.
fire | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that prisoners were employed to do a specific task that would be helpful in fighting something. The options "work for," "sack," "lay off," and "make redundant" do not make sense in this context. "Fire" is the only choice that fits with the idea of fighting something, and digging lines can be a technique used to contain or control a fire.
recycle bin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the job involves collecting cardboard, which is a commonly recycled material. The use of the phrase "special needs" may indicate that the company was specifically looking to hire someone with a disability or other special circumstances, and the task of collecting cardboard from a recycling bin might be a good fit for someone with certain physical or cognitive challenges. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gain experience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student took an unpaid membership for a reason. One possible reason for taking an unpaid membership is to gain experience in a particular field (e.g. volunteer work). Taking notes and studying books do not necessarily require a membership, and capitalist exploitation does not make sense in this context. "Listen carefully" might be a plausible option, but it is less likely than "gain experience" given the word choice in the sentence.
gain information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the topic being discussed is science and that the person being referred to enjoys learning about it. The phrase "like learning about" implies a desire to acquire knowledge, which is most closely associated with "gain information." The other options do not reflect a desire to obtain knowledge about science. "Experiment" and "invent" suggest actively doing science rather than learning about it, while "frustration" has a negative connotation that does not fit with the positive tone of the sentence. "Smiles" is a vague option that does not provide any meaningful information.
fruit basket | Knowledge: The question is asking for a suitable container for giving a grape as a gift. Out of the options provided, a fruit basket would be the most appropriate choice for presenting a single grape as a gift. A kitchen or field would not be suitable containers, and a bowl of fruit may be too large or contain other items that could detract from the singular grape as a gift. A box could be an option, but a fruit basket would add a decorative touch to the gift presentation.
antique shop | Knowledge: The word "expensive" suggests that the lantern is valuable and therefore likely to be sold in a location that specializes in selling expensive or rare items. An antique shop fits this description as it typically sells vintage and valuable items. The other options, such as a collector's house or a dark place, do not necessarily imply that the lantern is expensive, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
differentiate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man and the woman were unable to distinguish or differentiate between reality and lies. The word "likened" suggests that they compared their experience to something else, implying that they may have been mistaken or misled in their perception of what happened. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
take medicine | Knowledge: Taking medicine is a common method for treating illnesses and recovering from sickness. On the other hand, throwing up and exercising may not always be recommended or effective methods for recovery. Battling cancer requires a combination of treatments and a longer period of time compared to a regular illness, which makes it an unlikely choice for this question. Finally, "get better" is not a concrete action or method that a sick person can take to actively aid in their recovery.
drawer | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John was searching for a shirt, which is an item of clothing typically kept in a drawer. The other options - closet, chest, dresser, and suitcase - may also contain clothing but are less commonly associated with storing shirts specifically. It is important to consider the context and associations of each option to make an informed choice.
banking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the automaton wants to save money like normal humans, which indicates that it needs to learn about a financial system. Banking is a logical choice because it refers to the system of conducting financial transactions, such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds, that is commonly used by humans. The other options, such as museum or science fiction plot, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
understanding of | Knowledge: The sentence states that James's first priority was finding information, indicating that he was seeking knowledge or a better understanding of something. The other options, such as "exciting" or "gratification," do not align with the purpose of seeking information for understanding. "Hatred" and "thoughts" are also not relevant to the context of the sentence.
cupboard | Knowledge: The question refers to a mouse being found in a box, which typically suggests that the mouse is inside a container or enclosure. Out of the given choices, a cupboard is the most likely place where a box containing a mouse could be found because cupboards are commonly used to store household items and are often enclosed spaces. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
play piano | Knowledge: The question specifically asks for something that can be used to play music. The only option that directly relates to playing music is "play piano." The other options have no clear relationship to playing music, for example: "listen" is what you do when you hear music; "skate" is an activity that is unrelated to music; "fiddle" is a type of stringed instrument, but not all fiddles can play all types of music; and "have fun" is a general phrase that is not specific to music.
everything | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government has a tendency to impose control on various aspects of society or individuals, hence the word "anything." The other options don't fit, as they're either specific places (Washington D.C.) or too general (country and all of us) and don't provide the same level of specificity as "everything."
good health | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having blemish-free, flowing skin is a characteristic commonly associated with good health. This is because good health often results in clear skin and a healthy complexion. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
frame | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that needlepoint requires multiple accessories, one of which is used to hold the work taut. A frame is a common accessory used in needlepoint to keep the fabric stretched tightly while working on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
street | Knowledge: Policemen are typically responsible for patrolling specific areas, such as neighborhoods or business districts. They ensure that laws are being followed, respond to emergencies, and maintain public safety. Patrolling a street is a common duty for police officers, while the other options have no clear connection to the role of a police officer.
guest room | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the individuals are hosting guests and apologizing for the sleeping accommodations. This suggests that there is a designated guest room in the house, and that the sofa bed is a temporary solution for extra guests. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a basement, garage, or hotel would not typically have a sofa bed for guests, and horseradish is not related to the topic at all.
evening | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah had to reschedule the meeting because she couldn't make it in the afternoon. She then promises to skip dinner and go to bed early, implying that the meeting will take place later that same day. Based on the options given, the most likely time for the meeting to be rescheduled to would be in the evening, after dinner. The other options (before noon, morning, before lunch) do not make sense given the context of the sentence.
carved | Knowledge: The question is asking about how the shape of wood can be changed. Nailing usually does not change the shape of the wood but only attaches it to another piece of wood. Grinding and polishing can shape and smooth the surface of wood, but not its overall shape. Warping refers to the wood bending or twisting due to changes in humidity or temperature. Carving, however, refers to the act of removing pieces of wood to alter its shape, making it the correct answer to the question.
bookstore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is purchasing a magazine and taking it home. While a library can also provide access to magazines, they are not typically sold and taken home by patrons. "Bed" and "airport" are unlikely options as they do not typically sell magazines, and "shop" is too generic to make an assumption about the type of store. A bookstore is the most likely option since they typically sell magazines and allow customers to take them home after payment.
convoluted | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer given was not what the professor was expecting and that he/she was expecting something more complex and difficult to understand. The word 'convoluted' means complex and difficult to follow, which makes it the correct answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply a more straightforward and serious approach.
sense of wonder | Knowledge: The question is asking about the potential effect of learning about science. One possible outcome is that it can inspire a "sense of wonder" as someone learns about the amazing complexity and interconnectivity of the natural world. This option is supported by the fact that science often reveals new and fascinating phenomena that can inspire awe and curiosity. The other options (scientific knowledge, intimidation, boring, become educated) are all possible outcomes of learning about science, but they do not necessarily capture the emotional response to this knowledge.
eating fish | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions that there is an aquarium, which is likely to have fish in it. Since cats are natural predators and often hunt fish in the wild, it is likely that they are looking to eat the fish in the aquarium. The other options like heat, play, drink water, and come to dinner do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cemetery | Knowledge: A cemetery is a place where people are buried, often with headstones or other markers to commemorate their lives. Therefore, it would be a logical place to visit a monument to a deceased loved one. The other options do not have any explicit connection to death or memorials.
airport | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are waiting for a vehicle to arrive, which is a common occurrence in airports where people wait for their flights or for someone to pick them up. People may sleep in a chair due to long layovers or delays, and this is a common image associated with airports. The other options, such as bedroom or desk, do not have any clear connection to people sleeping in chairs while waiting for a vehicle.
people dying | Knowledge: Waging war often involves violent conflict and the use of weapons, which can result in the death of individuals involved in the fighting. This is a common and well-known consequence of war, whereas heartache, evil, and suffering are more abstract concepts that may be associated with war but do not directly describe a tangible result. Killing people is also a possible consequence of war, but it is more specific than people dying and may not always occur in every war.
sit still | Knowledge: The phrase "on the move" implies movement or mobility. The option "sit still" directly contradicts this movement, making it the correct answer. The other options are either synonyms (stationary, stand still, stay still) or describe a type of movement (running), which do not fit the context of the question.
state facts | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are two different approaches to communicating, with one preferring to lie and the other preferring to do something that is the opposite of lying. The last option, "state facts", aligns with this opposite approach, as stating facts is typically associated with being honest and straightforward. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence and are not opposites of lying.
music store | Knowledge: The question is asking where you can find the most variety of oboe brands, so the most likely place to find a wide selection would be a music store. Orchestras and bands may have oboes, but they would typically only have a few select brands for their players to use. A case is not a location where oboes are sold, and Guitar Center is a store that specializes in guitars and other stringed instruments, so it is less likely to have a large selection of oboes.
sea water | Knowledge: Blowfish are marine animals that can typically be found in the ocean, so the correct answer would be a location related to the sea. The other options, such as the jungle, Cuba, or a lake do not have any connection to the habitat of blowfish. The Atlantic Ocean is a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "sea water," which directly relates to where blowfish are commonly found.
backpack | Knowledge: The question suggests that the drink needs to be transported from one location to another, which indicates that it should be placed in a container that can be carried easily. Of the options given, only 'backpack' fits this criteria as it is a type of bag that can be used to carry items. The other options - cup, cabinet, cardboard box, and stumble - do not seem like practical choices for storing a drink during transportation.
make trouble | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described has a negative impact on someone else's life. Baking biscuits or making progress are unlikely to have negative consequences for someone else. Making haste or taking time may affect one's own life but not necessarily someone else's. "Making trouble" is the only option that implies the action makes life harder for someone else.
look beautiful | Knowledge: The sentence provides a contrast between the previous reports of bad weather and the actual weather on the wedding day, which is described as gorgeous. This suggests that the weather must have improved and looked beautiful on the day of the wedding. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect the improvement in weather.
pennsylvania | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about a place in the US with a lot of mines. Knowing that mines are typically associated with extraction of natural resources like coal, oil, and minerals, it is reasonable to eliminate options like ground, cambodia, and mine craft game. Additionally, mountains are often associated with mining activities, but may not necessarily have a lot of mines. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, has a strong history of coal mining, making it a likely answer choice.
fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Charlie is focused on experiencing something that makes him feel good and wants to make the most out of it. The only option that fits this context is "fun." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
department store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy stole a cheap item, which is commonly found in department stores. Jewellers typically sell high-priced items such as gold, diamonds and precious stones. The guard tower and police station are unlikely places where watches would be sold. A bedroom drawer is a place where people keep their own belongings, not where one would go to shoplift.
university  | Knowledge: The question is asking where the person can ride their bike in order to take graduate classes, implying that they want to ride their bike to a location where they can attend classes. The options "schoolyard" and "street" do not necessarily suggest a location where one can attend classes. "Netherlands" is a country and therefore does not provide a specific location. "Bike path" may suggest a route to take, but does not indicate a specific destination for taking classes. "University" is the best answer because it directly relates to attending classes and is a common location for graduate studies.
pharmacy or drug store | Knowledge: Contraceptive devices are typically sold at pharmacies or drug stores. These stores usually have a section dedicated to sexual health and family planning, and may offer a variety of options such as condoms, birth control pills, and diaphragms. It is unlikely that a person would give you a contraceptive device, and it is not appropriate to obtain one from an adult squirrel or a bedroom.
hockey game | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the scene is taking place in a location where glass is present and that there are people causing a disturbance nearby. Of the options given, only a hockey game is commonly associated with both glass (as in the barriers around the rink) and rowdy fans who might bang on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
death | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker is willing to fight their enemy even if it means risking their own life, which is a common expression. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that customers have the option to shop outside, which is typically only found in a mall with outdoor shopping areas. A market may have outdoor vendor stalls, but it is usually not considered a place where customers can shop outside in a recreational sense. The ocean does not have any connection to shopping, and neither does a restaurant or a bookstore.
discomfort | Knowledge: Nightmares are often associated with negative emotions such as fear and anxiety, which can leave a person feeling uncomfortable or unsettled even after they wake up. While it is possible that a person may experience a headache or shock after a nightmare, discomfort is the most general and likely answer given the context of the question. The other options do not fit with common experiences associated with waking up from a nightmare.
park | Knowledge: The phrase "in the ground" suggests that the flower is located outside, rather than in a vase or on a windowsill. A park is a logical place to find a flower growing naturally in the ground. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
will laugh | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the conversation among friends is lighthearted and nostalgic, so it is likely that someone will share a funny or amusing anecdote which will result in laughter. The other options (exchanging information, agreement, staring, social approval) do not fit with the context of the sentence.
livingroom | Knowledge: The context suggests that the comforter was used for snuggling in front of the TV, which is an activity typically done in a living room or family room setting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The washing machine would be used to clean the comforter, the cedar chest would be used for storage or display purposes, and outside and bedroom are unlikely options for a cuddling blanket.
go fishing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to fishing, and the question is asking about what one needs to do to bring fish home. The correct answer is to go fishing, as that is the activity that involves catching fish. The other options do not relate to fishing, or do not make sense in the given context.
keep accounts | Knowledge: An account book is typically used to keep track of financial transactions, such as income and expenses. It is commonly used by individuals and businesses alike to maintain accurate records for budgeting, tax purposes, and financial planning. The other choices do not relate to the purpose of an account book. A desk drawer and purse may be used to store the book, but they do not describe its function. A bank is a financial institution, not a tool for tracking financial records, and keeping track of emails is a different activity altogether.
classroom | Knowledge: The use of the term "Socratic dialogue" suggests that the discussion was taking place in an educational setting, as Socratic dialogue is a method commonly used in classrooms to facilitate critical thinking and exploration of ideas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of a discussion using Socratic dialogue.
civilization | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the listed characteristics are associated with a particular type of human population. The options "country" and "city" are too broad and do not encompass all of the listed characteristics. "Canada" and "citizen" are specific to a country, and are not related to the context of the sentence. "Civilization," on the other hand, is commonly used to describe a society with advanced institutions, technologies, and a system of record-keeping. Planned cities and workers are also commonly associated with civilizations. Therefore, the correct answer is "civilization."
television program | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "Discovery" and "starring a shark," which suggests that the question is referring to a TV program by that name. The other choices are geographic locations or weather phenomena, which do not fit with the context of a TV program.
band | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the singing human is likely part of a musical group or ensemble. A band is a common musical group that includes a singer, so this would be the most logical answer. The other choices - aircraft, outer-space, space shuttle, and factory - are not typically associated with singing humans in a musical context.
falling down | Knowledge: The phrase "on the ground" implies that the person in the sentence is physically lying on the ground, which is often the result of falling down or sustaining an injury. "Peace" and "forgetfulness" do not seem to relate to physical actions that would result in someone being on the ground, while "death" is too extreme for the context given.
imprisonment | Knowledge: In most states in the United States, including Washington, stabbing someone to death is considered murder and is punishable by imprisonment. Capital punishment (the death penalty) is only applied in certain cases and is not the default punishment for murder. Killing and hurt are too vague to be valid options, and enlightenment is not a punishment at all.
day dream | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John enjoyed making up stories or scenarios in his mind, which is a characteristic commonly associated with daydreaming. Daydreaming involves creating vivid mental images or fantasies, which can be a fun and entertaining way to pass the time. The other options may be related to pretending, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
mountains | Knowledge: The mention of snow suggests that the tourist was likely in a colder climate or area that experiences snowfall. The options of Canada and mountains both fit this description, as Canada is known for its cold winters and mountainous regions also commonly experience snow. The option of roof doesn't make sense in the context of capturing pictures of snow, and the repetition of ground as an option is likely an error.
problems  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who are stressed tend to have issues with remembering things. Stress is known to affect cognitive abilities like memory and attention, which can result in forgetfulness or difficulty recalling information. The other options do not have a direct correlation to the topic of stress and memory.
countryside | Knowledge: The fact that the bald eagle avoided big cities suggests that it preferred to be in areas with less human population and development. The option "countryside" refers to rural areas that are typically less populated and developed than cities. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
top of mountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lilly was seeking solitude and a peaceful environment, which is commonly associated with being away from other people and noise. The option "top of mountain" provides the most logical choice for this type of setting as it is away from the hustle and bustle of daily life and provides a peaceful and secluded atmosphere. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
enough | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the reason the job was not finished was not due to a lack of effort but rather a lack of something else. The word "enough" suggests that the supplies may have been insufficient to complete the job. "Possessing" does not fit the context of the sentence as it refers to ownership rather than availability. "Plethora" suggests an abundance of supplies, which contradicts the idea that the job was not completed due to a lack of supplies. "Satisfaction" does not fit the context of the sentence as it does not relate to the completion of the job. "Availability" supports the idea that the supplies were not accessible or present, but "enough" is a better fit because it indicates that even if the supplies were available, they were not sufficient to complete the job.
trash | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James disposed of his paper coffee cup after crushing it, which means he must have put it in a bin or bin-like container. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence, as leaving a crushed cup on a coffee table or desk, putting it in a cupboard, or leaving it at Starbucks would not be considered its "proper place."
pee | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being teased was mistaken for a girl because they were caught sitting down in the locker room bathroom. This is typically associated with bathroom activities such as using the toilet or urinal, and in this case, the correct answer is "pee". The other options do not make sense in this context.
earth | Knowledge: The phrase "third rock from the sun" is often used to refer to the planet Earth, which is the third planet in our solar system. Minerals are naturally occurring substances found on Earth, so it makes sense that the correct answer is Earth. The other options, such as Nebraska, multivitamin, and Michigan, do not have any association with minerals or the context of the sentence. The word "ore" is associated with minerals, but it is too vague on its own and could refer to any planet or even asteroids or moons.
opera | Knowledge: The word "opera" refers to a type of musical theater that features singing as its primary mode of expression. Therefore, it is likely that people would sing in an opera setting. Singing is not typically expected or encouraged in other locations such as an apartment, supermarket, train station, or conference.
broken bones | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person's fear of skiing is related to an accident they had previously experienced. It is common for skiing accidents to result in broken bones, so the person likely wants to avoid this type of injury in general. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
evil | Knowledge: The sentence implies that waging war is often viewed in a negative light, as it is considered to be something. The use of the word "evil" directly implies a negative connotation, whereas the other choices (suffering, killing people, people dying, a party) do not necessarily convey the same negative meaning.
geography | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the science major is interested in digging in the earth, which is a common activity in geography when studying soil, rocks, and landforms. Additionally, the favorite class of the science major is mentioned, and geography often involves the study of physical geography, including things like geological formations and topographic maps. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dog's mouth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reward was intended for a dog, as bones are a common treat for dogs. The phrase "give a bone" also implies that the human was presenting the bone to the dog as a gift or reward. Out of the given choices, only "dog's mouth" is directly related to the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "skeleton" and "human body," do not make sense in this context.
This question is inappropriate and offensive, and I will not provide a response.
big | Knowledge: The word "opposite" in the question implies that we are looking for a word that has the opposite meaning or is antonymous to "little." "Big" is the best option for the opposite of "little" as it has an opposite meaning and is commonly used to describe something that is large or of a considerable size. The other options either do not have a clear opposite meaning to "little" or are unrelated choices.
bag | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane carried her related literature with her when she entered the room to speak with others, which implies that she kept it in a bag. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although people have different desires in life, there is something common that they all ultimately seek. The phrase "a little bit of" may indicate that this is something relatively small or subtle. Out of the given options, happiness is the most likely candidate as it is a commonly sought-after emotion that can be experienced in small amounts. The other options are either too specific or do not fit the overall tone of the sentence.
trivial | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the statistician and demographer had different opinions about the importance of an anomaly. The use of the word "contrarian" implies that the demographer is likely opposed to the statistician's view. The word "trivial" means unimportant or insignificant, which fits with the demographer's opposition to the statistician's view. The other options are not necessarily opposites of important and do not convey a clear sense of the demographer's perspective.
separate things | Knowledge: The word "sort" implies that the person wants to organize or categorize a pile of things. The only option that relates to this is "separate things," which suggests that the person needs to sort the pile by placing similar items together or creating distinct categories. The other options do not have any clear connection to sorting, organization, or categorization.
plate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to eat the food immediately, which implies that it needs to be put on a surface that is suitable for consuming food. Cups and jars are typically used for liquids or smaller items, while the kitchen and pantry are locations rather than surfaces to put food on. Plates are the most common surface for placing and eating food, so it is the correct answer.
own objects | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people with money often want to acquire things, which is commonly associated with owning objects. Selling items and selling food may be related to making money, but they do not necessarily imply the desire to want things. Telling the truth and learning from each other do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
burger king | Knowledge: Flame-broiling is a cooking method used by Burger King, whereas McDonald's usually fries their hamburgers. The sentence suggests that the hamburgers were served at a fast food restaurant, so options such as "hockey game" are unlikely choices. "Cooked on grill" is a general description rather than a specific location, leaving "Burger King" as the most logical answer.
get married | Knowledge: Getting married is a common way to start living life with someone else and forming a committed relationship. Making love, having children, and learning can all be part of a relationship, but they do not necessarily involve a formal commitment or legal agreement. Going to jail is not a positive or relevant option in the context of starting a life with someone else.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the medication mentioned can relieve symptoms, which suggests it is meant to treat physical conditions or ailments. The word "pain" is commonly associated with physical discomfort or suffering, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are either unrelated or do not involve physical symptoms.
public building | Knowledge: The use of the word "laws" implies that this is a regulation that applies to a wide range of establishments, suggesting that it is a legal requirement. The word "public" also indicates that the law applies to places that are open to the general public, which would include buildings like schools, hospitals, and government offices. The other options may or may not be required to have a fire extinguisher, depending on the context, but there is no clear indication that they are required by law like public buildings.
lose weight | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the doctor gave the man dietary advice, specifically to eat vegetables. The phrase "it would help him" implies that the doctor advised the man to eat vegetables for a specific purpose. The option "good for" is too generic and could apply to any number of health benefits associated with vegetables. "Wash" and "starve" do not make sense in this context. "Fibre" could be a possible answer as vegetables are high in fiber, but the doctor's advice seems more geared towards weight loss.
unconventional | Knowledge: The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that has a meaning that is the opposite of normal. The other options may have negative connotations, but they don't necessarily mean "opposite of normal." "Unconventional," on the other hand, means "not conforming to accepted norms or standards," which could be interpreted as the opposite of normal.
hardware store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to buy a new screw to fix the problem with the kitchen drawer knob. This would require a hardware store, where they could find a wide selection of screws and other tools and hardware items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have experiences | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a fundamental difference between the actions of the living and the dead, and that this difference is important. The options "talk", "sometimes bad", "pollution", and "happiness" do not seem to fit this context. "Have experiences" is the most logical answer, as it is something that only the living can do. The dead cannot have any new experiences, as they are no longer alive.
company | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was lacking something to lead, which implies that he needed a group of people to lead. The options "army" and "school" could also fit this description, but the context of the sentence ("useless") suggests that James' lack of something to lead made him incapable of being a leader, and leading an army or school would actually require a strong leader. "Battle" and "organization" do not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, "company" is the best choice as it fits both the context of the sentence and the implied meaning.
cold | Knowledge: The sentence states that a virus causes the flu and the common "what." The word "what" indicates that we are looking for a noun that is commonly associated with the flu virus. The options "disease" and "infection" could be correct, but they are too general and don't specifically relate to the flu. The option "make person sick" is too broad and does nothing to help us identify a specific word. The correct answer is "cold," because the flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses caused by viruses.
rain forest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being referred to has borders and a large population, which rules out options like treetops and research laboratory. As for the remaining options, monkeys are often associated with the rain forest due to the fact that many species of primates live in the jungle canopies of places like the Amazon rainforest. South Africa may seem like a possibility because it does have borders, but it is not typically associated with monkeys as much as other parts of Africa. Kentucky does not have any connection to the context of the sentence as it does not contain a large population or any notable monkey populations.
pool table | Knowledge: The sentence describes a game played with a stick and balls, suggesting a game of billiards or pool. The phrase "hit a ball into other balls" specifically relates to the act of breaking the rack of balls at the beginning of a game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jigsaw puzzle | Knowledge: The context of the sentence is referring to fitting one piece with another, which is a common action in a jigsaw puzzle. A puzzle box could also involve fitting pieces together, but it is not as commonly associated with the action as a jigsaw puzzle is. Chess pieces are not typically fitted together, and a plate does not involve fitting pieces together in the same way a jigsaw puzzle does.
headaches | Knowledge: The phrase "too intensely" suggests that there may be negative consequences associated with studying excessively or with too much focus. The word "headaches" specifically suggests a physical symptom that is commonly associated with stress or eye strain, which could be caused by studying for extended periods of time without taking breaks or looking away from computer screens. The other options do not relate to the negative effects of intense studying.
other teachers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher interacts with someone regularly during the week, and it indicates that this person is part of the same profession as the teacher. The phrase "other teachers" is the only option that directly relates to the profession of teaching, making it the most likely answer. The other options either refer to a different type of interaction or are not connected to the context of the sentence.
purse | Knowledge: The question specifies that the person is a woman and wants to bring a writing instrument with her. This suggests that the writing instrument needs to be portable and easily carried around. The most common place for women to carry small items like pens or pencils is in their purse. The other options do not make sense in this context: a stationery store is a place to buy writing instruments, not store them; a ball stopped is not a place to store things; a pocket may be an option for some women's clothing, but it's not universal; and a classroom is a location, not a storage option.
cup water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill's hands are capable of doing different things, and that he was thirsty. Therefore, it makes sense that he would use his hands to pick up a cup and get a drink of water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
salt | Knowledge: In pioneer times, salt was commonly used for food preservation. It helps to prevent bacteria growth and can extend the lifespan of certain foods. Barrels might have been used for storage, but they are not necessarily associated with food preservation in this context. Checkers is a game and has no relation to food preservation. Baking soda and water might be used for other purposes but are not typically used in food preservation.
Concordance | Knowledge: When you agree with someone, you are in a state of concordance, meaning you have reached a mutual understanding or agreement with them. Nodding or shaking hands are physical gestures that can signal agreement, but they do not fully capture the concept of concordance. "Asking them did we just become best friends?" and "become closer" are not accurate descriptions of what happens when you simply agree with someone.
isolation | Knowledge: The sentence describes the person studying apes and implies that they will be living in a certain condition for months. The word "isolation" makes the most sense in this context, as living in isolation is a common practice for researchers who study animals in the wild. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
raise hand | Knowledge: In a busy restaurant, customers often raise their hand to get the attention of their waiter or waitress. Waiting in line is typically done when entering a restaurant or when waiting to be seated. Taking a number is typically done at fast-food restaurants or delis where customers have to wait for their order. Paying bills is done at the end of a meal, while ordering dinner is done at the beginning. Therefore, raising his hand is the most likely option for James to do in this situation.
transportation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person drove their car for a practical reason, which suggests that transportation is the most likely answer. The other options (car crash, death, sleepy, stress) do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not provide a logical explanation for why someone would drive their car.
Minnesota | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker took a toll road and ended up in a state that they couldn't spell, which indicates that the state's name is likely complex or difficult to spell. Out of the options given, Minnesota is the most complex name to spell. The other states have more straightforward spellings. Additionally, the option "Eastern United States" is not a state and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
class room | Knowledge: The question is asking about a goal that a student would have to improve in, a goal that would most likely be related to their academic performance. The options "kindergarten class," "kitchen," and "library" do not relate to academic performance, while "every aspect of life" is too broad and could apply to anyone, not just a student. Therefore, "class room" is the most appropriate answer choice as it suggests the goal would be to improve academically in a school setting.
diminishment | Knowledge: The phrase "area of elevation" suggests that the sight being observed is likely a high point or overlook, which may create a feeling of being smaller or diminished in comparison to the vast expanse below. The option "disgust" does not align with the context of the sentence, while "jealous" and "reduction" do not have any clear connection. "Depression" could be a possible choice, but it does not specifically relate to the idea of diminishment in this context.
kitchen | Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to make food, which implies that the food is being prepared from scratch rather than being purchased ready-made. The most logical place for this to occur is in a kitchen, which is designed specifically for cooking and food preparation. The other options are unlikely to be the best place to make food - supermarkets are for shopping, tables are for eating, and stomachs are for digesting. While restaurants do have kitchens, they are not necessarily the best place for individuals to make their own food.
cabinet | Knowledge: The question asks about a place to store extra sheets of paper, which implies a need for storage space. A cabinet is a common piece of office furniture used for storing papers and documents, making it a likely choice for storing extra sheets of paper. The other options do not have the same storage function as a cabinet, with a printer being a device for printing rather than storing, a box and cutting/folding being temporary solutions, and "office" being too broad and not specific enough to answer the question.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman had difficulty recalling her wedding day, but when she did remember it, she experienced a particular emotion. The details provided do not provide any direct hints as to what that emotion might be, but given the context of a happy wedding day, it is reasonable to assume that the emotion would be positive. The option "pleasure" best fits this assumption, as it suggests a joyous or satisfying feeling. The other options ("hunger," "knowing," "depression," and "knowledge") do not seem to fit the context of the sentence or the general tone of a happy wedding day.
great relief | Knowledge: The phrase "long lost" implies that the painting was missing for a significant amount of time, and the fact that Van Gogh "felt" something suggests an emotional response to its discovery. "Great relief" is a common expression used to describe a feeling of release from anxiety or stress, which would make sense if Van Gogh had been searching for the painting for a long time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the emotion it conveys.
water garden | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the tomatoes were not thriving, which could be due to a lack of water. Therefore, the logical next step would be to water the garden to try and save the dying plants. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is at a residential location and needs to borrow a common household item such as sugar. The most likely place to find this item would be at a neighbor's house rather than an office, theater, gas station, or wall. Additionally, the use of the word "chuckled" implies that the person knows the neighbor well enough to find the situation somewhat humorous, further supporting the idea that they are borrowing sugar from a nearby neighbor.
clothing store | Knowledge: The term "body coverings" suggests an item of clothing, which can be found at a clothing store. A phone booth is unlikely to have body coverings, and a workplace or swimming pool may have uniforms or specific clothing requirements, but these would not be referred to as "body coverings." Closets typically contain clothing, but the question is asking where a human can find body coverings, rather than where they might store them.
hang out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity one would like to do with friends is something casual that does not require a specific plan or agenda. "Hang out" is a common phrase used to describe this type of social activity. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "talking about" and "meet for lunch" suggest a specific plan, while "bond with each other" and "side with" do not fit the casual nature of the sentence.
love another | Knowledge: The sentence implies that attraction is not instantaneous, but that it can develop over time. The phrase "grow to do" suggests a gradual process rather than a sudden one. The other options have different connotations that do not necessarily relate to developing attraction over time, such as "flirt" and "kiss."
music | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is typically considered beautiful to hear. The word "usually" suggests that there may be exceptions, but in general, the answer will be something that is pleasing to the ears. The option "concert hall" could be a possible answer if the question specified that the context was related to experiencing music live. However, the other options are unlikely to be considered beautiful sounds, with "chainsaw" and "movie" being particularly jarring and unpleasant. "Mouth" could possibly be a correct answer if the context was specified, such as beautiful singing or speaking, but without any additional information it is too broad.
open eyes | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can be seen when using television but is not necessary to use television. The only option that fits this criteria is "open eyes," as it is possible to watch television without actively looking at the screen. The other options are all related to the process of using a television, such as plugging it in, finding the remote control, or turning it off (kill).
stage fright | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is anxious about performing, which is a common symptom of stage fright. Stage fright is a type of performance anxiety specifically related to performing on a stage, in front of an audience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mosquito | Knowledge: Mosquitoes are known for feeding on the blood of animals and humans, which they collect by puncturing the skin with their mouthparts and sucking up the blood. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence; while the human body contains blood, it does not "collect" it in the way that the sentence suggests. The needle and blood bank may be involved in collecting blood, but they are not alive and therefore cannot be said to "collect" anything. The slaughter house may involve the collection of blood from animals, but this is not the primary purpose of the facility.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that young people are getting lessons, which suggests an educational setting like a classroom. The dictionary is likely nearby to provide support for the students' learning. The other options, like a friend's house or a shelf, do not suggest an educational context. A table could be a possibility, but it is less likely than a classroom or library as a location for formal learning.
kindness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Susan had a negative personality trait, but despite that, she was capable of displaying a positive one. The choices "mean cruel" and "nice" are both synonyms for each other, and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Friendly" may suggest a different aspect of Susan's personality that is not relevant to the sentence, while "generous" is not necessarily associated with displaying positive behavior towards others. "Kindness" is the best option as it represents a positive personality trait that contrasts with Susan's known negative trait.
hotel room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bed has been used by many people, which would be typical of a bed found in a hotel room. Mattress stores typically sell new bedding, rest areas do not typically have beds, apartments and lofts would usually have private furnishings, and while a hotel room may also be an apartment or loft, these spaces are not typically used by many people.
plane | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James lost a return ticket and was unable to get a replacement, which likely means he missed his flight back home. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that James was frustrated and couldn't get a replacement suggests that the ticket was necessary for his return travel, which reinforces the idea that he missed his flight.
heavy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opposite of "light" in this context is a word that describes something having a considerable weight. "Crucial" and "darkness" do not relate to weight in any way, and "cumbersome" implies that the object is difficult to handle or move, but not necessarily heavy. Therefore, "heavy" is the most appropriate choice.
hardware store | Knowledge: The question is asking where to buy an electric fan, which is an appliance commonly found in homes and used to cool down a space. While it's possible to purchase some household items like fans online or in electronics stores, hardware stores are more likely to carry a wide variety of fans designed specifically for home use. Saunas, closets, and computers have no clear connection to the context of the question.
furniture store | Knowledge: The sentence provides a context of wanting to take home a night table, which implies that it is something that can be purchased. The most likely place to buy furniture is a furniture store. The other options do not make sense in the context of purchasing furniture.
table | Knowledge: The question suggests that we are looking for something that can be placed next to a side chair to create a comfortable place to read and drink coffee. An office or library may have chairs, but they are unlikely to have a table next to them. A building or coffee shop may have tables, but the question specifically asks about something that can be put next to a chair. Therefore, the best answer is table.
gym | Knowledge: The sentence specifies "before gym," which implies that the changing room is for changing into workout clothes. While some of the other options may also have changing rooms, such as a clothing store or department store, these options are not explicitly related to going to the gym. The option "change baby's diaper" is also unlikely as it specifies a specific task rather than a location. "Schools" is a less likely option as well, as students typically change clothes for physical education classes rather than before going to the gym outside of school hours.
smile | Knowledge: The sentence states that Marcy did not want her parents to know that she was sad, so it is logical that she would try to conceal her emotions. The options shed tears, sobs, and talk all involve expressing emotion, which goes against what Marcy is trying to do. Laughing is also too volatile and unpredictable and may draw attention to her behavior. Therefore, the only sensible option left is to smile, which can be seen as a socially acceptable way to interact with others without revealing one's true emotional state.
sierra nevada mountains | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions, and the Sierra Nevada mountains are a well-known mountain range in California. While California is in North America, this answer is not specific enough since marmots can be found in other mountainous regions throughout North America. Similarly, the Great Outdoors is a vague and broad term that could refer to any natural environment. Los Angeles is a city and not known for its wildlife, making it an unlikely choice.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence describes living in a small village outside of a city, which suggests a rural setting. Rural settings are often characterized by open spaces, natural landscapes, and less densely populated areas. The term countryside refers specifically to rural areas outside of urban centers, making it the correct answer option. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they either refer to specific regions or locations within larger geographic areas.
church or cathedral | Knowledge: Religious statues are often displayed in places of worship such as churches and cathedrals. These religious institutions typically have a history of commissioning and displaying religious art, including statues. Museums may also display religious art, but they are not typically associated with religious worship. New York City and Central Park do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where many tables are set with silverware rolled into napkins that are nicely presented. This is a common practice in restaurants, where tables are often pre-set with utensils and napkins in an organized and aesthetically pleasing way. The other options (silver, park, table, and cupboard) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mall | Knowledge: The word "escalators" implies a set of moving stairs commonly found in places such as malls or department stores, where people are transported to different floors or levels. "Motion" and "bringing people up" are too broad and do not specifically relate to escalators, while "vacuum bay" is not relevant to the question.
It's impossible to know which answer is correct without additional context or information about the cat's behavior and preferences.
building | Knowledge: A post office is a physical location where mail is sorted, processed, and distributed. It is usually located in a building specifically designed for this purpose, which may be in the center of a town or city, in a business district or other area where there is high foot traffic. Deliveries are not typically made from a post office location, so that choice can be eliminated. While a post office may be located in the center of town or city, it could just as easily be located in another part of the area, so those options are not specific enough to be correct.
airport | Knowledge: A flight bag is typically brought to an airport, as it contains items necessary for travel such as passport, boarding pass, and any personal items that are not carried in a larger suitcase. The other options, aircraft, aeroplane, and airplane, refer to the vehicle used for air travel rather than the location where the flight bag is to be brought. "On your lap" is not a suitable answer because it does not make sense in the context of the question.
do arithmetic | Knowledge: The sentence implies that computers rely on a system of binary digits (or bits) represented by ones and zeroes. This system allows computers to perform complex calculations and execute instructions using a combination of logical operations, which can be referred to as arithmetic. The other options do not accurately capture the complete range of tasks that computers are capable of performing using binary code.
take notes | Knowledge: Attending a lecture typically requires active listening and note-taking in order to absorb and retain information. Falling asleep during a lecture would not be a productive use of time, and "learning" is too broad of an answer as it encompasses any method of acquiring knowledge. "Falling asleep" and "falling asleep" are redundant options, and the correct answer "take notes" aligns with best practices for effective learning during a lecture.
moving fast | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is running away from an assailant, which suggests that his purpose for running is to move quickly and get away from danger. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for why he would be running in this particular situation.
information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was searching for something online but could not find it, indicating that what she desired was information. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as food and water, acknowledgment, freedom of information, and freedom of expression are not related to the act of searching for something online.
stillness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teenager was struggling to understand the concept of motion and stillness. The word "grasping" implies that the teenager was having difficulty comprehending this idea. The phrase "even if he laid there" suggests that the teenager was lying down and observing the world around him. The word "stillness" directly contrasts with the idea of motion, which makes it the most fitting answer. The other options also relate to the concept of being still, but they do not have the same direct relationship to the contrast between motion and stillness.
honor | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker respects the man's bravery, despite disliking his actions. "Honoring" someone often implies showing respect or admiration for their actions despite differing opinions or beliefs. "Admiring" and "revering" can also denote respect, but "honor" carries a stronger connotation of respect in the face of disagreement. "Loving" and "adoring" do not fit the sentence's context.
out of doors | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that ferrets are found in the wild before they are captured. "Out of doors" is a phrase commonly used to describe things found outside, particularly in natural environments like forests, fields, and wilderness areas. The other options (hutch, tree house, North America, Rocky Mountains) do not fit the context of the sentence, as hutch and tree house imply captivity, and North America and Rocky Mountains are geographic locations rather than a description of where ferrets are found.
legs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sitting down was difficult and unstable, indicating that there was an issue with the stability of the object being sat upon. The reference to "all four" suggests that this object had four legs, and that they were uneven or unstable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Flatulence, chair and comfort are not related to the physical stability of the object, while the option to "sit on" is redundant with the context of the sentence.
using soap | Knowledge: Bathing typically involves using soap or some kind of cleansing agent to remove dirt and sweat from the body. The other options listed (suntan lotion, reading newspaper, slip and fall) are not essential components of bathing, and cleanliness is implied by the act of bathing itself.
state park | Knowledge: State parks often have strict regulations in place to protect natural resources such as trees, wildlife, and water sources. Therefore, trees are more likely to be protected in a state park compared to other options such as a tree store or orchard where trees may be grown for commercial purposes and may not be as strictly regulated. Forests and countryside areas may have some protection, but it is typically not as strict as in a state park.
whisper | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person had to make a call in the middle of the night, which suggests that they were likely in a location where they needed to be quiet. Using a whisper would be the most effective way to communicate without disturbing others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the need for quiet communication.
better life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to improve their current situation or circumstances by achieving something that will make them happier. "Better life" is a commonly used phrase for this purpose. "American dream" is a specific term used to describe the belief that anyone can achieve success and prosperity through hard work and determination, but it does not necessarily refer to a specific action the person is taking. "Complimented" and "headache" are irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and "own house" is too specific to be the correct answer for this general question.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is going to work with a boss they dislike, which can create a tense and uncomfortable environment leading to stress. Boredom and exhaustion are emotions more commonly associated with a lack of engagement or excitement in a task, while teamwork is a positive collaboration between colleagues. Anger could be a possible emotion, but the sentence doesn't provide enough evidence to support this option.
person | Knowledge: A contraceptive device is a method or tool used by a person to prevent pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer must refer to an individual or group of individuals who use such devices. The options "pharmacy" and "drug store" may sell contraceptive devices, but they do not use them. The option "bedroom" only refers to a location where a person might use a contraceptive device, not who uses it. The option "men" is too specific and excludes individuals who do not identify as male but still use contraceptive devices. Therefore, the only correct and inclusive option is "person".
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Bobby wants to move away from the city to a rural area, which implies a desire for open space, fresh air, and a slower pace of life. Among the given options, only countryside fits this description. The other choices are either specific locations (Illinois, South Dakota, Michigan) or a broader but still regionally specific term (Midwest), and do not convey the same sense of place as countryside.
thermos | Knowledge: The word "stored" in the sentence implies that the liquid needs to be kept for a period of time, and the phrase "not consumed easily" suggests that it needs to be isolated from the immediate environment to prevent spillage or contamination. A thermos is a container that is specifically designed for keeping liquids at a stable temperature for an extended period of time and typically has a secure lid to prevent spillage. The other options may be suitable for short-term storage, but they do not provide the same level of isolation and temperature control as a thermos.
I cannot answer this question without further context or information. Please provide more details or a specific sentence to analyze.
inspires | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam enjoys creating art, which implies that he has a positive attitude towards it. Therefore, it is unlikely that looking at other people's work would depress him or make him feel negative emotions. Instead, it is more likely that looking at other people's art would inspire him to create his own, which is a common experience for artists. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
bed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the puppy is now housebroken and can be trusted to sleep indoors. A bed would be the most appropriate place for the puppy to sleep after being housebroken, as it provides a comfortable and secure space within the home. The other options, such as a dog house or kennel, suggest that the puppy would still need to be kept outside or confined to a specific area, which contradicts the fact that it has been housebroken. The options of a table or home are too vague and do not provide any clear guidance on where the puppy should sleep.
semester | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a periodic assessment given at the end of each quarter. The choices "quarterlight" and "hundredweight" are not terms typically associated with education, making them unlikely options. The choice "hour" does not fit the context of the sentence and is not a common term for a school assessment. While there may be a final exam at the end of the school year, the question specifically uses the term "quarter," indicating a shorter period of time. This leaves "semester" as the most reasonable choice, as many schools divide the school year into two semesters, each with two quarters.
excitement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is beginning work that they really want to do, which is likely to elicit a positive emotion. Excitement is a common emotion associated with starting a new job or project that aligns with one's interests and passions. Stress, confusion, and panic are typically negative emotions that would not likely be felt in this scenario.
pollution | Knowledge: The question is asking about the negative effect that driving a car has. One of the most well-known negative effects of driving a car is that it contributes to pollution, specifically air pollution from exhaust fumes. The other options are either unrelated to the negative effects of driving a car (delays, on time) or are consequences of poor car maintenance rather than driving itself (car crash, run out of gas).
rest area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had been traveling for a long period of time, which is a common reason for people to stop and take a break at a rest area. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. A show or bowling alley would not typically be located near a road or be associated with travel. The mention of a space shuttle or doctor's office seems out of place and does not match the tone or setting described in the sentence.
bedroom | Knowledge: The bedroom is typically where a person keeps their closet and dressers, so it's a natural place for them to get dressed and check their appearance in a mirror. The other options, such as a dressing room or hotel room, may also have mirrors available, but they are less common or not as convenient for everyday use. The toilet and house are too general and do not specifically refer to a place where one would typically get dressed or check their appearance.
maine | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the gardener's rosebush was well-known and distributed in many places, including up north. Maine is the only option that is located in the northern region of America, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
read text | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to find out the arrival time of the bus, and the most logical thing to do in this situation is to consult the station schedule. Therefore, the correct answer is to "read text." The other options do not make sense in this context. "Cross street" and "throw away" are irrelevant and would not help the person find the arrival time. "Enjoy learning" and "play dumb" are also unlikely to be relevant, as the situation described appears to be one where the person is simply trying to find information quickly and efficiently.
arm themselves | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the question is about the actions that precede a bank robbery. It is common for criminals to prepare themselves beforehand by arming themselves, increasing their chances of success and reducing the risk of getting caught. "Step lightly" and "manual" do not make sense in this context, and "serving time" suggests that the criminals have already been caught and convicted, which is not relevant to the question at hand. "Take money" is a possible option, but it is too vague and does not specifically address the preparation aspect of the question.
coming home | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the question is about a sailor's feelings towards a particular destination. "Coming home" is a common phrase used to describe returning to one's place of origin, and a sailor who has been away at sea for a long time would likely be excited to return to their home and loved ones. The other options do not make sense in the context of a sailor's emotions towards a particular destination.
all of the above | Knowledge: The question is open-ended and does not provide any context or limitations. Therefore, any of the choices could be correct as they are all activities that can be done while listening to music. Fiddling, singing, and playing piano are all musical activities that could be done alongside listening to music, while running and having fun are unrelated activities that could also be done while listening to music.
oven | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the turkey needs to be cooked, which means it needs to be heated to a certain temperature. The most common tool to use for cooking is an oven, which uses dry heat to cook food. The other options do not make sense in the context of cooking a turkey. The sink and fridge are used for storage and cleaning, while "bought at store" is not a tool or solution for cooking.
continent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the country being referred to is large and spans a landmass, which is a characteristic commonly associated with continents. Continents are the largest land masses on Earth, and they are typically made up of multiple countries. The other options are not as closely related to the context of the sentence.
persuaded | Knowledge: The question suggests that gaining someone's trust involves persuading them to do what you want. This implies that persuasion is an essential component of trust-building. Communication may be necessary for persuasion, but it alone does not guarantee trust. Learning and engagement may contribute to trust, but they are not directly related to persuading someone to do what you want. Friendship may improve trust, but it does not necessarily involve persuasion.
diss | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the track in question was negative towards the rapper, and the use of slang term "diss" (short for disrespect) reinforces this impression. The other options do not fit with the negative connotation of the sentence. "Belittle" and "contemn" also convey negative attitudes, but they do not specifically relate to a track or musical composition. "Kind" and "being rude" are antonyms and have positive and negative connotations respectively, which do not fit with the context of the sentence.
oil engine | Knowledge: A mechanic typically has expertise in fixing engines, which often require oil to function properly. Squeaky joints and machine parts may also be part of their job, but these issues are less specific to mechanics than oil engines. The other options, such as machine tool and servicing airplanes, are too specialized and do not reflect the general responsibilities of a mechanic.
wedding | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the two friends have decided to get married and therefore, the correct answer is most likely to be wedding. Weddings are typically associated with lifelong commitments and the formal bond of marriage. The options of restaurant, internet cafe, movie, and friend's house are unlikely to be correct as they do not provide a setting conducive to hosting a wedding ceremony.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children do not enjoy going to the opera, as they experience a negative emotion while attending. Boredom is a common feeling associated with attending events that are not engaging or interesting, such as the opera. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
heart attacks | Knowledge: The question implies that excessive jogging can have negative health consequences for elderly people. Heart attacks are a well-known risk associated with strenuous exercise for people of all ages, but particularly for older individuals who may have preexisting heart conditions. The other answer options are also possible side effects of excessive jogging, but they are not specifically related to the context of the question, which concerns the health risks for the elderly.
none of the above | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John does not like new movies and believes they are bad, which implies that he is unlikely to experience any positive emotions such as curiosity, excitement, or wonder when he sees one. Fear and education are also unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is "none of the above."
refrigerator | Knowledge: The other options are all places or situations where ice may be commonly found. A hockey game is played on ice, cold weather may cause ice to form on outdoor surfaces, the polar region of Antarctica is known for its ice formations, and some animals in the zoo may live in environments where ice is present. A refrigerator, on the other hand, is designed to keep things cold but typically does not produce ice unless it has an ice maker or ice tray.
shirt pocket | Knowledge: The question is asking where to put sunglasses if you don't have anything to carry them in. Since the question suggests that the sunglasses need to be easily accessible, options like stores along the beach, eye doctor, or drugstore, that require leaving the sunglasses behind, can be eliminated. A bag might be a good option, but it may not be feasible to carry around all the time. A shirt pocket, on the other hand, is a convenient and easily accessible spot to hold sunglasses.
fight each other | Knowledge: The word "primal" suggests an instinctual behavior, and in the animal kingdom, fighting can be a way to establish dominance and claim territory or resources. While animals may fight for other reasons, such as self-defense or protection of offspring, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on aggression and competition between animals. The other options may also apply to animals, but do not necessarily relate to the idea of proving oneself through physical conflict.
office | Knowledge: The question mentions a workplace, which suggests a location where people are working indoors rather than outside. The options of alley, motel, and park are unlikely to contain a trash can near liquid in a workplace. The option of water cooler could be a possibility, but it is more likely that a trash can would be located near an area where employees generate trash, such as a desk or breakroom. The most logical option is office.
feeling of accomplishment | Knowledge: The sentence implies that creating art gave the speaker a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment, which is commonly associated with achieving a goal or completing a task. A common expression used in this context is "a feeling of accomplishment." The other options may also be associated with creating art, but they do not directly relate to the idea of fulfillment or satisfaction.
trash can or waste bin | Knowledge: The word "rubbish" is often used to refer to waste or trash, so the correct answer is likely to be a place where garbage is disposed of. "Pooja hall" and "park" do not have any relevance to the context of the question, while "television" is not a place where you watch rubbish but a device used to watch TV programs. Therefore, "trash can" or "waste bin" are the most appropriate choices.
selfless | Knowledge: The sentence compares a selfish action (not sharing a sandwich with a hungry friend) to an action that indicates the opposite trait. Therefore, the correct answer must be a word that describes someone who would willingly share their sandwich with a friend in need. Options like philanthropic imply a larger scale of giving, while not hungry is not relevant to the context. Unselfish and altruistic are synonyms for the word selfless, which means putting the needs of others before your own. Therefore, selfless is the most appropriate answer.
take care of proposals | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boss gave the person money to make the clients happy, which would likely involve some kind of business-related task. Taking care of proposals is a common responsibility in many industries and involves creating and submitting proposals to potential clients or stakeholders. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sweating | Knowledge: When the body gets hot during exercise, it produces sweat. Sweat is the body's way of cooling down by releasing heat from the surface of the skin through evaporation. This means that if someone goes jogging or engages in physical activity, they are likely to sweat, which could then cause their shirt to become soaked. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for why someone's shirt would become soaked during exercise.
arctic or antarctica | Knowledge: Insulation is used to keep a space warm, so the correct answer would be a location that is cold. The options "house," "attic," and "loft" are too general and do not specifically reference a cold environment. "Arctic" and "Antarctica" are both locations known for their extremely cold temperatures, so they are the most likely correct answers.
column | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific feature or aspect of the location that the tourist is interested in, which is described as a "column." The other choices (statue, pantheon, roman architecture, whitehouse) may be associated with famous locations, but they do not match the specific detail mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, the sentence highlights that the location is famous for its color, which may suggest that it is a visually striking place, further supporting the idea that the tourist is interested in a particular visual feature (i.e. the column).
wear hats | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are doing something specific in response to the cold weather. Wearing hats is a common practice during cold weather because it helps to retain body heat and prevent heat loss through the head. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Completing a job or killing animals may not be affected by the weather, wearing shorts would be an unexpected activity during cold weather, and believing in God is a personal belief that is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
lose money | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the business did not make a profit, indicating that it experienced a financial loss. The term "lose money" is commonly used to describe a situation where a business or individual experiences a decrease in their financial resources, and is therefore the most appropriate choice. The other options do not accurately describe a situation where a business did not make a profit.
arm | Knowledge: The word "humorous" refers to the upper arm bone. This bone is a major part of the skeletal system and is found in the arm of mammals, including cows and humans. The other options, such as fresh fish, museum, and comedy club, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
school | Knowledge: Tote bags are commonly used to carry papers and other items for school or work. The other options, such as shopping cart or garage, do not make sense in the context of carrying papers. The closet is a possible option, but it would depend on the situation and what the papers were needed for.
school | Knowledge: A supply closet is a place where materials and equipment are stored, typically in a workplace or school setting. It is unlikely to be located in a bedroom or a coat closet, as those are typically used for personal belongings. A mop and bucket closet would be a more specific term for a supply closet in a cleaning area. "House" is too general and does not specify a specific room or location.
French door  | Knowledge: The use of the word "swinging hinge" suggests that the object being installed is a door. Of the given options, a French door is the most common type of door that is made up of two parts that swing open. A swing door typically only has one part that swings, while a gate is typically used for outdoor entrances and may not be designed with a swinging hinge. Car doors and exterior doors also do not fit the context of the sentence.
causing pain | Knowledge: The sentence implies that one person is intentionally causing harm to another person. "Causing pain" is the most direct and accurate answer that fits the context of the sentence. "Seeking revenge" may imply that the person being hurt had previously harmed the other person, which is not mentioned in the sentence. "Hurt feelings" and "sadness" are emotions that may be experienced as a result of being hurt, but do not directly answer the question of what the person is doing. "Relieve" is the opposite of causing pain and does not fit the context of the sentence.
perspiration | Knowledge: Fencing is a physically demanding sport that requires a lot of physical exertion. When the weather is really hot, it can cause the body to sweat excessively, which can lead to a higher chance of slipping or losing grip on the fencing weapon. Perspiration, therefore, is a potential problem when fencing in hot weather. Puncture wound, drinking, severe injuries, and competition are not related to the context of the question.
might understand | Knowledge: The word "cogitate" means to think deeply or carefully about something. If you spend a lot of time cogitating on a topic, you are likely to come to a deeper understanding of it. The other options do not necessarily follow from the meaning of the word "cogitate."
ecosphere | Knowledge: The use of the word "ecosphere" suggests that John was planting trees as part of a larger effort to support the environment. Ficus trees are commonly used in reforestation projects, which aim to restore ecosystems that have been damaged or destroyed by human activity. The other options, such as "sunny window" or "pots", do not have any clear connection to the idea of environmental restoration.
England | Knowledge: Red phone booths are a well-known symbol of England, so this choice is likely the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The phrase "living less expensively" also does not seem relevant to the question.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a location that is well-known for having numerous lakes. Michigan is a state in the United States with a nickname of "The Great Lakes State" because it is surrounded by the Great Lakes, which are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The other options do not necessarily have a significant association with lakes.
warehouse | Knowledge: The amount of storage needed, 500 tons, suggests that James requires a large space to accommodate these items. A warehouse would be the most suitable option as it is specifically designed for storing large amounts of goods. The other options, such as an attic or garage, would be too small to store such a large quantity of items, while Michigan does not provide any insight into the type of facility needed.
movies | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is one where people frequently eat popcorn and drink soda while seated. This is a common practice in movie theaters, where concession stands offer these snacks to movie-goers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get dressed | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is just waking up and heading to work. In order to go to work, they would need to get dressed first. The other options are not applicable or necessary for heading to work, such as concentrating or having a job. Drinking coffee may be a personal preference, but it is not necessary for going to work.
park forest | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in parklands and mountainous areas, which are often characterized by dense forests and rocky terrain. Vancouver Island is a location where marmots can be found, but it is not a type of habitat. The terms "jungle" and "North America" are not relevant to the habitat of marmots, as they are not typically found in dense tropical forests or across the entire North American continent. The option "northern hemisphere" is too broad, as marmots are only located in specific regions of the hemisphere.
war | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while terrorism may be caused by a few individuals, it can have far-reaching consequences. The use of the phrase "all out" implies that the consequences are significant and widespread, beyond just the immediate effects of terrorism such as detonating bombs. Of the options given, war is the most logical choice as it involves large-scale conflicts and is often a result of terrorism that is not effectively addressed or resolved. The other options do not fully capture the breadth and severity of the consequences suggested by the sentence.
case | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wristwatch is valuable and needs to be stored safely. The options "jewelry box", "dresser" and "hock" do not provide enough protection for an expensive wristwatch. "Jewelry store" is not a likely option for someone to keep their own wristwatch, as it is typically a retail store. "Case" is the most appropriate choice, as it is a secure and protective storage option for a valuable item like a wristwatch.
asia minor | Knowledge: In this question, the phrase "main part of turkey" refers to a geographical location, which narrows down the possible answers to the ones that refer to geography rather than animals or bodies of water. The term "middle east" could be a possible answer, as Turkey is located in the region commonly referred to as the Middle East, but the more specific and accurate answer is "asia minor." Asia Minor is the peninsula on which Turkey is situated, and it is a commonly used term to describe this region. The Balkan Peninsula is not related to Turkey, and "turkeycock" is a non-existent word that does not make any sense in the context of the question.
warmth | Knowledge: The question asks what someone might be starting a fire to achieve, indicating that the person has a purpose for starting the fire. The option "warmth" is the most logical choice as starting a fire can provide warmth and is a common reason for starting fires in camping, outdoor activities or even in homes during the winter season. The options "burns", "going to jail", and "haircut" do not have a clear connection to starting a fire. Also, "going to jail" is repeated in the options which indicates that it is most likely not the correct answer.
recession | Knowledge: Central banks typically use monetary policy tools, such as raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, to combat inflation. One common consequence of such policies is a slowdown in economic activity, known as a recession. Stealing and spending more are not methods used by central banks, and deflation and problems are potential consequences or symptoms of inflation, rather than methods to combat it.
stop breathing | Knowledge: When living beings die, their breathing usually stops first. This happens because breathing is controlled by the respiratory system, which depends on the heart to pump oxygen-rich blood to the lungs. When the heart stops beating, there is no more oxygen to fuel the respiratory system, and breathing stops. The other options are not necessarily true for all cases of dying, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
animal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Samantha prefers to spend her time with something other than people, and the option "animal" is the only choice that is not related to people. The other options ("headache," "many people," "put together," and "own house") all relate to people, objects, or concepts that are directly or indirectly associated with people. Additionally, the notion that Samantha is uncomfortable around others further supports the idea that she would prefer the company of something other than people, like an animal.
office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man needs to complete paperwork, which is typically done in an office setting. The other options do not necessarily provide a suitable location for completing work-related tasks, such as paperwork. "Desk" may be too specific, "work" is too general, "downtown" is unrelated to the task at hand, and "meeting" suggests a different purpose than completing paperwork.
ireland | Knowledge: Pubs are a type of establishment known for serving alcoholic beverages and providing a social gathering place. Ireland is well-known for its pub culture, with traditional pubs being an important part of Irish society and often serving as community centers. Great Britain and England may also have pubs, but they are not as strongly associated with this type of establishment as Ireland is. Bahrain and London do not have a particular connection to pubs.
Virginia | Knowledge: The question mentions "blue ridge mountains" and specifically says they are called "Blue Mountain." Virginia is home to the Blue Ridge Mountains, and there is a peak called "Blue Mountain" located in Virginia as well. The other options do not have a clear connection to the Blue Ridge Mountains or the name "Blue Mountain."
state park | Knowledge: Fishing is an activity usually done in outdoor bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. State parks often have bodies of water that are stocked with fish and open for fishing to visitors. Confession, concert, carnival, and apartment have no clear association with fishing or outdoor activities.
monarchy | Knowledge: The question is asking about the class or group of people that a king or queen belongs to. Monarchy refers to a form of government in which a country is ruled by a single person, usually a king or queen, who holds absolute power over the people. This means that the monarch is considered to be above the rest of society, and belongs to a distinct social class. The other options have no connection to the concept of monarchy.
absolution | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sinner is seeking forgiveness from a deity, which can be achieved through a process called absolution. Absolution is the act of being pardoned or forgiven for one's sins, usually through a religious rite or sacrament. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
indoor plumbing | Knowledge: The term "outhouse" typically refers to an outdoor toilet, which was a common feature in older homes or in areas without access to modern plumbing systems. Therefore, the opposite of not having an outhouse would be having indoor plumbing, which is a more modern and convenient method of disposing of waste. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sigh | Knowledge: The sentence states that the breathing makes noise but does not indicate that the person is sick. A sigh is a deep and audible exhale often used to indicate tiredness, disappointment, or relief, but it is not a symptom of illness. The other options, such as coughing or clavicular breathing (breathing with the upper chest only), are associated with respiratory problems or health issues, making them incorrect choices. Yawning is a normal reflex that can be noisy, but it is not associated with sickness or health problems. "Live" is not a type of breathing.
skill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people enjoy competing because it allows them to showcase their abilities or talents in some area. This is closely related to the concept of skill, which is a measure of a person's proficiency or competence in a certain activity. The other options do not seem as relevant to the context of the sentence, as sportsmanship, opponent, and effort are more about the behavior or attitudes associated with competition, while competition itself is a broader concept that encompasses many types of activities.
excited | Knowledge: The sentence implies that visiting museums of old dinosaur bones has a positive impact on children. The word "amazement" suggests that the children are in awe of the exhibits and find them interesting, while the phrase "being bored" suggests the opposite. The word "crowding" does not make sense in this context, and "retrospection" is not related to the theme of the sentence. Therefore, the best answer is "excited".
customer | Knowledge: The comparison to a shark implies that the salesperson is actively seeking out potential customers to sell to, much like a shark searches for prey. The other options, such as a bookstore or toy store, may have customers, but they are not specific to the context of the sentence as the term "prey" suggests a hunting or aggressive behavior towards customers.
suit | Knowledge: The term "gentleman" is often associated with professionalism, formality, and class, which makes "suit" a likely choice as a gentleman's attire. A suit is a commonly accepted formal outfit that suggests sophistication and maturity, which are key attributes commonly associated with a gentleman. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
garage | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location being referred to is typically used for storage of tools, which is often associated with a garage. A repair shop may also be a possible location for tools, but this would be a more specialized setting, and there is no contextual reference to suggest that this is the case. A drawer is too small a space and the neighbor's house and dentist have no connection to the idea of storing tools.
Oklahoma | Knowledge: The mention of the Big Twelve conference suggests a connection to college athletics. The only option among the choices that is a state is Oklahoma, which is home to the University of Oklahoma, whose athletic teams are known as the Sooners and play in the Big Twelve conference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
meditate | Knowledge: The sentence states that after the yoga class, everyone was instructed to sit quietly. Meditation is a common practice in yoga and is often done as a way to relax and calm the mind. Therefore, it makes sense that the correct answer is "meditate." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "sit down" and "alone" are too vague, "shut up" is inappropriate and rude, and "go home" does not indicate any further instructions or actions.
show emotion | Knowledge: The phrase "kept a straight face" implies that the person did not display any emotions on their face. This suggests that they were purposely avoiding showing any emotion. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
montana | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the ranch house is a common type of architecture in a particular state located in the northwestern Rocky Mountains. Montana is a state known for its vast expanses of open land, cattle ranches, and rural communities, making it a likely candidate for the answer. British Columbia is a province in Canada and is not located in the United States. California is located on the West Coast but does not fall within the northwestern Rocky Mountains. The term "desert" does not provide enough context to make an informed choice.
exchanging information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boss disapproves of the employees chatting with their friends during work hours. However, the boss seems to be okay with the employees doing something else. The phrase "exchanging information" suggests that the boss is okay with the employees discussing work-related topics or exchanging information that would help them in their jobs. The other options, such as happiness, laughter, communication, and social approval, do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gain knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student attended a lecture after pulling an all-nighter. The most likely reason for the student to pull an all-nighter would be to study, prepare for the lecture, and gain knowledge beforehand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
string quintet | Knowledge: The question is asking for a musical ensemble that includes four instruments, one of which is a viola. A string quartet only includes two violins, a viola, and a cello, so it does not match the question's requirements. A symphony and an orchestra both include many different instruments, so it is impossible to know whether a viola will be present or not. A viola case is not a musical ensemble. A string quintet, on the other hand, includes two violins, a viola, a cello, and an additional instrument, which could be another viola or a double bass. Therefore, a string quintet is the correct answer.
hardware store | Knowledge: The other options do not make sense in the context of obtaining a ladder. An apple orchard and backyard would not have ladders readily available for purchase or loan. A garage may have a ladder, but it's not a given, and it's not a place to go to specifically obtain a ladder. A roof is a dangerous place to climb without proper equipment and training, and it's not a place to go to obtain a ladder. A hardware store, on the other hand, is a common place to purchase or rent ladders for home projects.
public place | Knowledge: The use of the word "likely" implies that there is a common or expected behavior. While it's possible to see someone pushing a religious tract in any of the listed locations, the most common place would be in a public place such as a park or busy street corner where there are a lot of people. Pushing religious tracts in places like airports or churches may be seen as more targeted or intentional, while pushing them in a laundromat or on a stage may not be as effective in reaching a large audience.
dining room | Knowledge: A sideboard is a piece of furniture that is commonly used to store and display serving dishes, particularly in dining rooms. The other options, such as kitchen or bathroom, are unlikely places where one would find a sideboard filled with serving dishes. The context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on a specific area of the home where meals are served, which points to the dining room as the most likely answer.
failure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that studying for final exams is a stressful experience, and specifically mentions being afraid of something. The context implies that the fear is related to the outcome of the exams, which suggests that the correct answer is failure. This is further supported by the fact that success and graduation are presented as positive outcomes, which would not cause fear. Anxiety and studying are not outcomes but rather aspects of the studying experience itself, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
mexico | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a steakhouse can be found with an ocean view. Mexico has many coastal cities and is known for its steak and seafood. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
stop talking | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for something parents commonly tell their kids in order to get them to go to sleep. The phrase "stop talking" is often used in this context, as chatty children may stay up later than they should if they are allowed to continue talking. The other options, while related to sleeping or bedtime, do not specifically address the issue of talking which is commonly associated with bedtime.
attack | Knowledge: The word "protect" suggests that the guard is there to prevent harm or danger. The options "unprotected" and "getting lost" do not imply a specific threat to be protected from. The options "inmate" and "prisoner" suggest that the guard is already in a place where dangerous individuals are being held, but does not necessarily indicate that the guard is protecting the person being asked. The option "attack" is the most likely answer, as it suggests that the guard is there to prevent physical harm from occurring.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person needs to purchase more beer, which suggests that they would need to go to a store to buy it. The options "casino," "fridge," and "refrigerator" are not plausible choices for purchasing beer, as they are not typically associated with selling alcohol. "Bottle" is a vague option, as it is not clear where the bottle would be purchased from. "Grocery store" is the most reasonable choice, as beer is commonly sold in grocery stores.
earn money | Knowledge: The phrase "returns to work" implies that the person was not previously working, and the choice "earn money" makes the most sense as a reason for them to return to work. The other options ("key", "get out of bed", "need money", "understand themselves") are either irrelevant or not directly related to the context of the sentence.
better grade | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a positive outcome associated with answering questions correctly. One common outcome of answering questions correctly is an improvement in one's grade or overall academic performance. The other options, such as embarrassment or failure, are negative outcomes that are not typically associated with successfully answering questions in an academic setting. Additionally, the option "children will learn" is not a specific outcome related to the individual answering the questions, but rather a goal or result more broadly associated with the process of education. Finally, "discussion" may be a positive outcome of answering questions, but it does not directly address the question of what answering questions correctly leads to.
live many years | Knowledge: The sentence is comparing the lifespan of indoor cats versus outdoor cats. It is a known fact that outdoor cats have a shorter lifespan than indoor cats due to various factors such as exposure to danger and diseases. The phrase "tend to" suggests that this is a general trend rather than an absolute fact. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rapport | Knowledge: The sentence implies that despite the couple's regular sexual activity, they lack a sense of familiarity or connection with each other. "Rapport" refers to the ability to communicate and connect with someone, indicating that the couple's lack of rapport may be contributing to their superficial relationship. The other options do not appear to be relevant to the sentence's context.
bar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is drinking alcohol in public and getting drunk, which is a common activity at bars. Bars are establishments where people go to consume alcoholic beverages, whereas the other options (jail, gutter, city hall, park) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathing suit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the grain of sand is causing discomfort to the person wearing something. A grain of sand getting into a bucket, sand pile, or beach wouldn't have a noticeable impact. A clam may cause discomfort if it bites someone, but this isn't mentioned in the sentence. The only logical option is a bathing suit, as a grain of sand getting into a bathing suit may cause irritation or itching.
heavens | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people in ancient times were interested in charting each star, which implies a fascination with the nighttime sky. The other options do not have any obvious relevance to the context of the sentence. Staring into the heavens or sky is a common expression for looking up at the stars or celestial bodies, which reinforces the idea that the correct answer is "heavens."
eastern united states | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person traveled to a destination known as the "big apple" which is commonly used to refer to New York City. The fact that they hit a "toll road or two" suggests that they were driving on highways, which further narrows down the location to the eastern United States where toll roads are common. The other options, such as France or Massachusetts, are not specific enough to match the context of the sentence.
black market | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John is unable to find any legal alternatives for the item he's searching for, and his inability to travel out of the country exacerbates the illegal nature of the item he's seeking. This suggests that John will have to obtain the item through illegal means, which is often associated with the black market. The other options, such as rules or underage, do not offer a viable solution for obtaining the item. The white market refers to legal transactions, while banned simply refers to the fact that the item is prohibited.
ask for help | Knowledge: The question implies that the person praying is experiencing troubles and needs help. Out of the options given, asking for help is the most appropriate action to take when in need. Talking to God and looking upward are both common actions during prayer, but they do not necessarily address the person's specific troubles. Clapping and kneeling down may be personal preferences but are not essential for effective prayer.
freezer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has just bought some food and needs cold storage for it. The most common type of cold storage for personal use is a household freezer, which is designed to keep food frozen for extended periods of time. The other options, such as a laboratory or restaurant, do not make sense in the context of storing food bought for personal use. The grocery store is also not a viable option as the person has already bought the food and needs to store it at home.
say thank | Knowledge: The correct answer should be a verb that suggests expressing gratitude or appreciation for someone's help. "Say thank" is the only option that fits this description, while the other options do not convey a clear message of thanking someone. "Satisfaction" and "smile at" are not actions that show appreciation, while "will thank" and "say compliment" are uncertain and unclear in their meaning.
desk drawer | Knowledge: Glue is a commonly used item in offices, homes, and schools, and is often stored in a container that is easily accessible when needed. A desk drawer is a logical place to store glue in an office or classroom setting, and is likely the most common option among the choices given. A closed container or barrel would not be practical for accessing glue quickly, while "school" and "classroom" are not specific enough and could refer to a variety of locations within those settings.
garden shed | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the hose is likely stored in a place where gardening tools and equipment are kept. A balcony, greenhouse, and garage are not typically used for storing gardening supplies, and a hardware store is a place to purchase items rather than store them. Therefore, the most likely answer is the garden shed.
run amok | Knowledge: The word "panic" suggests a situation where people are experiencing intense fear or anxiety. When people panic, they often act without thinking and may behave in unpredictable and violent ways. "Run amok" means to behave uncontrollably and violently, which is a common reaction in a panicked crowd. The other options do not accurately reflect the behavior of people in a state of panic.
dead | Knowledge: The question is asking about the end result of someone committing a murder. Murder is the act of intentionally killing another person, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the victim will be dead. The other options may describe the process or effects of the murder, but they do not accurately answer the question of what happens to the victim.
use soap | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that water alone was not sufficient for the man to clean his clothes. This implies he needed another substance to help him get the dirt out. Soap is a common cleaning agent that is often used along with water to wash clothes. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence (gather up, get dirty, washcloth) or are already mentioned in the sentence (use water).
plate | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the potatoes are going to be served, so the correct answer would be a vessel that is commonly used for serving food. Among the options provided, "plate" is the most appropriate vessel for serving potatoes. "Fried" and "French fries" are methods of preparing the potatoes, while "countryside" and "restaurant" are not vessels.
discovering truth | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sean enjoys analyzing information, which suggests that he is interested in uncovering or discovering some underlying truth or meaning. The other options, such as "enlightened" or "learn more about," do not necessarily imply a search for truth or meaning, but could represent a more general interest in acquiring knowledge or expanding one's understanding. The word "facts" is also not specific enough to capture the idea of discovering truth, as facts can be objective and neutral without necessarily revealing a deeper truth.
furniture store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a presentation may be set up on a table, which implies that it may be related to showcasing physical items. A furniture store typically displays furniture on tables or in showrooms, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not offer as clear a connection to the context of the sentence.
Unknown without further context.
school | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the students needed new sports equipment, which implies that they are involved in some sort of athletic activity. The logical place for them to use this equipment would be at their school. The other options, such as the mall or Sears, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
trip | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person fell while going for a run, which typically happens when a person trips or loses their balance. Sweating, satisfaction, working out, and better health are not directly related to falling while running.
strain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that reading letters produces something negative when someone is unaware of a condition. The word "strain" implies that reading may be difficult or uncomfortable. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. Laughter, realization, enlightenment, and happiness are all positive experiences that would not typically result from difficulty reading.
get passport | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is going overseas, which typically requires a passport. Shouting at, feeling happy, or crossing the street do not have any clear connection to overseas travel. Boarding a ship might be a possible action if the person is traveling by sea, but getting a passport is a necessary step regardless of the mode of transportation.
increasing knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person enjoys being able to answer anything, which implies that they enjoy learning and acquiring knowledge. The phrase "loved studying" further reinforces this idea that the person is interested in gaining more knowledge. The options "better grades," "higher intelligence," "inspiration," and "strain eyes" do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide any logical connection to the idea of being a trivia hound who loves learning.
universal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people from all countries enjoyed the music, indicating that the music had a wide appeal and could be enjoyed by people from different cultural backgrounds. The word "universal" describes something that is applicable or relatable to everyone, regardless of their background, and would therefore be the most appropriate choice. The other options describe specific qualities of the music, but do not necessarily indicate that the music was universally enjoyed.
reduce | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John tried to gain money, but his attempts to improve himself only had a negative effect on his income. This suggests that John's income decreased or was reduced as a result of his efforts. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence (e.g. "lose weight" is irrelevant to the topic of money and income).
Texas, Southern California | Knowledge: Mexican cuisine is often associated with regions like Texas and Southern California due to their proximity to Mexico and large Hispanic populations. Texas, in particular, is known for its Tex-Mex cuisine, which blends elements of Mexican and American cuisine. San Diego is also known for its Mexican food, but it is a more localized answer compared to the broader regions of Texas and Southern California. Mexico and Mexica are incorrect answers as they are not US states.
rest area | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a location where pillows are not typically found. Home and bedroom are locations where pillows are common, and "make seat softer" and "go to bed" are not locations. Rest area is a location where pillows are not usually provided, making it the correct answer.
disaster | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the fire has caused significant damage and has continued for at least a week, leading the governor to declare it as the "biggest" he had seen. The word "disaster" fits the context as it suggests a widespread and severe event, which is likely to be the case with a wildfire raging for two weeks. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity of the situation.
England | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the tourists are seeking out a specific cultural icon that is commonly associated with England - the red telephone box. London is the capital of England, so it may seem like a viable option, but it is too specific and not necessarily relevant to the idea of seeking out red telephone boxes in general. The other options, such as calling mom or going to a restaurant or bank, have no connection to the idea of seeking out a specific cultural icon.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The instruction to keep the gel container cool suggests that it needs to be stored in a temperature-controlled environment. The most common temperature-controlled place in most households is a refrigerator, which is designed to keep food and other items at a cool temperature to prevent spoilage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and none of them are designed to keep things cool.
roast | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that James used the oven to cook the meat, which implies that he was using a dry heat method. Roasting is a dry heat cooking method that typically involves cooking meat in an oven, and is often used for larger cuts of meat like roasts. Burning would result in an overcooked or even charred meat, while baking would typically involve using a batter or dough. The options of ocean and cool temperature are not applicable to cooking meat in an oven.
social capabilities | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that to be able to chat with friends, someone needs to have the ability to interact socially with others. This could include skills such as being able to initiate and maintain conversations, read social cues, and adapt to the social context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
graduate from high school  | Knowledge: Tertiary education typically refers to college or university education, which is pursued after completing high school. Therefore, the logical answer would be to "graduate from high school" before entering tertiary education. The other options (catch cold, feel lonely, enter college, finish junior high) are irrelevant to the context of the question.
dress himself or herself, and/or drink beer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a party involves socializing or enjoyment, so dressing oneself and drinking beer are more appropriate activities than driving a train or grumbling. The choice of dressing oneself depends on whether the person in question is a male or female.
food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going to the market on a weekend has something to do with obtaining a certain type of item or experience that can be counted on. The option "food" is the most likely correct answer, as markets are often associated with purchasing fresh fruits, vegetables, and other types of food items. The other options are less likely to be correct, as they either do not fit with the context of the sentence or are too general to be a specific reference to what can be counted on when going to the market on a weekend (e.g. "see other people").
careful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individuals are making an important decision and want to ensure that they have all the information they need to make a informed choice. The option "careful" is the most logical choice, as it implies a thoughtful and cautious approach. The other options, such as "save money" and "make money," do not necessarily relate to the decision-making process and may not align with the individuals' goals. "Down payment" is a specific term related to financial transactions, but it does not encompass the broader context of the sentence. "Rush" also does not make sense in this context, as it implies the individuals are in a hurry to make a decision.
restaurant | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person wants to go to a place where they will be treated with respect and possibly even like royalty. While some of the other options may offer a level of respect or formality, a restaurant is most commonly associated with providing a high level of service and hospitality to its customers, including treating them with courtesy and respect. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
utah | Knowledge: Lizards are reptiles commonly found in dry, hot climates such as deserts. Utah is known for having a desert climate, which makes it a likely location to find lizards in the wild. The other options, such as a garden or the zoo, are not necessarily places where lizards would be found naturally. South Carolina and Bermuda also do not have a climate or environment that is particularly known for the presence of lizards in the wild.
headaches | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that attempting too much learning can have negative consequences, and specifically mentions headaches as a potential outcome. While education, growth, and knowing more may be positive outcomes of learning, they are not mentioned as potential negative consequences in this sentence. Intelligence is also not necessarily related to attempting too much learning, as intelligence is a complex trait that cannot be solely attributed to the amount of learning one has done.
sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone were to lay on the floor of their outdoor deck and look up, they would be looking at something above them. The only option that fits this description is the sky, which is commonly visible above outdoor decks. The other options, such as understanding themselves or looking at a wall or carpet, do not make sense in this context.
comfort | Knowledge: The use of the word "cushy" in the sentence suggests that sitting in the chair will be comfortable. Additionally, the other options are not necessarily associated with sitting in a chair, such as falling asleep or flatulence. "Laziness" may be a possibility but is not directly related to sitting in a chair.
foundation | Knowledge: The word "require" suggests that this is a necessary component in the construction of houses. A foundation is a crucial component of any building, as it provides stability and support. The other options do not make sense in this context - "very large" and "pornography" are not relevant to the construction of houses, "walls" are built on the foundation, not the other way around, and "hole" is too vague and does not suggest any kind of construction.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where one can control their own electricity. This is commonly found in homes and buildings, which typically have a basement where the electrical panel or master control is located. The other options do not make sense in this context; a big factory, helm of ship, or main office would likely have a more complex electrical system that would require a different type of control, while "center" is too vague without additional information.
kill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the senator was making excuses for someone's potentially violent behavior and trying to blame media (video games and television) for it. The correct answer must be a word that completes the sentence in a logical and appropriate way, given the context. "Kill" is the only option that makes sense in this context – the senator is trying to excuse violence, which is often associated with killing, and is suggesting that media cannot make someone violent enough to kill. The other options (such as "plug in" or "switch on") do not fit the context or make sense logically in this sentence.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the frozen food is starting to melt, which suggests that it needs to be kept at a lower temperature to prevent spoilage. The most likely option is the refrigerator or fridge, which is designed to keep food at a cool temperature. The other options, such as a supermarket or grocery store, do not provide sufficient cooling to prevent the food from spoiling. Additionally, a heater would only make the problem worse, as it would cause the food to melt even faster.
garage | Knowledge: A drill is a commonly used tool for DIY projects and repairs, and is often stored in a place that is easily accessible. While it's possible for some people to store their drill in a basement or repair shop, these locations are less likely as they are not as convenient as a garage which is often located near the entrance of the house or apartment. Additionally, storing a drill in a bathroom or dentist office does not make sense as these places are not typically associated with home improvement or repairs.
competitiveness | Knowledge: The question is asking about winning a game, which implies a competitive situation where there are winners and losers. Therefore, competitiveness is the most appropriate choice. Satisfaction and learning may be outcomes of playing a game, but they do not guarantee winning. Injuries are a possible risk of playing a game, but not a necessary requirement for winning. Play is a generic term that does not provide any specific information about winning a game.
asia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the gazelle can be found in a zoo that is reminiscent of Disneyland. Since the question also specifies that the location is in an eastern continent, we can eliminate Australia and Ivory Coast as potential options. Wildlife refuge and open plain are not specific enough locations to suggest where this Disneyland-like zoo may be located. This leaves us with Asia as the correct answer, as it is a large continent known for its diverse range of animal habitats and also home to popular theme parks such as Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.
stable | Knowledge: A stable is a common place for domesticated animals such as cows to live, as it provides shelter and a safe space for them. The other options, such as a zoo, story book, or toy store are not realistic or practical places for a cow to live. The great outdoors may be an option for some cows, but generally, they require a certain level of care and protection that they would not receive in the wild.
acting out | Knowledge: The word "spiteful" suggests that the child did something negative, possibly in retaliation or with a desire to cause harm. The phrase "acting out" is often used to describe behavior that is disruptive, defiant, or attention-seeking, which would fit with this context. The other options do not involve negative behavior, nor do they directly relate to the idea of being spiteful towards parents.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being in a hot weather can cause discomfort, and going into an air conditioned room can provide some form of relief from the heat. Out of the given choices, only relief makes sense in the context of finding a solution to the discomfort caused by hot weather. The other options either do not relate to the situation or are not effective ways of finding relief from hot weather.
open plain | Knowledge: Gazelles are known to inhabit open grassy plains and savannas, so the correct answer would be "open plain." "Encyclopedia" and "breakfast" are unrelated to the context of the question, while "Ivory Coast" is a specific area in Africa that may or may not have gazelles. "Asia" is a large continent and it is unclear if gazelles inhabit any areas within it.
pain | Knowledge: The use of "did not want to know" suggests that the truth discovered is likely to be unpleasant or difficult to accept. This could lead to emotional pain, such as feeling betrayed or hurt. The other options, such as relief or understanding, do not align with the negative connotations of the question. Grey hair and enlightenment are not necessarily related to the emotional consequences of discovering an unwanted truth.
school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the principal was giving a speech, which is commonly associated with school settings. The other options do not make sense in the context of a principal giving a speech, such as a sporting event or concert hall.
feathers | Knowledge: The sentence describes a bird flying and then landing on a branch, which suggests that the answer is related to some characteristic of the bird's anatomy. The options "having for pet" and "falling down" are not related to the sentence and can be eliminated. The sentence mentions that the bird flew, which indicates that the bird has wings. Therefore, the correct answer must be "feathers," which are a distinctive feature of birds that facilitate flight. Finally, the option "two legs" is not relevant because the bird's legs are not mentioned in the sentence.
state park | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a recreation area run by the local government, which suggests a public park or similar space. The term "state park" specifically refers to a protected area of land managed by a government entity, often for recreational use. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fall | Knowledge: Summer is followed by the season of fall, so it is the correct answer. "Stand", "nice", and "cold" have no clear relationship to the question. While "winter" does come after fall, it is not the immediate next season in the sequence.
stapler | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the task at hand involves attaching two pieces of paper together. The options "pantry," "office," and "desk drawer" are not relevant to the task and do not provide a solution. "Stick" may refer to a glue stick, which the sentence indicates the speaker does not want to use. A stapler is a common tool for attaching paper together without the use of glue.
having children | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that women have a specific goal or desire related to their reproductive capabilities. "Having children" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly addresses the topic of procreation. "Population increase" is too general and doesn't take into account the personal motivations of individual women. "Pregnancy" is related to the process of having children but doesn't necessarily imply an expectation or goal. "Feeling good" and "train" are completely unrelated and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
consume the cookies | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the parent has baked some cookies, which would typically be consumed or eaten after they are baked. The other options do not make sense in this context - there is no indication that the parent is experiencing fear or homeschooling, and the options to box gift for the child or close the box aren't relevant as it is not mentioned that a box is present or what it contains.
continent | Knowledge: Australia is commonly referred to as both a country and a continent. It is the only country that is also considered a continent due to its size and distinct landmass. The other options do not accurately describe Australia.
murder | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is intentionally killing others, which is commonly referred to as murder. The other options are not accurate descriptions of a person who commits murder. "Terrible" is too vague and could apply to a wide range of behaviors, "going to jail" and "get arrested" are consequences of the behavior rather than descriptions of the person, and "hunter" is a completely different activity that involves killing animals rather than people.
trip over | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the runner's bad shoelaces caused him to lose the race, which implies that they may have caused him to stumble or trip. This makes "trip over" the most likely answer. The other options (e.g. gain ground, win the race) are unlikely given that the sentence clearly states that the runner lost, and it is not clear how bad shoelaces would help the runner near the finish line. The option "get tired" is also unlikely, as the sentence does not suggest that the runner was physically exhausted, but rather that his shoelaces were the issue.
concert hall | Knowledge: A platform is often used in a concert hall for a performer to stand on while playing an instrument, such as a violin. A train, museum, arena, or building would not typically have a platform designated for a violinist to perform on.
Any of the choices could be correct. | Knowledge: Art galleries can be found in a variety of locations, including cities both large and small, downtown areas, and the middle of town. While cities like London and Frankfurt may be well-known for their art scenes and have a higher concentration of galleries, it is still possible to find galleries in other locations as well. Ultimately, the correct answer will depend on the context of the question and any additional information provided.
take time | Knowledge: The sentence implies that whatever you do, it requires effort and something else. "Make progress" and "make peace" do not necessarily require effort, whereas "make war" has a negative connotation that doesn't fit the context. "Kindness" is not connected to the idea of making an effort. "Take time" fits well as an option since many things in life require both effort and time to accomplish, such as learning a new skill or completing a project.
home depot | Knowledge: The phrase "head out to shop" suggests that the person is going to a store to purchase something. The options "loft," "house," and "kitchen" are not stores, so they cannot be the correct answer. The option "bundle" does not make sense in the context of remodeling or shopping for flooring. "Home Depot" is a well-known home improvement store that commonly sells flooring and other remodeling supplies, making it the most likely option.
attic | Knowledge: The description of Billy stumbling about in a dark place and a rolled up map of stars suggest that he is likely in an attic, where people often store items that are not used frequently, such as the map of stars. The creaky floor also points to the possibility of being in an attic, as the wood is often old and may make noise when someone walks on it. The other options are not related to the context and do not make sense with the description provided.
sunshine | Knowledge: Lemurs are diurnal animals, meaning they are active during the day and asleep at night. Therefore, it is likely that they rely on sunshine to see, as it provides the necessary light for them to navigate their surroundings. The moon and rain forest would not necessarily provide enough light for a lemur to see clearly. A dictionary has no connection to a lemur's ability to see, and wilderness is too broad of an option to be specific to this question.
living | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating, drinking, and breathing are all necessary for sustaining life. Breathing is specifically mentioned as a "key factor," which indicates that it is an essential part of living. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
distraught | Knowledge: The word "cried" suggests a strong emotional response, and the phrase "when seeing the bill" implies that the emotion was triggered by something related to money. The word "distraught" means extremely upset or overwhelmed by emotions, so this would be the most fitting choice. "Wipe eyes" and "shed tears" are more specific actions that don't capture the intensity of the emotion, while "miserable" and "sad" are too general and don't convey the specific feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions.
home or office | Knowledge: The question is asking about a location where someone can put new carpeting. The most likely options are places where people live or work, such as homes or offices. The other choices, like gym, cub, istanbul, or roon, are not relevant to the context of the question and do not provide any clues to help identify the correct answer.
underbrush | Knowledge: The verb "slither" typically implies a movement that is low to the ground and somewhat stealthy, suggesting that the snake is likely to emerge from a location that provides some cover or concealment. The option "underbrush" refers to dense vegetation close to the ground, which would provide an ideal location for a snake to hide before slithering out. The other options may not provide suitable hiding places for a snake or may not be as common habitats for snakes.
large city | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Lance enjoyed playing simulations on his computer, which suggests that he may have been building a virtual world. While all of the options are possible to build in a simulation, a large city is a common choice for simulation games where players can create and manage their own virtual metropolis. The other options, such as a university, MIT, or a post office, are less likely to be the focus of a simulation game. The option "paper" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
lower expectations | Knowledge: The word "disappointed" suggests that the people were expecting something to happen, but it did not meet their expectations. The phrase "aren't entitled to" implies that they did not have a right to expect it. Therefore, the best option is to "lower expectations" in order to avoid disappointment in the future. The other options, such as "like ice cream" or "dance well," are not related to the context of the sentence and do not offer a solution to the problem mentioned.
sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the curious child released a balloon to see where it would go, and the only choice that makes sense in this context is "sky." It is common for balloons to float upwards when released, and the sky is the most logical destination for the balloon in this scenario. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: The term "most people" suggests a general location where carrots can be commonly found, indicating that it is likely a place where a large number of people have access to them. While carrots can be found in salads and fields, these options are too specific and do not represent the most common place where people get their carrots. The other options, such as cellar or store, do not have as strong a connection to the context of the sentence as the option "supermarket," which is a common and easily accessible location for purchasing produce.
encyclopedia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the curious child is looking for information about a lizard and therefore opens up a book with a lot of information. The most likely option is an encyclopedia, which is defined as a comprehensive reference work containing information on all branches of knowledge. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and therefore can be eliminated as incorrect.
repair shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Johnny's work requires the use of a hammer, which is a common tool in repair shops. Repair shops are places where people can bring broken objects to be fixed, and typically require a variety of tools to complete repairs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not necessarily require the use of a hammer.
feel remorse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that soldiers who have been killing people during something may experience a certain emotion when they return home. The only choice that relates to emotions is "feel remorse," which means to feel regret and sadness for past actions. The other choices all relate to negative consequences or actions that may occur after returning home, but do not directly address the emotions that soldiers may experience.
castle | Knowledge: The word "rook" has multiple meanings, but in the context of explaining its name, it is likely referring to the chess piece. The chess piece "rook" is named after the tower on a medieval castle, which the piece can move in a straight line resembling the tower's vertical movement. Therefore, the correct answer is "castle." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of explaining the name of a rook.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the old lady is hiding her medicine somewhere unexpected or unusual, and the word "below" suggests that the medicine is hidden in a container. The choice "jar" works well as it is a commonly used container for storing items such as cookies or medicine. The other options (bathroom, doctor's office, taken orally, and hospital) do not fit the context of the sentence.
drinking | Knowledge: The keyword in the question is "drinking," which suggests that the people mentioned are engaged in the act of drinking something. None of the other options provide any clear indication of people drinking water, but "drinking" is a logical answer. The other options are unrelated to drinking water and do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
synagogue | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "written in Hebrew" suggests that this question is asking about a building that is associated with Jewish religious practices or culture. The options "classroom" and "suitcase" do not fit the criteria since they are not buildings. The options "library" and "library of congress" could potentially have books written in Hebrew, but they are not specifically associated with Jewish culture. The correct answer is "synagogue" since it is a building where Jewish people gather for worship and often contains a collection of Jewish religious texts written in Hebrew.
informal | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the meeting was not conducted according to standard protocol, which suggests that it was more relaxed and casual. The word "informal" means not formal or relaxed in style or atmosphere, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately describe a meeting that is not conducted according to standard protocol.
vomiting | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that drinking alcohol to excess can have negative consequences, suggesting that it leads to some sort of physical or emotional reaction. Of the choices given, vomiting is the most commonly associated with excessive drinking. This is because alcohol is a toxin that can cause nausea, and the body's natural reaction to remove it is to induce vomiting. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being slapped | Knowledge: The question suggests that if someone is very rude while expressing themselves, a negative consequence is likely to occur. Being slapped is a common response to rude behavior, and it fits with the given context of expressing oneself. The other choices do not have a clear connection to rudeness or negative consequences.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the girl who was usually ignored was now receiving attention from a boy who was flirting with her. This change in the girl's social situation is likely to make her feel happy as she is finally getting the attention she craves. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Fainting and problems are not relevant to the girl's emotional state, while anger and jealousy are more likely to be experienced if the boy was flirting with someone else.
apartment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the roommates were living in an apartment with only two bedrooms, which means there was not enough space for all three of them to have their own bedroom. Therefore, one of the roommates had to sleep on the couch in the common area of the apartment. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
peace of mind | Knowledge: Discovering the truth in a crime can provide a sense of closure and justice not only for the victim but also for the investigator. It relieves them from the burden of feeling responsible for an unsolved case and provides them with the satisfaction of knowing that they have done their job well. Therefore, finding the truth will bring peace of mind to the policeman. The other options do not reflect the positive outcome of discovering the truth in a crime.
hollow log | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel found a place to live, which is most likely a natural setting. Among the given choices, the options that don't fit this criteria are law office and in the car. Backyards could be a possibility, but the use of the phrase "hollow log" indicates that the weasel found shelter in a natural object. The forest is a natural environment where hollow logs could be found, making it a plausible but less specific answer than "hollow log."
solution to problem | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy had information that is essential for Lorna to find a solution to her problem. The other options - bus stand, turn lock, front door, and open doors - do not relate to the idea of Billy holding key information that is necessary for Lorna to find a solution to a problem.
democracy | Knowledge: The term "government" typically refers to the system of ruling and administering a country, which implies the presence of a political structure. A democracy, by definition, is a form of government where power is held by the people or their elected representatives. The other answer choices are either specific physical locations (Washington D.C, White House, Capitol Building) or vague concepts (civilization) that do not necessarily indicate the presence of a government.
farm land | Knowledge: The question asks for something that is important for farmers to have at the beginning, and "farm land" is the most essential resource for any farmer. Without land, there can be no farming. The other answer choices may also be important for farmers, but not as critical as having the actual land to work on.
keep secrets | Knowledge: The phrase "best friends" suggests a close relationship characterized by trust and intimacy. Keeping secrets is often seen as a key aspect of such a relationship, while the other options listed are more generic activities that could be done with acquaintances or less close friends.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there was a high demand for hotel rooms due to a big convention happening, which may be taking place in a city. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Michigan is a state and cannot be fully booked like hotel rooms. Bedroom and bathing refer to specific parts of a hotel room, rather than a location. A resort may have more availability than a city, as it could have more rooms, so it does not fit the context of the sentence.
orchestra | Knowledge: Playing a triangle is a musical skill, and orchestras are a type of musical ensemble that commonly use a triangle as a percussion instrument. It is unlikely that someone would be paid specifically to play a triangle in other contexts, such as a math book or math class. Music class may also be a viable option, but the specificity of the question suggests that the intended answer is orchestra. Pythagoras theorem is not related to the context of the question.
bloody mess | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the killing was brutal and messy, as the killer used a blunt instrument which would have caused a lot of bleeding. The phrase "no way to clean up" implies that the scene was too gruesome to be cleaned up easily. The options "dies," "freedom," and "sorrow" have no connection to the context of the sentence, whereas "finger prints" may have been mentioned if the focus was on the forensic aspect of the crime scene, which is not mentioned in the sentence.
grow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being talked about has not been seen in a long time and that a significant amount of time has passed. The word "young" implies that the person was once a child or young adult, and the options that suggest the person has aged or become a senior are too specific or extreme for the context. The correct answer, "grow," indicates a more general and natural progression of time and development, which is the most likely scenario when years have passed since someone was last seen.
charming | Knowledge: Real estate agents are usually trying to sell homes and make them more appealing to potential buyers. They often use descriptive language to make the home sound more attractive, such as highlighting its charm or unique features. Using negative terms like "cover up," "exaggerate," or "incompetent" would not accurately describe the typical behavior of a real estate agent. "Smile" is unrelated to describing homes and is instead a general behavior that could apply to anyone.
highways or roadsides | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the litter is thrown out of a moving car, which makes it likely to collect on a stretch of road rather than a stationary location such as a park or street corner. Highways and roadsides are common areas for litter to accumulate due to their high traffic volume and lack of regular maintenance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
room | Knowledge: The question is asking where a cat should be in a house, suggesting that there is a particular area in a house that is best for a cat. The choices "backyard" and "back yard" are not typically areas where cats would be inside a house. "Rug" and "floor" are both surfaces rather than specific areas of a house, and do not provide enough context to answer the question definitively. "Room" is the most appropriate choice because it refers to a specific area inside a house where a cat is likely to spend most of its time.
shortness of breath | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person was unable to continue running after completing 100 miles, which suggests that they were experiencing some kind of physical difficulty. The phrase "couldn't any more" implies that it was not due to losing motivation or giving up willingly. Therefore, the most likely explanation would be that they were experiencing shortness of breath, which is a common issue for endurance athletes. The other options may also be possible, but they are less directly related to the context of the sentence.
cast shadow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the building goes through a regular occurrence that can happen every day, which narrows down the choices to "it gets dark" and "casts shadow". The phrase "around half of the time" implies that the occurrence happens during a specific time of day (i.e. when the sun is at a certain angle). Since buildings do not naturally get dark on their own, "cast shadow" is the correct answer. "Face north", "target", and "fall down" do not fit the context given in the sentence.
fall asleep | Knowledge: The question is asking about the potential consequence of sitting down for an extended period, which is often associated with feeling tired or drowsy. This makes "fall asleep" the most likely answer. The other options are possible outcomes as well, but are not as directly related to sitting for a long time. For example, "sigh of relief" could be a response to discomfort, but not necessarily related to falling asleep. "Flatulence" is possible due to sitting, but not a common outcome. "Stand up" and "lap comes back" are possible, but not directly related to feeling tired after sitting for a long time.
friendly or hug | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of comforting a friend would involve showing kindness and empathy. Options "cook" or "make tea" do not necessarily relate to comforting someone, while "hurtful" is the opposite of what is expected in this situation. "Friendly" and "hug" are both appropriate ways to comfort someone who is going through a difficult time, as they demonstrate care and support.
disputes | Knowledge: When someone gains more land, it can lead to disputes with neighbors or other parties who claim ownership or use rights to that land. This can happen due to misunderstandings or disagreements about boundaries, easements, or other legal issues related to land ownership. The other options are not directly related to the negative consequences of gaining more land.
cabinet | Knowledge: A cabinet is a common storage solution for items that are not immediately needed. It provides a secure place to store items, protects them from damage, and keeps them organized. Notebooks are portable and typically used for taking notes, so they are not a good option for long-term storage. Classrooms are not typically used to store personal items. A suitcase and portfolio are designed for travel and transportation, so they would not be a practical storage solution.
tropical jungle | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the sloth was slow-moving while transitioning from one vine to another. This behavior is typical of sloths, which are arboreal animals native to the rainforests of Central and South America. The phrase "tropical jungle" is commonly used to describe the sloth's habitat, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bicycle | Knowledge: The question is asking for a device with two wheels that is popular with children. The options "coaching," "vehicle," and "car" do not fit this criteria, as they are not typically associated with children's toys or activities. The option "cars, bicycles, etc." is too broad and not specific enough. The correct answer is "bicycle," as it is a common toy and form of transportation for children, and is well-known for having two wheels.
ditch | Knowledge: Snakes often hide in places where they can stay out of sight and avoid detection, and a ditch provides a perfect hiding spot. Ditches are often overgrown with vegetation, which can provide cover for the snake, and they can also provide a convenient route for the snake to move from one area to another. The other options either do not provide enough cover or are not typically found in the United Kingdom.
bowling alley | Knowledge: The mention of carpet and hardwood floors suggests that the location has a recreational purpose as opposed to a residential location like a bedroom. Since Joe is going there to have a good time with his friends, it's likely a social location. Among the given options, a bowling alley is the most logical choice as they typically have a mix of carpet and hardwood floors for players to walk on. The other options, such as a hotel or a zoo, do not have any clear connection to the context.
cage  | Knowledge: The question is asking where it is safer to keep a marmot, suggesting that there may be risks involved in keeping them in certain places. While it is possible to keep a marmot as a pet, it is important to provide a secure enclosure for their safety and the safety of those around them. A cage is a common way to keep marmots safely contained, and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not offer the same level of security or protection, and may not be suitable for keeping a marmot.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the state in question is mitten-shaped, which is a well-known descriptor for the state of Michigan. Additionally, tennis courts are commonly found at country clubs and health clubs, which are listed as options in the choices. Florida is not mitten-shaped and does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The phrase "very high tech computers" suggests that the computers being referred to are advanced and sophisticated, which are often found in professional settings such as offices. While it is possible to have high tech computers in other locations like a library or home, the tone of the sentence implies that they are most commonly found in a workplace. The space shuttle may have advanced technology, but it is not a location where computers are typically found. "Desktop" is not a location, but rather a type of computer.
store | Knowledge: "Store" is the most likely answer because it is a place where someone can purchase goods or services in exchange for money. "Pocket" refers to where someone might keep money, but it is not a place where money can be spent. "Casino" is a place where people gamble with money, but not necessarily spend it on goods or services. "Supermarket" and "cash register" are places where people can buy goods, but they are not the only places where someone can spend money.
standstill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the announcement was unexpected and confusing, and it had a significant impact on the nation. Bringing the nation to a standstill implies that the announcement was so significant that it caused people to pause or stop what they were doing. This kind of impact would not be associated with pain, scandal or controversy, as those ideas suggest negative reactions to the announcement, whereas standstill implies that the reaction was more neutral, perhaps just shock or surprise.
recession | Knowledge: Inflation and recession are often viewed as opposing economic forces. Inflation can cause prices to rise, which reduces the value of money, while a recession is characterized by a decrease in economic activity and spending. Fighting inflation can help to prevent a recession by keeping prices stable and maintaining the value of money. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backpack | Knowledge: The question suggests that the notebook is something that the person carries with them when it is not in use. Lockers, desktops, classrooms, and offices are all stationary locations, which means it is less likely that the person is carrying their notebook with them in those places. A backpack, however, is a portable item that is often used to carry personal belongings including a notebook, so it is the most likely choice.
hear testimony | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the answer is related to something that happens in a court of law to satisfy or alleviate curiosity. Hearing testimony is a common practice in court where witnesses or experts are called to provide sworn statements of their knowledge or observations related to the case. The other options like searching on a computer or surfing the net are not related to the traditional court setting and therefore, can be ruled out. Examining something or seeing exhibits may be part of some court proceedings, but it does not necessarily alleviate curiosity.
arrive late | Knowledge: The sentence compares the punctuality of trains and airplanes, suggesting that one is typically on time while the other is not. The phrase "on the other hand" further emphasizes this contrast. Of the choices, "arrive late" is the most fitting option, as it aligns with the idea that airplanes are less reliable in terms of timing. The other options are either irrelevant or do not correspond to the context of the sentence.
sitting down | Knowledge: The question is asking for what is necessary to do before beginning work on a computer, and out of the choices given, only "sitting down" makes logical sense as a step to take before starting work. Screaming for hours, panicking, being tired, and procrastinating are not productive or necessary steps to take before starting work on a computer, and would likely hinder productivity instead of helping it.
amount to nothing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are two types of people: those who make an effort and succeed in life, and those who do not put in any effort and fail to achieve anything. The phrase "amount to nothing" is commonly used to describe people who have no accomplishments or success in their lives. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
strip mall | Knowledge: Strip malls are commonly known for housing a variety of smaller businesses and service providers, such as dental offices, hair salons, and small shops. This is distinct from a medical building, which is usually larger and serves as a hub for medical professionals and services. Town and urban area are too broad and vague to give a clear answer, while an office can refer to any type of workplace and is not specific enough to indicate that there is a dental office present.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a personal washing machine is being referred to, which implies that it is a smaller appliance meant for personal use rather than for commercial cleaning services. The other options do not make sense in the context of a personal washing machine. Clean dishes are typically washed in a dishwasher, laundromats are used for larger loads of laundry, streets have no connection to washing machines, and cellars are not typically used for washing clothes.
soccer field | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that kicking a ball is related to a particular activity or location. Soccer is a sport that involves kicking a ball, and games are typically played on a specific type of field designed for this sport. A child's hand and toy store may be related to playing with a ball, but the context of the sentence indicates that the activity being referred to is a sport. Arena does not necessarily imply a specific activity, and could refer to various types of events being held there.
ground | Knowledge: Lightning rods work by providing a path of least resistance for lightning to follow, directing the electrical charge into the ground where it can safely dissipate. Therefore, the end of a steel cable used as a lightning rod would need to be connected to the ground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
jealousy | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker is comparing themselves to others and feeling inadequate, specifically in regards to what everyone else has that they do not. This suggests that the correct answer is jealousy, as the feeling of envy or coveting what others have is a common cause of social discomfort and exhaustion. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
calculus | Knowledge: Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of continuous change. Attributes typically involve measuring the rate of change, such as the slope or curvature of a graph, which would require the use of calculus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of calculating attributes.
being imprisoned | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of killing has legal consequences, which may include being punished for the crime by being imprisoned. The other options do not address the legal aspect of the question and are not likely consequences for this particular situation.
feel full | Knowledge: Having a light, healthy lunch typically means that you are consuming foods that are low in calories and high in nutrients. These types of foods can promote feelings of fullness and satiety without causing discomfort or digestive issues like vomiting. Feeling satisfied is also a possible outcome of having a light, healthy lunch. Spending money may or may not be related to this question, depending on the context. Obesity is not likely to be a direct result of having a light, healthy lunch, but it could be a long-term consequence of consistently making healthy food choices.
Prince Edward Island | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the focus is on a Canadian farmer who is wondering if potatoes will grow in his location. Prince Edward Island is known for its potato farming industry and is often referred to as the "Potato Capital of Canada." Ireland is also known for its potato farming, but it is not related to the context of the Canadian farmer. "Main course" and "French fries" are not locations but rather food-related terms. Idaho is known for its potato farming industry as well, but the sentence mentions that the farmer is located in Canada, not the United States.
art show | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the picture was created by a professional artist, and the option "art show" is the most likely place where a professional's work would be displayed. Art shows are exhibitions where artists showcase their work to the public, and these events provide a platform for artists to sell their work to collectors and enthusiasts. The other options, such as "wall" or "shelf," do not provide enough context to determine where a professional's work might be displayed.
can | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Bob needed a container to keep the ball bearings from scattering around. A can is a common item used to store small objects like screws, bolts, and ball bearings. Machines and high quality motors may use ball bearings, but it does not make sense for Bob to store loose ball bearings in a machine or motor. The pool and church have no relevance to the sentence.
eye strain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person may be experiencing discomfort from using a computer at night. This discomfort is likely to be caused by eye strain, as looking at a bright screen in a dark room can be tiring for the eyes. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not offer any explanation for the person's behavior.
talk about themselves | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person next to the speaker is talking on her cell phone a lot, which implies that she is likely engaged in conversation. The option "talk about themselves" is the most relevant because it fits the context of someone talking on their phone frequently. None of the other options are directly related to talking on a cell phone.
scheme | Knowledge: The word "pawn" suggests that the person was being used or manipulated by their partner for a larger purpose. The fact that the police were involved suggests that the scheme may have been illegal or unethical. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the meaning of the word "pawn."
go outside | Knowledge: The sentence implies that smoking is not allowed inside the building and that if someone wanted to smoke, they would have to go outside. The other options (unhealthy, coughing, foolish, inhale) are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any logical connection to the idea of smoking outside.
easy life | Knowledge: The word "lazy" suggests that the person wants to minimize effort and avoid difficulty, making an "easy life" the most logical answer. The other options may be desirable, but they do not necessarily relate to a lazy person's desires. However, it is important to note that this question relies heavily on subjective interpretation and individual perspectives on laziness.
building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boat needs to be stored during the harsh winters. While a locker or a warehouse could be possible options for boat storage, the most commonly used option is a dedicated building, such as a boathouse or a storage facility. Michigan is one of the Great Lakes and is not a location for boat storage. In the cupboard is not a feasible answer as it is not large enough to store a boat.
vertigo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual is feeling a sensation of spinning while climbing. Vertigo is a medical term that refers to a feeling of dizziness or spinning, usually caused by a problem with the inner ear or the brain. It is commonly associated with heights, motion sickness, and certain medical conditions. The other options do not accurately match the symptoms described in the sentence.
lies | Knowledge: Perjury is a term used to describe lying under oath or providing false information while testifying in court. Therefore, the correct answer would be lies as someone committing perjury would likely be providing false information. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the definition of perjury. A miscarriage of justice could result from perjury, but it is not a characteristic of the person committing perjury. Guilt may or may not be a factor for someone committing perjury. Truth and testify are not directly related to the act of committing perjury.
downtown area | Knowledge: The sentence implies that theaters have a common location, and the context suggests that this location is likely to be in a city or urban area. The choice "shopping mall" is unlikely, as theaters are not often found within shopping malls. "In buildings" is too vague, as many different types of buildings could house theaters. "New York City" may be a valid option, but the phrase "typically located" suggests that the answer should apply to theaters in general, not just those in one specific city. "Populated area" is also vague and could apply to many different types of locations. Therefore, "downtown area" is the most appropriate choice, as many theaters are often found in the downtown areas of cities.
public office | Knowledge: The term "weasel" is often used to describe politicians who are sneaky or untrustworthy. Public office is a position that involves political power and decision-making, making it a likely target for this type of criticism. The other options, such as "out of doors" or "swimming pool," do not have any clear connection to politics or the negative connotation associated with the term "weasel."
work | Knowledge: "Adult engineer" implies that the person is a professional in the field of engineering. It is reasonable to assume that an engineer would spend most of their time working on engineering-related tasks, whether it be designing, researching, or managing projects. None of the other answer choices have a clear connection to the profession of engineering.
become depressed | Knowledge: Losing a pet, especially a beloved dog, can be a very emotional experience. The sentence implies that the person had a negative emotional response to the news of their dog running away, which is similar to feeling depressed. The other options do not relate to the emotional state of the person in this scenario.
enthusiastic | Knowledge: The sentence presents a contrast between the man's negative prospects and his positive attitude. The word "enthusiastic" is the most appropriate choice because it implies that the man is hopeful and excited about the future, despite his current difficulties. The other options, such as "splendid" and "glorious," are too positive and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Cheerful" and "excited" are somewhat related, but do not convey the same level of optimism and energy as "enthusiastic."
wall | Knowledge: The use of the words "joinery" and "paneling" suggest that the craftsman created a decorative or ornate surface for a vertical surface, which would be a wall. The other choices are all types of doors, which would not typically be decorated with joinery and paneling.
managed | Knowledge: The sentence implies that despite struggling with a mental illness, the individual was able to handle it to some extent. Therefore, "managed" is the most logical choice among the given options. "Recur" means to happen again or repeatedly, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. "Cause irrational behavior" and "cause hallucination" are both negative outcomes of mental illness, and it doesn't align with the idea that the individual was able to handle it to some extent. "Effectively treated" is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily align with the idea that she still had mental illness her whole life.
texas | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Sarah couldn't stand living without an air conditioner during the summer, which suggests that she is in a hot location. The option "texas" is the most logical choice as it is a state known for its hot and humid summers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feel close to | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people spend time chatting with friends for a specific reason. The option "moroseness" is unlikely to be the reason since it means being in a sad or gloomy mood. "Laughter" is often a byproduct of spending time with friends, but it is not the primary reason. "Gathering of information" is also unlikely to be the reason since it suggests a more formal or professional setting. Instead, the most likely reason is to feel closer to their friends, which is a common motivation for socializing with others. The option "feel relaxed" may also be a possible answer, but it is not as clear-cut as the option "feel close to."
stockmarket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to improve their ability to save for retirement, which typically involves investing money in order to grow wealth over time. The stock market is a common avenue for long-term investing, as it provides the opportunity to earn returns on shares of companies that perform well over time. None of the other options have any clear connection to investing or saving for retirement.
football game | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a referee blowing a whistle and citing a rule in reference to a play, which is a common occurrence in sports games such as football. The option "superbowl" further reinforces the idea that the sentence refers to a high-profile, competitive game. The other options, such as "classroom" and "family situation," do not match the context of the sentence.
searching for | Knowledge: The other options are not typically associated with finding information. Asking questions may be a part of the process, but it is not the main method of finding information. Logic is a tool used to analyze and understand information, but it is not a means of finding it. Engaging in tasks and using time may help in gathering information, but they are not direct methods of finding it. Searching for information involves actively looking for it through various sources and methods.
market | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for vegetables, which is commonly associated with shopping at a market. Additionally, the option "bookstore" does not relate to the context of the sentence, while the options "library" and "train station" are unlikely places to buy magazines. The option "gardening" could be a possibility, but it is less likely than "market" since the sentence implies that the person is already at a location where they can buy vegetables.
Any of the choices could be correct depending on the context. | Knowledge: Going into a trance can have different effects depending on the individual and the situation. Disorientation, confusion, and loss of control are common experiences during some forms of trance, while closed eyes and hallucinations may also occur in some cases. Without more context for this question, it is impossible to determine which of the choices is the correct answer.
slow down  | Knowledge: The question implies that the train is approaching a station and must take a certain action before reaching it. The most logical action for a train to take before arriving at a station is to slow down to a safe speed. The other options do not fit the context of the question or are unlikely scenarios. A train passing slowly or slowing past a stop are not clear actions and arriving early or late are outcomes, not actions.
feeling tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had been sleeping in and feeling tired all day. Therefore, switching to getting up early must have made a difference by making him feel refreshed. This means that feeling tired is the opposite of feeling refreshed, and is the correct answer. Bloodshot eyes, alertness, starting early, and happy are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
having friends | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy has a skill in making friends. Therefore, the most immediate and obvious result of this skill would be that he would have friends. Popularity, happiness, good feeling, and conflict could also be possible outcomes, but they are not as directly related to the boy's ability to make friends as having friends themselves.
drive train | Knowledge: The word "engineer" commonly refers to a person who designs, builds, operates, or maintains machinery and systems, including trains. Therefore, it is likely that an engineer would be responsible for driving a train while on the job. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: The context implies that the question is asking for a safe place to keep personal money. Out of all the choices, keeping money in a pocket would likely be the safest option as it is close to the body and can easily be monitored. Supermarkets and art shows do not have any relevance to the question, while keeping money in a cash register or a bucket of water would be risky and not a recommended practice.
high school | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to a place where adults gather to watch football games. While college campuses may also have football fields where people gather, the use of the word "high school" suggests that this is the intended answer. High school football games are often a social event for adults in the community, and the other options do not provide any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
creativity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was using his imagination to create a pretend scenario where regular items were parts of his spaceship. This requires the ability to think creatively and come up with innovative ideas. The other options, such as acting skills or alien intelligence, don't fit as well with the context of the sentence.
thinking | Knowledge: The word "communicating" suggests that the correct answer involves a method of exchanging information. The word "aliens" suggests that this exchange may not be a communication method commonly used by humans. The options "effort," "farting," "laugh," and "medium" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, but "thinking" could be a possible answer as it is a communication method used by most intelligent species. "Speculating" suggests that this is not a proven fact, but rather a hypothesis or theory.
faithful | Knowledge: The phrase "man's best friend" is often used to describe dogs, indicating a strong bond and loyalty between humans and dogs. This loyalty can be attributed to the pack mentality of dogs, which makes them highly social animals that thrive on companionship and loyalty. The other options in the choices do not relate to the idea of loyalty, making "faithful" the correct answer.
voice | Knowledge: The sentence refers to the act of talking, which involves producing sound waves in the air that can be heard by others. The answer choice "voice" specifically relates to the sound waves produced by the vocal cords in the throat when speaking. The other answer choices, such as "being alive" or "brain," are not directly related to the act of talking and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
car wheel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cleanup crew is finding something on the highway during cleanup, and they always come off of a specific object. The options "propeller," "datahub," "wash," and "electric fan" do not make sense in this context. However, it is common to find hubcaps or other small parts from car wheels on the side of the road during highway cleanup, making "car wheel" the most likely answer.
box | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the delivery man brought a new computer that is being delivered to the recipient. The recipient's anticipation to open it implies that the computer is inside a box. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence.
servant | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person being referred to was a servant, as indicated by the fact that they were asked where to put flowers. The other options, such as celebrity or rich person, do not fit the description of someone who would be tasked with arranging flowers at a wedding.
movie theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the behavior being described is considered rude in a certain context where people watch something. The options "fair," "carnival," and "bowling alley" do not typically involve quiet activities that require concentration or have a social expectation of silence, so they can be eliminated. The option "classroom" could be a possibility, but this context usually involves interaction between a teacher and students, so noise and commentary could be appropriate depending on the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is "movie theatre," where people usually watch movies in a quiet and respectful environment.
living room | Knowledge: Watching television is a common activity that takes place in a comfortable and relaxed setting, such as a living room in a house. Parks are usually outdoor recreational spaces, and motels are temporary lodgings that may not have a separate area for watching TV. Bars may have TVs, but they are not typically associated with a family-friendly atmosphere for watching TV together.
make progress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action taken is advancing towards a particular goal. "Make trouble" and "gone to sleep" are opposite actions to progress. "Take time" and "make haste" are actions that focus on the speed of the action but do not necessarily imply progress towards a goal. Therefore, "make progress" is the best answer.
roof | Knowledge: The question implies that snow can cause damage if there is too much of it in a certain location. Out of the five choices, roofs are the most likely to be damaged by excessive snowfall, as the weight of the snow can exceed the load capacity of the structure, causing it to collapse. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
feathers | Knowledge: Feathers are a distinctive feature of birds and are often used for flight or insulation. It is common for birds to shed their feathers during moulting season, and they can also lose feathers due to injury or stress. The other options, such as wings and legs, are important parts of a bird's anatomy but are not typically known to "fall off." The option about keeping in a zoo is not relevant to the question.
pantry | Knowledge: Bread is typically stored at room temperature in a breadbox or pantry, as refrigeration can cause the bread to become stale and the moisture can cause mold to grow more quickly. Storing bread in a plastic bag can reduce air circulation and cause condensation, which can also lead to mold growth. Toasters are used for heating bread, not storing it. A box may be used for storage, but it depends on the specific type of box and whether it provides adequate ventilation.
hospital | Knowledge: The word "suffering" is a clue that indicates a medical problem. The other options do not provide a suitable location for someone who needs medical attention. A reception area in a hospital is typically where patients wait to receive medical treatment, making it the most appropriate answer. The other options, such as motels, drug stores, and hotels, do not usually have medical facilities, and people is not a specific location.
 |  | bus stop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that it is cold outside, and there is a place where you can stand in a line without needing a coat. A bus stop is a common location where people stand in line, and it also has a shelter that may provide some protection from the cold weather. The other options, such as a good book, a triangle, or a graph, do not have any connection to the idea of standing in a line without needing a coat.
do well | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hard work will lead to a positive outcome, which is commonly associated with doing well or succeeding. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
state park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's living situation is not allowed due to a certain restriction. Living in a state park is often prohibited due to environmental impact concerns and the desire to preserve natural habitats. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dry out  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jon put drops in his eyes to prevent them from becoming too dry. If the eyes become too dry, they can become irritated and uncomfortable, so it is common to use drops to help keep them lubricated. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the issue of dryness in the eyes.
make friends | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has not been in their hometown for a long time and upon returning, they express a desire to build new relationships by making friends. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence; forgiving, buying presents for others, and loving do not have a clear connection to the idea of returning to one's hometown and building new relationships.
compost pile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described is related to leaf removal or disposal. The word "rake" implies that the leaves are being gathered and moved intentionally. The options "forest," "floral arrangement," and "basement" do not make sense in this context. "Trees" could be a possible answer, but it does not fully capture the action of actively removing and disposing of leaves. "Compost pile" is the best answer as it is a common and practical way to dispose of leaves and turn them into nutrient-rich compost.
company | Knowledge: The term "mid-ranking officer" implies that James is not in charge of a large military unit like an army, but rather a smaller group. The term "company" is commonly used to describe a military unit consisting of 80-250 individuals, which matches the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "battle" or "army", refer to larger military groups and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Pack" and "renegades" are not commonly used to describe military units.
furniture store | Knowledge: The options "library", "ocean", "bedroom", and "bookends" do not make sense as they are not places where someone would typically purchase a new bookshelf. A "furniture store" is a logical choice as it is a place where someone would go to purchase furniture, including bookshelves.
call child | Knowledge: The context suggests that the situation involves a parent who is concerned about their child's lack of socialization and exposure to the outside world. The most appropriate action to take in this situation would be to call the child and take steps to encourage them to engage in activities outside the home and interact with other people. The other options do not provide a practical solution to the problem described in the question.
highway | Knowledge: Changing lanes is a driving technique primarily used on roads and highways, which makes choices such as grocery store, bowling alley, and rural countryside irrelevant. The correct answer, therefore, is highway, whereas street could have also been an option but does not specify the type of road, making it less specific.
family | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Mario was away from his family, and he was excited to meet them. "At home" and "being here" do not provide any relevant information about who Mario met, while "present" and "home team" are not related to the context of the sentence.
It depends on the individual's experience, so there is no correct answer.
refineries | Knowledge: Gasoline is not naturally occurring and needs to be processed in order to be used as fuel. Refineries are specifically designed to convert crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products. The other options are not relevant as they do not involve the process of creating gasoline from crude oil.
orchard | Knowledge: The question asks where millions of apple trees can be found, and an orchard is a place where fruit trees are grown for commercial purposes. Apple orchards are particularly common in certain regions, such as Washington state in the United States, which is known for producing a large amount of apples. The other options do not suggest a clear connection to the context of the question, and therefore are unlikely to be the correct answer.
mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed new clothes before starting high school. The most likely place to find new clothes for school would be a mall, which typically has a variety of clothing stores. The other options, such as ocean floor, container, or downtown area, do not have any logical connection to the sentence.
better knowledge | Knowledge: The question is asking what a teacher is required to do for her students. The correct answer would be to provide them with knowledge to improve their education. State facts may be part of teaching, but it is not specific to what a teacher is required to do. Making lunch and timing tests are not necessarily requirements for a teacher, and grouping students may be a strategy but not a requirement.
play chess | Knowledge: The question is asking for a good activity for two children to do together, which rules out solitary activities like watching television or listening to music. The choices "reach over" and "running" are not specific enough to be considered activities on their own. However, "play chess" is a two-player game that requires both players to participate and can be a fun and engaging activity for children to do together.
pass course | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the rich kid tried to bribe the professor with money to achieve a certain outcome. The only option that makes sense in this context is "pass course." The other options do not fit the situation described in the sentence.
orchestra | Knowledge: The question mentions a musician playing a specific instrument, the snare drum, in a specific location, a theater. While the other choices may also involve music performances, they do not involve the specific instrument or location mentioned in the question. An orchestra is a group of musicians who perform together in a theater and typically includes a percussion section, which would likely include a snare drum player.
western | Knowledge: The question asks for the opposite of "someone from the east." The options "north" and "westward" are directions and do not refer to people specifically. "Westerly" is an adjective that describes something that is located in or moving toward the west, and "eastside" refers to a particular location within a larger area. Therefore, "western" is the only option that specifically refers to someone who is not from the east, as it refers to people or things from the western direction.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah has skill with a brass drum, which is a common instrument used in marching bands. This is further supported by Jane's request for Sarah to join her, which implies that the performance is likely a marching band concert. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
freedom from want | Knowledge: The term "minimalist" is often associated with a lifestyle that emphasizes simplifying one's possessions and focusing on experiences rather than material things. Therefore, it makes sense that the desired outcome for someone who has become a minimalist would be to achieve freedom from wanting or desiring more material possessions. The other options, such as peaceful sleep or a new computer, do not align with the ideals of minimalist living.
deception | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is being dishonest, which means they are intentionally misleading others. Deception is a term commonly used to describe such behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Live in poverty refers to a state of financial deprivation, bad feelings is too general and doesn't address the context of the sentence, bipolar and schizophrenia are mental health conditions and not related to dishonesty.
sea | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crew is being affected by the heat from the sun. The second part of the sentence indicates that the sun's heat is being reflected off something, which is causing additional heat. The options "moon," "desktop," and "beach" do not make sense in this context. The choice "sea" is the most logical, as the sun's rays reflect off the surface of the water, intensifying the heat.
ask | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sender of the follow-up email did not receive a reply to their previous email. Therefore, the purpose of the follow-up email would be to inquire about the lack of response, or to ask for a response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be appropriate choices for the correct answer.
store or restaurant | Knowledge: Whipped cream is typically not kept in a cupboard or refrigerator at home, unless it was just made. Whipped cream can usually be found in a store in a can or tub, or in a restaurant as a topping for desserts or drinks.
acknowledgment | Knowledge: The question asks about what makes a person feel good, which is a subjective feeling. However, research suggests that receiving acknowledgment or praise for one's actions or accomplishments can boost self-esteem and increase feelings of happiness. The other options may also contribute to positive feelings, but may not be as universally applicable as receiving acknowledgment.
disorientation | Knowledge: Alcohol is known to impair cognitive and motor functioning, leading to a state of disorientation. This can manifest in symptoms such as difficulty walking, slurred speech, and confusion. The other options are not typically associated with the effects of alcohol consumption.
It is not possible to determine the correct answer without additional context or information.
pharmacy | Knowledge: Pharmacies typically sell medications, health and beauty products, and sometimes snacks and drinks, but they do not usually sell seasonal items like suntan lotion. The other options, like deli counters, grocery stores, and shops could potentially sell suntan lotion alongside food items. Beach bags are not places that sell anything, but rather an accessory used to carry items to the beach.
pedaling | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Jane wants to ride a bike, which requires the skill of pedaling. Pedaling is the action of pushing the bike's pedals with your feet to move the bike forward. Laying down, falling over, and falling off are not skills needed to ride a bike; rather, they are accidental mishaps that may occur while learning to ride. Peddle is a misspelling of pedaling.
vote | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the special interest group was manipulating young people into believing they were making a difference, but really were just trying to maintain the two party political system. The option "vote" makes sense in this context, as it implies that the group may have been trying to influence young people to vote for their preferred political party or candidate. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
replica | Knowledge: A replica is an exact copy or reproduction of an object, including all of its details and features. Therefore, making a new copy of an original sculpture would result in a replica. The other options (copy, derivative, remake, and reproduction) could also technically apply, but they may not convey the same level of precision and accuracy as a replica.
michigan  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bee had to be moved to a warmer climate during the winter, which means that the bee's original habitat was a location with colder winters. Michigan is a state in the northern United States known for its harsh winters, so it is the most likely option among the given choices. The other options (United States, sky, China, apiary) do not provide any specific information about the bee's original location.
summer | Knowledge: Apple trees typically bloom in the spring and produce fruit in the summer, with apples ripening at different times depending on the variety. Fall is when apples are typically harvested, indicating that the apples on the tree are ready to eat. Valley and Washington State are locations and have no relevance to the question.
have fun | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a common reason why people take dance classes. One possible reason is that they find it enjoyable, which would explain why almost all people take dance classes. Other options, such as expressing oneself or deepening a relationship, may be secondary reasons or specific to certain individuals, but having fun is generally the primary motivation for taking dance classes.
turn away | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person valued privacy and did not want people to watch them. "Turn away" is an action that would allow the person to act without being directly observed. The other options, such as rowing a boat or letting down something, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
america | Knowledge: The sentence implies that fast food restaurants are ubiquitous in a particular country, which narrows down the options to locations within that country. The options "new york," "strip mall," "big cities," and "center of town" are all specific locations within a country or city, whereas "america" refers to an entire country. This knowledge, combined with the common perception that fast food restaurants are prevalent in America, supports the correct answer being "america."
purchase | Knowledge: The sentence implies a transactional process between a customer and a store. In order to acquire something from a store legally and ethically, one must purchase it by paying for it with money. Stealing is obviously not a correct answer as it is illegal and unethical. "Work hard" and "proactive" do not make sense in the context of getting something from a store. "Reach for" implies physical action, but does not necessarily result in obtaining the desired item from the store.
the rink | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the injury is related to using a skate, which is a type of ice skate. Therefore, the most likely place for obtaining such an injury would be at an ice rink, where people commonly use skates for activities such as figure skating or ice hockey. The other options are not directly related to this context and do not provide any specific information about where the injury might occur.
getting high | Knowledge: The phrase "being caught" suggests that the celebrities in question did something they weren't supposed to do, and the word "useful" implies that going public helped them in some way. "High heel shoes" and "wide acceptance" don't seem relevant to the context of being caught, while "problems" is too vague. "Press coverage" could be a possibility, but it doesn't quite fit with the idea of being caught doing something wrong. "Getting high" is the best answer as it suggests a behavior that is socially unacceptable and could lead to negative repercussions if exposed.
glee | Knowledge: The phrase "having fun in a big way" suggests that the experience is a positive one, which eliminates the options for stress relief, injuries, and hunger. Additionally, the phrase "having fun" is often associated with happiness and joy, which aligns with the choice of "glee". The final option, "may laugh," is not specific enough and does not capture the full range of emotions that someone having fun may feel.
music room | Knowledge: A teacher would likely store their piano in a place related to their profession, seeing as the question is about a teacher's piano. The options 'music class', 'band' and 'music room' all relate to the teaching of music, while a 'piano store' is a business that sells pianos and would be an unlikely place for someone to store their piano. Therefore, 'music room' is the most appropriate answer.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dad saw random stuff in the kitchen and didn't know where to put it, so he placed it somewhere in the kitchen. Out of the given choices, "table" is the most logical option because it is often used as a surface to place random items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
increase | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the temperature was not sufficient for cooking turkey, which implies that it needed to be higher than it currently was. The options "drop rapidly," "lower temperature," and "drop to zero" all imply a decrease in temperature, which would make the situation worse. "Heat up" is a synonym for "increase," but "increase" is a more direct and specific answer to the question.
commit crime | Knowledge: The phrase "get in trouble" often refers to breaking laws or regulations. Therefore, the option "commit crime" is the most relevant choice. The other options do not necessarily relate to legal trouble, as mail order and branch out refer to business practices, liquidated refers to ending a business, and procure refers to obtaining goods or services.
opera house or theatre | Knowledge: The use of the terms "orchestra pit" and "players coming on stage" suggest that Sally is in a venue where performances take place. The options that best fit this description are opera houses, auditoriums, music halls, and theaters. However, the term "butt" has no connection to the context of the sentence and would not be a plausible answer.
refrigerator | Knowledge: Wire shelving is commonly used in refrigerators to allow air to circulate and keep food items cool. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of wire shelving.
drawer  | Knowledge: Utensils are typically stored in a drawer in the kitchen, making it the most plausible answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A backpack is not a typical storage location for utensils, a plate is a utensil itself and not a storage location, dinner is a meal and not a storage location, and a cupboard is a possible storage location but not the most common one for utensils.
inside joke | Knowledge: The use of the word "close" in the sentence suggests that the joke was only understood by a select group of people, which is commonly associated with an inside joke. An inside joke is a type of humor that can only be appreciated by a group of people who share a common experience, such as close friends. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
attempt to escape  | Knowledge: The phrase "get in more trouble" implies that the prisoner is already in trouble and is at risk of further punishment. Attempting to escape is a serious offense in prison and is likely to result in additional charges and harsher punishment. The other options may not necessarily result in more trouble for the prisoner or are unrelated to the context of the sentence (e.g. "fast for days").
grow tall | Knowledge: The question is asking what trees do in order to reach sunlight when they are densely packed in a forest. Growing tall is a common adaptation among trees in this situation, as it allows them to reach above other trees and foliage to get access to sunlight. None of the other choices make as much sense in this context - burning, walling in or being covered in snow would all be detrimental to the trees, while growing in soil is a given for any plant.
american southwest | Knowledge: The reference to old cowboy and Indians movies suggests a Western theme, which typically takes place in the American Southwest. Horses are an integral part of Western culture, and the region is known for its vast open spaces and rugged terrain, making it a natural setting for these movies. While other regions, such as Canada or England, may have horses and movies set in the past, they are not typically associated with the cowboy and Indians genre. The Triple Crown and Kentucky Derby are both horse races, but they do not relate to the context of cowboy and Indians movies.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sporting goods stores are typically found in larger commercial areas like shopping squares or malls, but the privately owned shop being referred to is located somewhere smaller. The word "there" indicates that the location is not far away from the speaker. Among the choices, town seems to be the best fit as it suggests a smaller urban area that is not too far away. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not suggest a smaller urban area or do not make sense in the context of a sporting goods store.
tension | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is feeling guilty about committing perjury, so there is likely to be some discomfort or unease in her interaction with the prosecutor. This discomfort is described as a feeling of tension between them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not likely to be associated with the emotional experience of someone who is committing perjury.
military base | Knowledge: The use of the term "servicemen" suggests that Jamie may be on a military base or near a location where military personnel are frequently found. The other options, such as a shopping mall or school, do not have a connection to the presence of servicemen in the context of the sentence.
join | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone were to abandon a pet at a shelter, the pet may be able to find a new family. The word "join" suggests that the pet would become a member of a new family, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit the context or have a negative connotation (such as "infect").
make money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is more focused on the financial aspect of their work rather than the emotional or personal satisfaction. The phrase "bottom line" is a common business term referring to the final result or profit of a project. The other options such as "happiness," "very nice," "inspiration," and "fulfilling" do not indicate a desire for financial gain.
strength | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man's disability was turned into a positive attribute, which could be described as a source of strength. A strength can be seen as a personal quality that helps someone overcome challenges, which fits well with the idea of a motivational speaker. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or do not fit as well with the idea of turning a disability into an asset.
transportation  | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that it is referring to the act of moving or traveling from one place to another by means of a vehicle. The term "transportation" is often used to describe the act of moving people or goods from one place to another, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options, such as traffic jams and traffic accidents, are not accurate descriptions of the act of traveling from one place to another.
oral | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had prepared a contract outlining the terms of his BDSM relationship with his new partner, and had it signed before allowing them to perform a certain act on him. The act is indicated to be something that involves the mouth, which narrows down the options to "oral." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the nature of the BDSM relationship described.
invisible | Knowledge: The sentence tells us that there are two doors on opposite sides of Broom, but he couldn't see them. This implies that the doors are not visible to him, suggesting that they might be hidden or disguised in some way. The option "invisible" fits this description, while the other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the doors cannot be seen.
laundromat | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker needed to wash their jeans because their electricity was cut off, which means they may not have access to a washing machine at home. A laundromat typically provides public access to washing machines and dryers, making it the most likely choice for where the speaker went. The other options are less relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not have any clear connection to washing clothes.
strange | Knowledge: The use of "wildly erratic" suggests that the results were very unpredictable and inconsistent, which would make it difficult to obtain an accurate average. The word "strange" also fits with the idea of something being unpredictable and unusual. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
exposure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James had difficulty learning French because of a lack of something, and the choices provided each represent a possible reason for his struggle. However, the word "never" in the sentence indicates that James may never have had a chance to experience something that would have made learning French easier. Exposure to a language means having contact with it, such as hearing it spoken or reading it in context, and is a crucial factor in language acquisition. The other choices do not fit as well because they all imply some degree of action or intention on James' part, which conflicts with the idea that he never had a particular experience.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that answering uninteresting questions would result in a negative emotion. Boredom is a common feeling associated with lack of interest or stimulation, so it is the most likely answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
home | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the living room is a place where the family gathers, which is a common feature of a home. Additionally, the use of the word "common" suggests that this is an area of the house that is used frequently and is a central part of family life, which is also typical of a home. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a porch and formal seating are more specific areas within a home, a friend's house is not part of the living room, and an apartment could also have a living room but may not have the same connotations of family life.
propeller | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Lara was checking on something that could cause harm if it came loose. The options "electric fan", "datahub", "car wheel", and "gasoline" do not fit the context of the sentence. However, a loose propeller on a plane or helicopter could potentially cause a catastrophic accident that could result in the deaths of many people. Therefore, the correct answer is "propeller".
shop, department store, mall | Knowledge: These options are all common places where people can buy clothing and appliances. A shop generally refers to a small store that specializes in a particular type of product, while a department store is larger and offers a variety of products in different departments. A mall is a large indoor shopping complex with a mix of stores and restaurants. Closet and garage sale are not typical places where people would buy new clothing and appliances.
sense of balance | Knowledge: Learning to ride a bike without training wheels requires the development of a sense of balance, which allows a person to maintain their equilibrium while in motion. While pedalling and practicing are both important parts of the process, neither can be effective without a sense of balance. Good balance is a key factor in being able to ride a bike, and doing wheelies is an advanced skill that requires a high level of balance mastery.
fail to work | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone may not like machines for a specific reason, which is that they can fail to work. This can be frustrating and may discourage people from using machines. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not provide a reason for why someone would not like machines.
live life | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Betty considers being in love to be an important aspect of life. The other options may be associated with being in love, but not necessarily seen as necessary or vital according to the context of the sentence.
live life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that love encourages people to fully engage with life and not hold back. "Live life" is a common expression that means to seize opportunities and make the most out of experiences, which is consistent with the idea that love can give people a sense of purpose and motivation. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wanted to play an instrument that would stand out and be heard over other noise, which is a characteristic commonly associated with marching bands. Marching bands often play loud, upbeat music during parades and sporting events, so it makes sense that someone would want to play an instrument that would cut through the noise. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
attempt suicide | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is unhappy and looking for a way to end their suffering. While going to the doctor may help with certain aspects of their unhappiness, it may not necessarily end their overall suffering. "Further cause" and "wave goodbye" do not seem relevant to the context of the question. "Thank god" may indicate gratitude, but it is unlikely to provide a solution to the person's unhappiness. "Attempt suicide" is unfortunately a common and tragic way that some unhappy people might try to end their suffering.
None of the choices are correct.
raise interest rates | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the business show is discussing ways to fight inflation, and one of the options mentioned is to use a "certain percentage." This likely refers to a percentage increase in interest rates, which is a common tool used by central banks to combat inflation. Lowering prices or having money would not directly address inflation, and "more money" or "have money" are too vague to be appropriate answers.
follow orders | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the soldier must comply with the instructions given by someone with a higher status, which is a common expectation in military structures. Following orders is a fundamental characteristic of military training and discipline, as it ensures that everyone in the chain of command is aligned with the mission and objectives. The other options do not reflect the established norms and expectations of military operations.
rock climbing | Knowledge: The phrase "for outside use" suggests that the suit is designed for activities performed outdoors. Among the choices, the only activity that is most commonly performed outdoors is rock climbing. Verdict and ruling are legal terms, while going to court refers to a legal proceeding rather than an activity or item. Swimming can be performed both indoors and outdoors, so it does not provide enough information to answer the question.
almost anywhere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is so hungry that they are willing to go to any place besides McDonalds. The phrase "almost anywhere" emphasizes the wide range of options that the person is considering. The other options do not provide any additional information that would help in choosing the correct answer.
train station | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person in question is traveling by train and has reached a platform where they need to leave their baggage. Leaving baggage at customs or on an airport carousel are both related to air travel, while leaving baggage on a cruise ship would be related to sea travel. Therefore, the correct answer is train station.
purse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman in question is carrying a train ticket with her, and it would make sense for her to store it in a place that is easily accessible and secure. A purse is a common accessory that women often carry with them, and it can provide a safe and convenient place to store important items such as tickets. The other options do not make sense as logical places to store a ticket, as they are either locations (train depot, ticket booth, ticket office) or a person (conductor's hand) rather than an item that belongs to the woman.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lilly is experiencing a physical sensation as a result of John's actions on her hips and butt. The word "euphoria" might seem like a possible answer, but it is an emotional state rather than a physical one. Hyperthermia refers to overheating of the body and is not related to the context. "Feeling comfortable" and "getting hot" are vague phrases that do not capture the specific sensation described in the sentence, leaving pleasure as the most accurate answer.
go swimming | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the kids are feeling hot and want to cool off. The option "go swimming" is the most logical choice as it is a common activity people do to cool off during hot weather. The other options, such as "manual" and "think", have no clear connection to cooling off. "Relief" and "calm down" may offer some relief from feeling hot, but they do not indicate a specific action the kids would take.
desktop | Knowledge: The question is asking where people have screen savers of sunshine, which suggests that the answer is related to technology. Specifically, screen savers are typically associated with computer desktops, where they activate after a period of inactivity. The other options, such as street or glass, do not have any clear connection to the context of screen savers or sunshine.
make others happy too | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John couldn't physically smile, but he found other ways to make the kids happy. Standing on his head implies he was able to do physical feats that amused the children. The phrase "but he made the kids happy" also suggests that he was doing something to entertain them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
public building | Knowledge: The words "big arched hallway" and "pay your bills or register to vote" suggest that the central passage is a part of a public building. Public buildings often have hallways and are used for administrative purposes like paying bills or registering to vote. The other options like thunderdome, tomb, and arena do not fit in the context of the sentence, while access rooms are not commonly associated with the activities mentioned in the sentence.
desktop | Knowledge: The word "desktop" implies a physical location where the telephone can be placed, such as on a desk or table. The other options do not fit as they are either unrelated (hospital, party, wires) or too broad (hotel).
calm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking someone down can have a positive effect on someone who is angry. The contrast between the strong emotion of anger and the suggested outcome of calmness highlights the calming effect that talking can have on an individual in such a state. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
erections | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that males can have explicit fantasies while sleeping, and this can lead to stiff situations. In context, the word "stiff" likely refers to physical arousal, which is often accompanied by an erection in males. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence; nightmares and dreams may be related to sleep, but they are not related to explicit fantasies, death is a completely unrelated topic, and desires is too general to fit within the sentence's specific language.
demonstration | Knowledge: The context suggests that the speaker did something with the new product for others to see. The word "demonstration" fits this context as it means showing how something works or how to do something. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Hatred" and "desk" are not actions, "shelf" does not involve showing something to others, and "conference" is too general and does not specify what the speaker did with the new product.
wrong | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is religious and has ended their marriage. It implies that ending the marriage may conflict with their religious beliefs and values, which may lead to feelings of guilt or regret. The word "may" suggests that this is a potential outcome, but not a definitive one. The options "depression" and "grief" suggest negative emotions, while "happy" and "relief" suggest positive emotions, but neither accurately capture the potential conflict between religion and divorce. "Wrong" is the best fit as it aligns with the potential conflict and suggests that the person believes they made a mistake in getting divorced.
most families | Knowledge: The sentence implies that living with an uncle is not a typical living arrangement, and that most families do not have this arrangement. Therefore, the correct answer would be "most families." The other options do not have any clear relation to the sentence.
wet suit | Knowledge: Surfing involves being in the water for extended periods of time, and the water can be very cold. A wet suit is a type of clothing designed to keep the surfer warm while they are in the water. The other options are not related to surfing attire.
debt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject frequently spends money that they don't have, which is a behavior that can lead to accumulating debt. The other options do not make sense in the context of overspending and financial irresponsibility.
bearing | Knowledge: A bearing is a mechanical component designed to help reduce friction between moving parts. Bearings often contain a ball or series of balls that allow for smooth movement and efficient operation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of containing a ball for efficient operation.
waterfall | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the moss was slippery due to constant moisture, which suggests that the nearby object was also a source of water. The most likely option is a waterfall, which can generate a lot of moisture and mist around it. The forest, grass, ground, and bridge do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
slavery | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Luke was previously unable to live freely, and was likely forced to work under someone else's control. Slavery is a system in which people are owned by others and forced to work without pay, and matches the description of Luke's previous labor conditions. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place that specialized in sports equipment was the only one of its kind in the town, making it a unique feature. A mall, on the other hand, is often known for having a variety of stores that sell different products, including sports equipment. This would explain why it seemed like the mall had a shop for everything. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
own home | Knowledge: Ferrets are commonly kept as pets, and they require a safe and secure living space. Because they are small and agile animals, they can easily hide in small spaces or crawl into tight corners. Therefore, it is important to provide them with an enclosure that is escape-proof and has plenty of hiding spots. While a ferret could potentially hide in a wood pile, a taxi cab, or even a cousin's house, these locations are not likely to provide the level of safety and security that a ferret needs. Hiding in a fridge could be dangerous and even deadly for a ferret, as they are not equipped to regulate their body temperature in cold environments.
see king | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific reason why the cat is going to the castle and the most logical reason would be to see the king. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or are unlikely reasons for a cat to visit a castle.
gulf states | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Kuwait (and potentially other nearby locations) may not be commonly associated with a certain concept. However, the use of the word "region" implies that this concept is relevant to a specific area. The options "middle east" and "arabia" could also be valid choices, but "gulf states" is a more specific and accurate term for the region in question. "Kuwait" and "Asia" are not broad enough to describe the larger area being referred to in the sentence.
exaggerate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally oversold the features of the homes she sold, which implies that she exaggerated their qualities or features. This behavior likely led to her reputation as a bad real estate agent, as people would have realized that she was not truthful or trustworthy. The other options may be possible, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
deny  | Knowledge: The word "incorrect" suggests that there is an issue with the claim, and the options "forgive," "relinquish," and "give back" do not make sense in this context. "Disown" is not a common action for an insurance adjuster to take, so the most likely answer is "deny." The word "reject" also fits the context and meaning of the sentence, as the adjuster is not accepting or approving the claim.
person | Knowledge: The question is asking about a living being that has blood and parents, which is a characteristic unique to human beings. Blood banks, veins, and capillaries are physical parts of the circulatory system but do not have parents. Hospitals are medical facilities where people go for treatment but do not have blood or parents.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man became tired while working, and then did something to alleviate that fatigue. The word "relax" is the only option that directly relates to this idea. "Sitting down" is too general and could be done for many reasons, while "procrastination" and "stress" are not actions that someone would take in response to feeling tired. "Getting tired" is already established as what happened to the man, so it cannot be the answer.
boat | Knowledge: The question suggests that old models made of wood are being referred to. Of the choices provided, boats are commonly made of wood, particularly older models. While some cars may have had wooden elements, the primary construction material is not typically wood. Trees are living organisms, not man-made models, while hardware stores and lumberyards are not models at all, but rather places where building materials can be purchased.
bus station | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a public space, specifically one that has an outside wall where a map might be displayed for public use. The options "possession" and "suitcase" do not make sense in this context, while "rest area" could potentially have a map, but it is less likely to be displayed on an outside wall. An "atlas" is a book of maps and not typically displayed on an outside wall either.
flat ground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Susan found climbing the slopes difficult, which indicates that she may have preferred a more level terrain. Of the options provided, "flat ground" and "flat" are the most likely choices since they directly address Susan's discomfort with the slope. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
asthma attacks | Knowledge: Asthma is a medical condition that affects the lungs and causes difficulty in breathing. Asthma attacks occur when the airways become inflamed and narrow, making it difficult for air to pass through. This can result in symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. The other options, such as files, living, sustaining life, and giving life, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the question.
avalanches | Knowledge: Heavy snow on a mountain can create unstable conditions and lead to avalanches, which are dangerous and potentially deadly. Shovelling might be necessary to clear paths or driveways, but it doesn't address the potential danger of heavy snow on a mountain. Eating cake and experiencing a blizzard are unrelated to the context of the question.
broom closet | Knowledge: The fact that the spare wooden rod is kept with the cleaning supplies suggests that it is used for cleaning purposes. The most likely place to find cleaning supplies in a household is in a broom closet or utility closet, which is generally where cleaning tools such as brooms, mops, and buckets are stored. The other options - make a hammer, carpentry shop, old clock, old houses - do not relate to cleaning supplies or the use of a wooden rod.
have fun | Knowledge: Releasing fish after catching them is often associated with the practice of "catch and release" fishing, which is done for sport and conservation purposes. Anglers who participate in catch and release fishing often do so to enjoy the experience of fishing without harming the population of fish in a particular body of water. Wet clothes, boredom, and forgetfulness do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, while "catching fish" could be a possible answer but does not fully encompass the motivation to release the fish.
sing songs | Knowledge: Blue birds are known for their melodious songs, which they use to communicate with each other and establish territories. While birds do spread their wings to fly and lay eggs to reproduce, these actions are not specifically associated with blue birds. Similarly, picking berries and screaming are not behaviors that are commonly attributed to blue birds.
sanctuary | Knowledge: The word "altar" is typically associated with religious settings, such as places of worship like temples or churches. The sentence suggests that this specific altar is at risk of vandalism, which implies that it needs to be moved to a safer location. The option "sanctuary" refers to a sacred or safe space within a religious building, making it the most appropriate choice for protecting the altar from potential harm. The other options may not provide adequate protection or may not be relevant to the context.
fall apart | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that an activity may stop because of something happening to things involved in the activity. "Fall apart" is a common phrase used to describe something breaking or falling to pieces, which would likely cause an activity to come to a halt. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathtub | Knowledge: A tap show is a type of dance that involves tapping on hard surfaces with special shoes that have metal plates on the soles. In a bathroom, the floors and walls are made of hard materials like tile or porcelain, which can amplify the sound of tapping. A bathtub, in particular, is a hollow container made of metal or plastic, which makes it an ideal surface for creating loud and resonant tapping sounds. The other options, including water fountains and soda fountains, do not have a solid surface that would produce the same effect. Ohio is a location and not related to the question.
fear | Knowledge: Horror films are typically designed to scare and frighten viewers, so the correct answer is fear. While some people may find horror films entertaining, the primary purpose of the genre is to elicit fear and suspense, making fear the most likely experience for viewers. Laughter and feistiness would be unlikely reactions, while insight is not a typical experience associated with watching a horror film.
good feelings | Knowledge: The word "helping" suggests an action that contributes positively to others or society as a whole. This positive action is likely to generate positive emotions in the person performing it, leading to good feelings. The other options may also be associated with helping, but the particular wording of the question and the context surrounding the word "helping" suggest that good feelings are the most appropriate answer.
in the wild | Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions in the wild, particularly in the northern hemisphere where there are colder climates. Marmots are not typically found near trees or on beaches, as they prefer open, rocky habitats. While there are some species of marmot found in specific regions, such as the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, they are still generally found in the wild rather than in urban or coastal environments.
good health | Knowledge: When someone is getting in shape, it is usually to improve their overall health and wellbeing. Exercise and sweating are important parts of the process, but they are not the ultimate goal. Losing weight and loss of muscle may be a desired outcome for some, but they are not the only aspects of getting in shape. Good health encompasses many factors, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight and body composition.
fatigue | Knowledge: Playing games for an extended period can lead to mental and physical exhaustion, which is commonly referred to as fatigue. It is natural to feel drained or tired after a long gaming session as the brain and body expend a lot of energy while being continually active. The other options, such as happiness or learning, may be experienced during gameplay, but they do not reflect the aftermath of playing games for an extended period.
Netherlands | Knowledge: The presence of canals is a key clue in this question. The Netherlands is known for its extensive network of canals and bike paths, making it a popular destination for cycling tourists. The other options do not have any connection to canals or cycling.
good mood | Knowledge: Smiling and whistling are both typically associated with positive emotions, such as happiness and contentment. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person is likely in a good mood. The options "homes," "greek tragedy," "sad," and "shopping mall" do not provide any information about the person's emotional state.
rocks | Knowledge: Beavers are known for their ability to chew through trees and branches to build their dams and lodges, but they also have strong teeth that can chew through other hard materials like rocks. While beavers are typically found in North America, the options "american forests," "great outdoors," and "Canada" are too broad and not specific enough to be the correct answer. "Pair of pants" is a silly option that is unlikely to be related to beavers' chewing habits.
elective | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the company has a policy regarding retirement contributions, but it is not mandatory like the 8-hour workday. The word "elective" means optional or voluntary, which fits with the sentence's context. The other choices do not align with the idea that retirement contributions are not mandatory. The word "mandate" is the opposite of elective, and the words "optional" and "advisory" suggest that retirement contributions are not required, but they do not convey the idea that it is up to the employee to decide whether or not to make the contributions.
give | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was selfish and took food from potlucks, which implies that he may not have been willing to share or give back. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
football stadium | Knowledge: The word "bleachers" and the use of the word "hooligans" suggest that this is a reference to a rowdy and possibly aggressive crowd at a sporting event. The use of "roared" and "chants" are also strong indicators of a football game, where fans are known to chant and cheer loudly in support of their team. The other options may have cheering fans, but they do not fit the description of a rowdy crowd using smoke bombs and chants.
clear thought | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the act of meditation involves contemplation, which typically refers to thinking deeply and/or focusing one's mind on a specific topic or issue. In this scenario, the goal of meditation is likely to achieve a state of mental clarity, which would involve having clear thoughts and a sense of focus. This option is therefore the best fit among the choices given. The other options do not align with the idea of contemplation or the purpose of meditation.
bird's nest | Knowledge: The sentence mentions seeing a robin, which is a type of bird. The blue egg is likely a reference to a bird's egg, indicating that the speaker is looking for a place where they might find a robin's nest instead of just an egg. A bird's nest is a common place for robins to lay their eggs, so it's the most likely answer. The other options (fridge, plate, yolk, and henhouse) have no clear relevance to the sentence.
talk to himself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a lonely and mentally disturbed person may resort to something for conversation. Of the choices provided, "talk to himself" best fits the context, as it is a common behavior for people experiencing loneliness and mental health issues. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: Cows are commonly found in rural areas or countryside, where there are large open fields or pastures for them to graze on grass. The other options - green field, dry fields, meat grinder, and red barn - are either specific features or objects that do not relate to the context of where cows graze.
big city | Knowledge: Homes and businesses are typically concentrated in urban areas, such as big cities, because of the economic opportunities and access to resources that these areas provide. Nonprofit organizations, zoos, and office buildings may be located in cities, but they are not necessarily associated with a high concentration of homes and businesses. Skyscrapers, on the other hand, are a type of building commonly found in big cities that can house both residential and commercial spaces.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the coworker might ask you for a pen, indicating that you are likely in close proximity to each other. Keeping spares in a pocket would be convenient and easily accessible for both you and the coworker. The other options, such as a friend's house or a briefcase, are not relevant to the context of the sentence, which is focused on the workplace.
punishment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy is disobeying the teacher's orders by leaving the line. In most cases, disobedient behavior in the classroom leads to punishment. Utter chaos and trouble are unlikely outcomes since there's no indication that the boy's behavior is disruptive. Having to start over is an unlikely consequence for leaving the line, and a high five is an inappropriate response to disobedience.
happiness  | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the sick boy was reading letters sent by strangers, which suggests that the letters were likely sent to cheer him up and boost his morale. Since the boy is described as feeling happy while reading the letters, this suggests that they are having a positive impact on him emotionally. The other options (strain, realization, get news, and illness) do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical explanation for why the sick boy would feel happy while reading letters from strangers.
dwelling | Knowledge: The phrase "on the hill" suggests that the hermit's place of living is likely a standalone structure rather than an apartment, hotel, condo, or loft. A dwelling is a general term that encompasses various types of homes, including cabins, cottages, and houses, and it fits the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that the hermit has both a bedroom and kitchen in his dwelling implies that it is a self-sufficient living space.
stairwell | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a vertical structure with a landing at the top that you have to walk up. This matches the description of a stairwell, where stairs lead up to a landing on each floor of a building. The other options, such as the ocean, airport, ladder or an apartment building, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not usually associated with having a landing to walk up at the top.
country club | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James has access to a tennis court that is located in his home, which is a feature commonly associated with country clubs. Country clubs often have tennis courts as part of their facilities, while parks and town centers typically do not have private tennis courts that are accessible from one's home. Michigan and sports do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
appliance store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is shopping for household appliances such as a washer and dryer. Therefore, it is likely that they went to an appliance store which specializes in selling household appliances. The other choices, such as an electronics store, theater or Vegas, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
teach | Knowledge: The word "master" suggests that this question is referring to someone who has achieved a high level of proficiency in a particular trade or craft. The phrase "all skills for a trade" suggests that the answer involves using those skills to provide guidance or instruction to others. The word "teach" is the only option that specifically refers to sharing knowledge and skills with others, whereas the other options either involve enforcing rules (require obedience) or developing one's own understanding of the trade (understand, learn, drill).
geometry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam noticed a shape that was similar to a trapezoid, which is a geometric shape that involves angles, lines, and measurements. Sam may have noticed this because he has an interest or knowledge in geometry, which focuses on studying these shapes and their properties. Architecture may involve geometric principles, but this is not necessarily related to the sentence's context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
worked all day | Knowledge: The phrase "when I have rest" implies that the person was doing something that required a lot of energy or effort before taking a break. The options "took it easy," "feel better," and "exhausted" suggest that the person was already at a state of relaxation or fatigue. "Were very tired" could be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "worked all day," which directly relates to the idea of taking a break after completing a task.
swiss cheese | Knowledge: Swiss cheese is known for its signature holes, which are created during the cheese-making process. The other options do not have any clear connection to the idea of having a hole in them. Cookies, notebook paper, and walls can have holes in them, but it is not a defining characteristic of these items. The ground does not typically have holes in it, unless it has been dug or disturbed in some way.
Maine | Knowledge: Maine is known for its fresh-caught lobster, which is often served in local steakhouses and seafood restaurants. Texas, Michigan, Kansas City, and Ohio are not typically associated with fresh-caught lobster, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
insomnia | Knowledge: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that makes it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep, which would prevent someone from going to bed. Rest, on the other hand, is the act of relaxing or taking a break from activity, which actually encourages going to bed. Getting lost or pregnancy also do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, and making love may or may not prevent someone from going to bed depending on the circumstances.
have fun | Knowledge: Going to play is typically associated with seeking enjoyment and having fun. Children often engage in play to explore, learn, and develop social skills, which are achieved through enjoying themselves in the process. The other options, such as "rush" and "get hungry," are not typically associated with the reasons for play.
full stomach | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that keeping breakfast light is a strategy to avoid a negative consequence when going to work. The most likely consequence of eating too much breakfast would be feeling full, which could make work uncomfortable or even difficult. Indigestion and stomachache are also possible consequences of eating too much, but they are less specific to work situations. Having energy and having a better day are potential benefits of eating breakfast, but they do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
change of color | Knowledge: When a person is dying, their body may go through physical changes such as a change in skin color. This is due to a lack of oxygen circulation and can result in a pale, blue, or mottled appearance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as they either relate to concepts outside the realm of human mortality (ceasing to exist, born again), or use unnecessarily repetitive or overly negative phrasing (no longer exist, would cease to exist).
applause | Knowledge: After a concert, people typically applaud as a form of appreciation for the performance. This is a common practice in the music industry and is a sign of respect for the performers. Smiling and feeling accomplished may also be possible outcomes, but they are not directly related to the question of what happens after a concert. "Medium" and "music" do not make sense in the context of the question.
failure | Knowledge: The question is asking about the biggest fear when opening a business, which implies that there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with this venture. Failure is a common fear for entrepreneurs, as it can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress. Making money and success are desirable outcomes, while too many customers may be challenging but ultimately beneficial for a business. Stress may be a symptom of fear or uncertainty, but it is not directly related to the specific question about opening a business.
catch cold | Knowledge: November is typically associated with cooler weather, and people are more likely to catch a cold or flu during this time. Kissing can spread germs and increase the risk of catching a cold or flu virus, especially if one or both people are already sick. The other options may be possible outcomes of kissing in general, but they do not have a clear connection to the context of November or the potential risk of catching a cold.
better understanding | Knowledge: The question is asking about what typically occurs to the knowledge base of a person who is in the process of learning. The correct answer is likely to be a positive outcome that indicates progress in the learning process. Intelligence and overconfidence may not always necessarily increase as a person learns, while knowing more and growth describe outcomes that are likely to occur when someone is learning new information. However, better understanding strongly suggests that the person is making progress in their comprehension of the subject matter they are studying.
reproduce asexually | Knowledge: The question is asking how plants continue their lineage if they can't move. Reproducing asexually is a common way for plants to create offspring without needing to physically move to a new location. Asexual reproduction can happen through methods like vegetative propagation or budding, where a part of the parent plant grows and develops into a new individual. The other options do not provide a viable way for plants to continue their lineage.
faces | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking through pictures to identify a suspect, which implies that the pictures contained images of people. The use of the word "faces" in the options further reinforces this suggestion. The other options - "person's head," "mammal," "potato," and "someone's face" - are not likely to be relevant in the context of identifying a suspect in pictures.
united states of america | Knowledge: Bald eagles are a well-known symbol of the United States of America and are commonly associated with patriotism and national pride. They appear on the Great Seal of the United States and are often depicted in American art and literature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the bald eagle's symbolism or American culture.
flower pot | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James wanted his anemone (a type of flower) to grow and bloom, which would require proper care and nurturing. Placing the flower in a flower pot would be a common way to do this, as it provides a stable environment with soil and nutrients for the plant to grow. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not conducive to growing flowers.
everything | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the siblings fought often, which implies that they had a lot of disagreements. The phrase "had to make a rule for every" indicates that the mother was frequently creating rules to try to control the fighting. This would likely include rules for a wide range of topics, hence the choice of "everything" as the correct answer. The other options do not fit as well, as they are either too specific (text book, lawbook) or not directly related to the context (family situation, dinner time).
turbine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described captures the air and uses it to create power. This is a characteristic commonly associated with a turbine, which is a type of engine that converts the energy from a moving fluid (such as air or water) into mechanical energy. The other options do not fit the description of an object that uses wind or air to create power.
closing eyes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to the act of preparing to sleep. The last thing most people do before they sleep is to close their eyes, which is a necessary step towards falling asleep. The other options, such as being an animal or doing somersaults, do not have a clear connection to the context and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
meeting friends | Knowledge: The question is asking for another activity besides shopping that can be done at malls. Meeting friends is a common social activity that takes place at malls, as people often gather to socialize, grab a meal, or see a movie. While the other choices are related to shopping, they do not provide an alternative activity to shopping.
sweating | Knowledge: Sweating is a common physiological response to exercise, as it helps regulate body temperature and prevent overheating. While exercise may increase the body's need for food and water, and can potentially lead to injuries, sweating is a more direct and specific answer to the question. "Work out" is not really a physiological response, but rather a description of the activity being performed.
celebrating | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the team is about to win a baseball game. In such situations, the team would typically celebrate their impending victory. Celebration might involve high-fives, group hugs, cheers, and so on. Pride and recognition are less likely options, because the team may not necessarily be recognized or feel proud until after they have won. Joy is a possibility, but it is not specific enough to the context of a baseball game. Going home is an irrelevant option that does not make sense in the given sentence.
get divorced | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple decided to end their marriage, which is commonly referred to as getting a divorce. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as being lonely or arguing does not indicate a decision to end the marriage, legal fees do not make sense in the context, and pleasure does not relate to the topic of divorce.
wine | Knowledge: In French cuisine, serving wine with dinner is a common practice and forms an important part of the dining experience. Wine complements the flavors of the food and helps to enhance the overall dining experience. The other options, such as Montreal, Quebec, Manhattan, and potpourri, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question nor are they typically served with dinner at a French restaurant.
hold up | Knowledge: The use of the word "knotted" suggests that there was an issue with her hair or something else that was flowing, and the solution was to put up the convertible's top. The phrase "next time" implies that this was a recurring event or something that she had experienced before. "Hold up" is the most appropriate phrase to describe the act of stopping or pausing briefly in order to address an issue, while the other options do not fit the context or meaning of the sentence. "Stagnate" and "stagnant" are similar in meaning and describe something that is not moving or progressing, but they do not relate to the specific scenario described in the sentence. "Unmoved" and "stopping" do not capture the meaning of addressing an issue, and are therefore less appropriate answers.
talk to god | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common action associated with prayer. Talking to God is a common way that people pray, as prayer is often thought of as a way to communicate with a higher power. The other options may also be associated with prayer, but they do not directly address the question being asked.
writer's cramp | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that writing can cause a negative physical effect before it is finished. Writer's cramp is a condition that causes pain and stiffness in the hand and wrist due to the repetitive motion of writing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
New York | Knowledge: The question is asking which state does not share a border with Colorado, so one can eliminate options that do border Colorado. Colorado does share borders with the United States (since it is located within the US), Texas, Mexico, and Nevada. New York is located in the northeastern part of the US and is far away from Colorado, so it does not share a border with the state.
liked | Knowledge: To "entertain" someone typically means to engage with them in a fun or enjoyable way, such as by hosting them at a party or making them laugh with jokes or stories. Therefore, if someone entertains another person, it is likely that the other person will feel positively toward them. "Liked" is the best answer choice as it directly describes a positive feeling toward the person who is doing the entertaining. The other answer choices may also describe positive feelings, but they are not specifically connected to the activity of entertaining.
medical school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the doctor must obtain some form of training before practicing. Medical schools are institutions that specifically train individuals to become medical doctors, providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to practice medicine. The other options do not offer any form of medical training, making them unlikely answers.
stores | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the shopping center was lacking tenants, which suggests that they were looking for businesses to fill the space. The most likely option in the given choices is "stores" as it specifically refers to businesses. "People" is too general and could refer to customers, employees, or potential investors. "Most peculiar places" is an odd option that doesn't fit the context of the sentence. "Mall" is synonymous with shopping center and doesn't provide any additional information. "Suburbs" is irrelevant to the question, as it doesn't specify who the shopping center solicited.
flatulence | Knowledge: Beans are known for causing gas and flatulence in some people due to a type of carbohydrate they contain called oligosaccharides. This is a commonly known result of eating beans and is referenced in popular culture and literature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
one head | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a body part located on top of the neck, which is a clear indicator that the correct answer is "one head." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
resentment | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the laid off factory worker had a negative reaction to hearing about a changing society. Out of the given choices, anger, resentment, and depression can all be considered negative emotions. However, resentment specifically suggests a feeling of bitterness or indignation towards the situation, which seems to fit the context of the sentence better than anger or depression. "Make person sick" and acceptance do not match the tone of the sentence.
mountainous area | Knowledge: The question mentions a sunny, clear day, which suggests that the answer is not a location that would typically have rough or turbulent water. A bridge and waterfall are unlikely options as the water would be moving too fast or be rough. Planet earth and valley are too broad and do not provide any specific information. A mountainous area may have calm pools or slow-moving rivers, making it an ideal location for holding a cup upright to catch water on a sunny, clear day.
gathering of information | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the spy was listening in on a conversation, which suggests that their purpose was to gather information. Gathering information is often a common objective for spies, as they seek to obtain intel on their targets. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and do not have any clear connection to spying.
illuminate  | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about the role of light in illuminating the air. Light is often used to illuminate spaces or objects, and when it passes through the air, it can help to illuminate the surrounding area. The other options (beam, polarised, carry information, and age paper) do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not relevant answers.
church | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the building is occupied on a specific day, the day after Saturday, which is commonly known as Sunday, and therefore could be a religious building. The mention of a basement also points towards a larger building, which could also support the idea of it being a church. The other options, such as a closet or own house, do not fit the criteria mentioned in the sentence.
home | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the shopping bag is being used to carry items that have been purchased while out shopping. After shopping, one would typically take the bag home with them. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
drink coffee | Knowledge: While it is possible that some people may experience aggravation while reading the news, it is not a common behavior. Looking at pictures is also not a typical action people take while reading the newspaper, as most news articles are predominantly text-based. Eating breakfast and drinking coffee, on the other hand, are commonly associated with reading the newspaper as many people enjoy consuming breakfast items and hot beverages while perusing current events. Chugging milk is not a common behavior associated with reading the newspaper.
go to movies | Knowledge: The phrase "see a story on the big screen" suggests that the question is asking about watching a movie. "Go to movies" is the only answer choice that directly relates to this idea, as it implies physically going to a movie theater to watch a film. The other choices, such as "visualize," "reading," "open book," and "sketching a picture," do not have any connection to watching a movie.
different states | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the food show focused on pizzas and traveled to different locations to visit a pizzeria each week. Therefore, the correct answer would be "different states". "Chicago", "Little Italy", and "New York" are all specific locations, but the sentence states that the show visited different places each week. "Friends house" does not relate to the context of the sentence, and "capital cities" is too general and not specific enough to the topic of pizzas.
pantry | Knowledge: The word "walk-in" suggests that the family got their food from a room or closet designated specifically for storing food, such as a pantry. A pantry is typically used to store non-perishable items like bread and chips, making this a likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well: a supermarket is a large store, a plastic bag would not be referred to as a "walk-in," a toaster is an appliance for cooking food rather than storing it, and a house is too general to provide a clear answer in this context.
election | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a president is a result of a process or event. Of the choices given, "election" is the most likely option since presidents are typically elected by the people they govern. "Board room" and "self-appointed" are not commonly associated with the selection of presidents and "trouble" is vague and not a valid option. While "government" may seem like a plausible answer, it is not specific enough to answer the question accurately.
being single | Knowledge: After getting a divorce, a person's marital status changes from being married to being single. Therefore, the correct answer is "being single." The other options are not accurate descriptions of a person's relationship status after a divorce. "Children suffer" and "freedom" may be associated with divorce, but they do not relate to the question about relationship status. "Default setting" and "no spouse" are not commonly used phrases to describe a person's relationship status.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Yooperland, which is a colloquial term for Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Additionally, the mention of train tracks suggests that the character is traveling within the state rather than to a different location like New York or Canada. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
wash dishes  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having children wash dishes after dinner is a way to teach them responsibility. Washing dishes is a household chore that requires attention to detail, good time management, and the ability to work independently, making it a useful task for teaching responsibility. None of the other options have a clear connection to the concept of responsibility or household chores.
black | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person wants a dog that's easy to spot, which suggests that they are looking for a dog with a distinctive appearance. Among the given choices, "black" is the only option that can refer to a physical characteristic that is easily recognizable. The other choices ("blind", "fun", "alive", "playing dead") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
main street | Knowledge: Main streets are often the busiest areas in towns and cities where people gather to shop, eat, and socialize. By setting up on a main street, the dentist's office would be more visible to potential patients as they pass by on foot or in their cars. Corner stores and medical centers may also be good options for visibility, but the sentence specifically mentions wanting to stand out from other medical offices. Metropolitan cities would have high visibility, but there may be more competition and higher costs associated with such a location. Towns may not have as much foot traffic or visibility as main streets or metropolitan areas.
grocery store | Knowledge: The items mentioned - macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper - are all food products typically found in a grocery store. The other options do not sell food products, making them unlikely choices for where John would be shopping for these items.
needle | Knowledge: A needle is often used to draw blood or give injections, which could cause a drop of blood to fall. The other options, such as human body, vein, and person, are too general and do not provide a specific action or object that could cause a drop of blood to fall. A bite could cause bleeding, but it is not as common or specific as a needle in the context of the question.
concentrate | Knowledge: When someone studies in a library, they often need to focus and pay attention to their work in order to be productive. This requires a level of concentration. The other choices are related to the act of studying in a library, but do not directly answer the question of what one is about to do when studying in a library.
girl's hair | Knowledge: A ribbon is commonly used as a decorative accessory in hair styling. Mothers often put ribbons on their daughters' hair to make them look more attractive or to keep their hair in place. The other options, such as a typewriter or floral arrangement, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
getting higher | Knowledge: Climbing a mountain involves ascending to higher elevations, which is the most logical answer to the question. The other choices may be potential outcomes of climbing a mountain, but they are not directly related to the act of climbing itself.
worsened | Knowledge: The word "soured" implies that something that was once good has now become unpleasant or undesirable. This suggests that James believed that the situation had declined or worsened in some way. The other options do not necessarily convey the sense of deterioration or worsening that is implied by the word "soured."
reproduction | Knowledge: The question is asking for an alternative to an original painting that is more affordable. Reproduction is a term commonly used to describe a copy of a painting that is made by printing or copying the original artwork. The other options, such as derivative or simile, are not typically used to describe a copy or alternative to an original painting.
cheat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who is immoral may resort to unethical behavior during final exams, such as cheating. The option "study" is the opposite of what someone who didn't study would do. "Great joy" and "graduation" are not related to the context of the sentence, while "sweat" is a normal bodily response to stress and not necessarily indicative of immoral behavior.
drugstore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob needs to replace his sunglasses quickly, which implies that he does not have time to search in large stores like department stores or look through his car. The most convenient option would be a drugstore, which typically sells a variety of inexpensive sunglasses and is likely to be located nearby. The other options listed do not offer a clear solution to Bob's problem of quickly getting new sunglasses.
spend more | Knowledge: Inflation refers to the increase in prices over time, which means that people need to spend more money to purchase the same goods and services. Therefore, when people are fighting inflation, they should stop spending more money and try to reduce their expenses. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Problems, economic instability, and deflation are not actions that people can do to fight inflation, while buying liquor may be a way to temporarily forget about the issue but not a solution to it.
using gas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving is expensive for Bill due to the cost of gas. Therefore, the correct answer would be "using gas." The other options are not directly related to the expense of driving, such as deaths, traffic jams, and break down. "May die" is also not a logical answer as it is not related to the context of the sentence.
kitchen | Knowledge: A dish cloth is commonly used in the kitchen to clean dishes and surfaces, so it makes sense to keep it where it is most accessible. The other options (laundry, linen closet, fabric store, bedroom) are not relevant as they do not have any connection to the use of a dish cloth in the home.
set table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the waiter is performing a task that occurs between each customer, which could be setting the table for the next guests. Serving the meal and serving the food are tasks that are typically performed while the customers are present, while presenting the bill and taking the order are tasks performed at the beginning or end of the meal. Therefore, setting the table is the most likely answer.
Christmas tree | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the poor family does not have any decorations in December, which implies that they do not have a Christmas tree. A Christmas tree is a common decoration during the holiday season and is often the centerpiece of many homes' holiday décor. The other choices either do not have a clear connection to the context or do not address the issue of the family's lack of decorations during the holiday season.
full | Knowledge: The act of peeing involves emptying the bladder, so if a person has the urge to pee, it likely means their bladder is full. The other options do not accurately describe the state of the bladder in this context.
hostility | Knowledge: The word "ignorance" implies a lack of understanding or knowledge, and when this exists between groups, it can lead to conflict or hostility. This is a common theme in social psychology and intergroup relations research, which has shown that intergroup ignorance often leads to negative perceptions, stereotypes, and prejudice. The other options do not make logical sense in this context, as they do not reflect the negative consequences of intergroup ignorance.
entertaining | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing games with children has a certain effect on them, and the key to choosing the correct answer is to identify what that effect might be. The other options are either inappropriate, negative, or do not fit the context of the sentence. The correct answer is "entertaining" because playing games with children is an activity that is designed to be fun and enjoyable for both the children and the adults involved. Playing games can help to stimulate their creativity, encourage socialization, and promote friendship and teamwork.
go home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person fishing did not catch any fish, which could imply that they were unsuccessful in their attempt to catch food. Therefore, "getting food" and "eating fish" are not likely answers. "Getting drunk" and "anger" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence either. The most reasonable option is that they would go home since they were not successful in their fishing trip.
radio station | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about where radio studios can be found. The most likely place for radio studios to be concentrated in one area is at a radio station, where multiple programs are broadcasted from a central location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
more comfortable | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was feeling cold and getting an extra blanket would hopefully help them become more comfortable. The phrase "more comfortable" directly relates to the action of getting an extra blanket, whereas the other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Were cold" is grammatically incorrect, "you're cold" is not a relevant option as it addresses the reader directly, and "less cold" and "feel comfortable" are opposite in meaning to the intended outcome.
have food | Knowledge: Hunger is an indication that the body needs food for energy. Drinking water may hydrate the body but will not satisfy hunger. Cooking dinner or having lunch may not be feasible or necessary in the middle of the night. Eating a hamburger is a specific food choice and may not be available or appropriate for everyone. Having food is a general option that acknowledges the need to eat something to alleviate hunger.
call friends or learn from each other | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people engage in some activity to alleviate their boredom. Calling friends or learning from each other are both common ways people may choose to do this. Eating fish or dying of starvation do not relate to the context of the sentence, and while writing stories may be a potential activity, it is not mentioned as a specific option in the sentence.
past | Knowledge: The use of the past tense verb "used" indicates that the action of using the travel website to book flights has already taken place. The sentence suggests that the speaker has a regular habit of using this website in the past. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either refer to the present or have no clear connection to the action being described.
birth | Knowledge: The word "reproducing" suggests that the farmer was breeding or producing more sheep. The question asks about what one particular sheep gave later, which implies that it gave birth to lambs. The choice "wool" is related to sheep, but does not fit the context of reproduction. "Fun" and "larger family" are unlikely outcomes of sheep reproduction, while "problems" is a negative option that is not supported by any context in the sentence.
llano estacado | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person was "bound" for llano estacado, which means that it was his intended destination or end goal. The other options are possible nearby locations to llano estacado, but there is no clear indication that any of them are the end goal mentioned in the sentence.
mute | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is unable to reply to you, which indicates that they are unable to speak. The term "mute" specifically refers to someone who is unable to speak, while "deaf" refers to someone who is unable to hear. The other options, such as "send" and "email," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
clinic | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people mentioned don't have insurance and are therefore seeking medical care at a place that is likely to have a long wait time. Clinics are often associated with longer wait times and take walk-ins without appointments, unlike private doctors who often require appointments and may have shorter wait times. Maternity wards are not typically walk-in clinics, and their services are highly specialized, while a dentist's office is also unlikely to be a walk-in clinic and provides specialized care for dental issues. A doctor's office could be a walk-in clinic but may also require appointments and offer a wider range of services than a typical clinic.
cup of coffee | Knowledge: Pouring water over grounds is a common way to make coffee. Coffee grounds are typically placed in a filter or French press, and hot water is poured over them to extract the flavor. The other options are not related to making a drink using water and grounds.
person's head | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair being referred to is that of humans, and the most common location for human hair is on a person's head. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. While mammals do have hair, including humans, the sentence specifies "human hair" and not "mammal hair." The options "legs" and "arm" may have hair, but this is not a characteristic commonly associated with those body parts. "Sink" is not a location for hair, but rather a place where hair might be removed or disposed of.
fleas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog's behavior was caused by an external factor. Antsy and restless behavior is often associated with discomfort, which may be caused by fleas. Fleas are a common parasite in dogs that can cause itching and discomfort, leading to restless behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the library is accessible to people of any age, which is a common feature of libraries in educational institutions like schools and colleges. Libraries in houses are usually personal collections and not open to the public, while libraries downtown or inside buildings may have age restrictions or require membership to access.
come back | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog was in danger of getting hit by a car in the street, and the person yelled at the dog to do something to avoid that danger. "Come back" is the most appropriate choice because it implies returning to a safer location, while the other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Come here" and "being here" are not related to the danger and do not indicate a specific direction. "Home team" and "available" have no relation to the context at all.
irritation | Knowledge: The question implies that the person answering the questions is deliberately providing incorrect answers, which can be frustrating and annoying for the listener. The word "incorrectly" suggests that the person may be misleading or misleading the listener, leading to confusion and irritation. The other options do not accurately reflect the negative emotions that can arise from such a situation.
go to sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dreaming is something that happens during sleep, so the correct answer is likely to involve the process of falling asleep. Out of the options given, only "go to sleep" and "fall asleep" accurately describe the act of getting into a sleeping state. "Sleep peacefully" might be a helpful step towards having pleasant dreams, but it is not a prerequisite for dreaming itself. "Smoke pot" is not a necessary or advisable step for dreaming, and "set goals" is not related to the physical process of falling asleep.
istanbul | Knowledge: The word "bazaar" is commonly associated with the Middle Eastern region, and Istanbul is known for its famous Grand Bazaar. While other regions on the list may have their own marketplaces or festivals, Istanbul is the most commonly associated with a famous bazaar.
picture book | Knowledge: The question suggests that the sloth mentioned only exists in the imagination or as a mental image. This implies that it would likely be seen in a picture book or other forms of illustrations. The other options, such as a bad dream, another place, universe or rainforest, do not have a direct association with seeing an imaginary sloth in your head.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going on vacation will evoke a certain emotion or feeling. The word "vacation" is often associated with taking a break from work or stress and relaxing, so it makes sense that the correct answer would be "relaxation." The other options do not align with the common associations of going on vacation, as overspending and staying there reflect more negative aspects, pie seems unrelated, and "pleasant thoughts" is too vague to be a clear choice.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to eat BBQ that is not at home. The options "backyard" and "neighbor's house" would not be suitable because they are both places where someone would typically have a BBQ meal at home. "Louisiana" is a state known for its BBQ, but it does not provide information on where to get a BBQ meal away from home. "Ribs" refers to a type of BBQ meat but does not offer any location information. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "restaurant" as it is a place one can go to get a BBQ meal away from home.
head | Knowledge: Storing personal knowledge in the head is the most practical and common way to do so. Unlike the other options provided that require physical storage, the human mind is capable of retaining vast amounts of information and knowledge. Encyclopedias and books may contain valuable information but require access to physical specimens. University education can provide knowledge, but it is ultimately up to the individual to store it in their head. A safe is only useful for storing physical items, not intangible knowledge.
office building | Knowledge: The presence of guards checking IDs at the entryway suggests that the building is likely a secure location, such as an office building or government facility, rather than a department store or private residence. While it is possible that some high-end department stores may have security measures in place, this would be less common than in buildings and facilities where access control is a higher priority. The option about picking tomatoes from a garden is also unlikely since this activity would not typically require ID checks or security personnel.
learn to speak | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baby was able to hear his mom talking for months, which means that he was exposed to language during that time. Based on this, it is likely that the baby would have picked up some language skills and learned how to speak, making "learn to speak" the correct answer. The other options, such as "talk nonsense" or "talk rubbish," do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make sense given the situation. "Boy or girl" is also not a relevant option as it does not relate to the sentence at all.
meeting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there was a task or requirement that the staff needed to attend to before the party. While some of the other options may be activities that the staff could do, they do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Ocean," "studying," and "stay home" are too vague and have no clear connection to the sentence. "Celebrating birthday" may be an option, but it would not make sense for the staff to attend this before the party. Therefore, "meeting" is the most likely answer as it fits with the idea of needing to attend to a task before the party.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is watching a performance from a high vantage point, which is commonly found in a theatre. The sentence also mentions rehearsed lines and an audience, which are both associated with theatrical performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
England | Knowledge: The question describes a place that has a queen who is not an insect, implying that it is a monarchy with a female ruler. England is a well-known example of a country with a queen who is not an insect, as Queen Elizabeth II is the current reigning monarch. The other options - castle, bee hive, and palace - do not fit the description of a place with a female ruler who is not an insect.
healthy | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Johnny had a disease that prevented him from playing with friends, which implies that he was not healthy. His family's goal, therefore, would be for him to become healthy so that he could resume normal activities. "Wellness" is a related concept, but it does not specifically address Johnny's health status. "Passing around" and "infect" are not goals that anyone would desire in this context. "Cure" is a related goal, but it implies that there is a specific treatment for Johnny's disease, which may not be the case.
motorcycle | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a type of bike that has an engine, which rules out options like lawnmower, bicycle and car, as they are not typically associated with engines. The correct answer, motorcycle, is a specific type of bike that is designed to be powered by an engine. The option automobile is a common type of vehicle, but it is not typically referred to as a bike.
getting tired | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has been driving for a long time, which is a tiring activity. The phrase "sick of driving" suggests that they may be feeling exhausted or fatigued, which is reflected in the choice "getting tired." The other options do not fit in the context of the sentence.
garden of eden | Knowledge: The question is framed as a hypothetical scenario, where the person asking the question imagines themselves as a snake. The phrase "go tempt people" suggests that the snake would be looking to deceive or mislead individuals. In this context, the Garden of Eden is a reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve, where a serpent tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, leading to their expulsion from the garden. Therefore, the most logical answer would be the Garden of Eden, as it is a well-known location associated with temptation and deception. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
motel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are on vacation and have access to a swimming pool that they can enjoy before bedtime. While it is possible to find swimming pools in other locations, such as fitness centers and schools, the context of the sentence implies that the swimming pool is located in a place where people stay during their holiday. A motel is a type of lodging commonly associated with vacation travelers and is therefore the best answer choice. California is a state and not a specific location, and "on the street" does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
business man | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a modern farmer needs to possess business skills in order to manage finances and increase sales. This implies that the skills needed are similar to those of a business man. Harvesting is a specific task related to farming, but does not relate to managing finances or increasing sales. City dwellers and industrial businesses do not have any clear relation to farming. Farm land is a generic term for the land used in farming, but it does not provide any insight into the skills needed to manage finances and increase sales.
kiss each other | Knowledge: The question asks what happens when lovers want to show affection, which suggests a positive action. "Kiss each other" is the only option that fits this requirement. "Show disgust of each other" and "argue" are negative actions that would not be associated with showing affection. "Part ways" and "break up" suggest the end of a relationship, which is also not associated with showing affection.
sink | Knowledge: The question is asking for a way to wet a washcloth without squatting down, implying that the person does not want to use a lower surface like a bathtub or floor. The kitchen is not necessarily a bad option, but it does not provide a specific solution to the problem. The linen closet and swimming pool are not related to the context of the question at all. This leaves the sink as the most likely and logical option for wetting a washcloth while standing upright.
get somewhere | Knowledge: The question is asking about the reason why someone would decide to go somewhere. Of the given options, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable answer as it directly answers the question. "Might drive car" is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear reason for deciding to go somewhere. "Stumbling down" and "boredom" are unlikely reasons for making a deliberate decision to go somewhere. "Have fun" could be a reason to go somewhere, but it is not general enough to be considered the correct answer.
introduce yourself | Knowledge: When meeting people for the first time, it is customary to introduce yourself, providing your name and perhaps some basic information about who you are and what you do. This helps to establish a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, which the other options also suggest. However, smiling and saying a greeting are not sufficient on their own and may be perceived as insincere or awkward. Looking over could also be interpreted as rude or dismissive.
financially unable | Knowledge: The phrase "bringing suit" refers to initiating a legal action, which often involves paying legal fees and other related expenses. Therefore, it would make sense that someone may be unable to bring suit if they are financially unable to cover the associated costs. The other options, such as "aggravation" or "randomness," do not provide an explanation as to why someone would be unable to bring suit.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence mentions picking up one more thing off his list and filling his cart, which suggests that the person is in a store. Additionally, grabbing some coffee on the way to checking out is a common activity in grocery stores. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
old movie | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "dime store" suggests that the context is from a bygone era when such stores were more common. Additionally, the fact that the characters are wearing hats implies that the movie is set in a time period when hats were more commonly worn. Therefore, the most likely option is an old movie, which would have been filmed in a time when dime stores were still prevalent and hats were a common fashion accessory. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
produce products | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to the purpose of having multiple machines. Since machines are commonly used in manufacturing, the most likely reason for a manufacturer to have many machines is to produce products on a larger scale. The other options are not related to the context of manufacturing, and therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
headache | Knowledge: The sentence implies that going to the opera would be uncomfortable due to a painful condition. The option "fall asleep" doesn't fit because falling asleep would not necessarily be painful. "Haircut" and "fresh" don't make sense in this context. "Relaxation" is the opposite of discomfort. Therefore, "headache" is the only option that connects with the idea of pain and would make going to the opera uncomfortable.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "liquid food" which suggests that it can be stored in a container. The options "supermarket", "oven", and "plate" do not make sense as places to store liquid food. "Pantry" could be a possible option, but it is not specific enough as it is a general storage area in a house. "Jar" is the most appropriate option as it is a common container used to store liquids, such as sauces, jams, and pickles.
birthday party | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker needs a balloon for decoration purposes, which is often associated with events such as birthday parties. Balloons are commonly used as decorations at parties, especially for children's birthday parties. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
verbal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in the sentence is deciding to express their opinion about a written assignment that the students found unfair. The word "verbal" refers to spoken communication, which makes the most sense in this context. The other options do not accurately capture the mode of communication being used to express the person's opinion about the assignment.
sewer | Knowledge: The term "water run-off overflow" suggests that excess water is flowing out of a particular area, such as a street or building, after heavy rain or flooding. The most likely destination for this water is a sewer system, as it is designed to handle excess water and prevent flooding. The other options, such as bathroom, glass, drain, and behind the curtain, do not make sense in the context of water run-off overflow.
get arrested | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that buying too much beer can have negative consequences that can lead to getting arrested. Intoxication and boredom are possible outcomes of drinking too much beer, but they do not necessarily involve legal consequences. Problems may be vague and not directly related to the act of buying beer. Pleasure is too positive and does not make sense in the context of negative consequences. Therefore, get arrested is the only reasonable choice.
labyrinth | Knowledge: A labyrinth is a specific type of maze-like structure that is designed for walking meditation or spiritual reflection. The other options (store, city, diary, bible) do not typically involve physical walking, with the exception of potentially walking through a city if sightseeing or exploring, but this is not explicitly stated in the question. Therefore, the correct answer must be the option that most clearly relates to physical movement or walking, which is labyrinth.
go somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is feeling excitement and a desire to leave the house. The best option to satisfy both of these conditions is to go somewhere else. The other choices do not necessarily involve leaving the house or may not provide the same level of excitement as going somewhere new. For example, expressing information or going to the gym may not fulfill the desire for adventure and novelty that is suggested in the sentence.
content | Knowledge: The phrase "wisely decided to cash in" suggests that the person made a smart decision to stop gambling and collect their winnings. The phrase "brought a smile of content" implies that the person was satisfied with their decision and felt content with their winnings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James and Jane were enjoying themselves, which typically results in positive emotions such as happiness. The options "stress relief" and "laughter" are also possible outcomes, but "may laugh" and "in hospital" seem irrelevant and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
montana | Knowledge: The name "Big Sky Excavation" suggests that the company operates in an area with a large sky, such as a wide open space. Montana, known as "Big Sky Country," is a state characterized by open landscapes and wide expanses of sky, making it the most likely location for a company with this name. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the company's name.
spillage | Knowledge: The question suggests that there may be a consequence of not being careful when setting a cup on a table. The most likely consequence would be spillage, as a cup that is not set down carefully could tip over and spill its contents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
skate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe enjoys skating and finds it calming and Zen. He is able to feel the wind while skating, which indicates that he is likely outdoors and on skates. The other options, such as increased heart rate, injury, might fall, run, and move fast, do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence or the idea of skating being calming and Zen.
alimentary canal | Knowledge: The sentence is describing the pathway that food takes through the body, starting in the mouth and passing through the throat. The alimentary canal, which includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines, is the the pathway that food travels through the body during digestion. The other options are not related to the digestive system and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
office supply store | Knowledge: The other options listed do not typically sell pens, while an office supply store specifically specializes in selling writing instruments such as pens. Additionally, the context of the question suggests that the person is looking to purchase a pen for writing purposes, which further supports the idea that an office supply store would be the correct answer.
play sports | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the children are wearing uniforms and helmets, which are commonly associated with sports activities. Additionally, the verb "about to do" implies that the children are in the process of starting an activity, rather than throwing things or playing with toys. The other options do not fit the given context.
snow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a chess set was left outside and is at risk of freezing, which is most likely to occur in a location with cold weather. Michigan is a state known for having cold winters, which may suggest it as a possible answer. A dorm or cupboard are enclosed spaces unlikely to be exposed to freezing temperatures. A toy store is an unlikely location for a chess set to be left outside. Snow is the most likely answer as it is a weather condition associated with cold temperatures and can freeze objects left outside.
salon | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that clippers are used on women at a specific location. While barbershops are typically associated with men getting their hair cut, women may also go to a barbershop for a short haircut or shave. However, the term "salon" is more commonly used to refer to a place where males and females can get haircuts and other beauty treatments. The other options, such as pharmacy or bathroom cabinet, are not places where haircuts are typically performed.
fishing boat | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that we are talking about a commercial activity involving the capture of crabs, which is typically done using fishing boats. Tidepools are not large enough to support commercial crab fishing, and cruise ships and Seychelles are not related to crab fishing at all. Underpants is a humorous option that is clearly incorrect.
hospital | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the person were to experience a sudden illness, they should go somewhere. Nursing homes and elderly persons are not typically equipped to handle sudden illnesses, nor are buildings or the brain. A hospital, however, has the resources and healthcare professionals necessary to provide treatment for a sudden illness.
queue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was printing when the paper got jammed, and after fixing the issue, he had to clear something. It is likely that he had to clear the print queue, which is a list of printing tasks that are waiting to be completed. When a paper jam occurs, the printer may pause its operation and stop printing any additional documents until the issue is resolved. Once the problem is fixed, the printer may resume printing the remaining items in the queue, and James may need to clear the queue to ensure that his current print job is prioritized. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pink | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that this is a gender reveal party for a baby girl, and traditionally the color associated with females is pink. The sentence also specifically mentions that flower bouquets were colored in a certain way, which further supports this notion. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
amusement park | Knowledge: Ticket booths are commonly found at amusement parks where visitors purchase tickets or wristbands to ride attractions. Train stations and metro stations also have ticket booths, but their purpose is to purchase tickets for transportation rather than rides. Fairgrounds may have ticket booths for admission to the fair, but not specifically for rides. Museums usually have ticket booths for admission, but they do not have rides.
laugh | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that if someone's favorite show is a comedy, they will likely find it funny and laugh. This is a common reaction to humorous content. The other options may not be relevant or appropriate in this context.
suitcase | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is preparing for a trip and has packed their toothpaste and brush along with their clothes. The appropriate item to store these belongings would be a suitcase, as it is a common travel accessory specifically designed for packing and transporting personal items. The other options, such as bathroom or drug store, are unrelated to the context of the sentence. Mouth and squirrel are also irrelevant and do not make logical sense as the answer.
restaurant | Knowledge: Popcorn is a popular snack often associated with venues such as movie theaters, carnivals, and sports events. While some restaurants may serve popcorn, it is not typically found on their menus or offered as a common snack option. Therefore, it is unlikely that one would find popcorn in a restaurant.
tide pool | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crab was separated from his fellow crabs while out in the sea, which implies that he was likely to be in a natural habitat where crabs gather. Tide pools are shallow, rocky pools filled with seawater that are home to many different sea creatures, including crabs. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a crab would not be found in a fish market or cooking pot, and a farm is located on land.
victory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was unable to achieve something despite his efforts to defeat John, and the context implies that this something is related to success in a competition or battle. The word "victory" is most closely associated with success in a competition or battle, and therefore the correct answer. The other options may be related to success in other contexts, but are not clearly indicated by the sentence.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the discovery of the truth about her father had led to a specific emotional reaction. The word "discovering" suggests that she had been searching for this information, which implies some sort of emotional burden or uncertainty that may have been lifted when she found out the truth. The word "relief" connotes a lifting of this burden and is therefore the best match for the context of the sentence. The other options do not have a clear connection to the idea of discovering the truth.
pocket | Knowledge: Since the question refers to not having anything specifically designed to hold a dollar bill, it suggests that the individual may not have a wallet, billfold, or purse on them. Therefore, the next logical option would be to carry the dollar bill in their pocket. Additionally, pockets are a common and convenient place to store smaller items like loose change and bills. The bank option is unlikely since it is a financial institution and not a place to store physical currency.
tied up | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the woman used a drawstring bag, which typically has a simple mechanism for closure, involving pulling a cord to close the opening. Therefore, it can be inferred that the woman wanted her belongings to be tied up securely in the bag, to prevent them from falling out or getting lost. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or do not offer a logical connection to drawstring bags.
Maine | Knowledge: The sentence specifies that the bald eagle is at the northern extreme of the continental United States, which narrows down the possible locations to states that are bordering Canada. Of the given choices, Maine is the state that is located furthest north and closest to the Canadian border, making it the most likely answer. The other options may be located in the United States, but they do not have the same geographical location as Maine.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the leaves are in a location where they may be a hazard to drivers or pedestrians. Out of the given choices, a street is the most likely place where leaves could cause an accident due to slipping or reduced visibility, particularly during wet or icy conditions. The other options do not have a clear connection to this context.
feel full | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a lot of food will cause a specific sensation in someone, which is most likely to be feeling full. This is a common sensation that people experience after consuming a large amount of food. The other options do not accurately reflect the sensation of having a lot of food, as feeling satisfied or having heavy food are not necessarily connected to the quantity of food consumed, becoming tired does not relate to food consumption, and digestion is a process rather than a sensation.
accidental | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John did not intend for the oil spill to occur, indicating that it was an accident. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Detestable" and "weird" are subjective opinions that do not relate to the cause of the oil spill. "Enabled" and "effusive" suggest intention or enthusiasm, which contradicts the idea that the incident was accidental.
exercise | Knowledge: Hiking is often considered a form of exercise, as it involves walking on varied terrain and can provide cardiovascular and muscular benefits. While it can also be a way to seek adventure and challenge oneself, the main reason many people choose to hike is for the physical activity it provides. "Walking" could be considered a possible answer, but it is more general and does not necessarily imply a specific purpose or motivation behind the activity. "Becoming tired" and "fatigue" are not reasons for hiking, but rather potential outcomes or challenges that may need to be overcome during the hike.
let down | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person expected to get a job but did not receive an offer. The phrase "feel" implies an emotional response, and the options include different emotions that could be associated with this situation. "Let down" is the most appropriate answer as it indicates a feeling of disappointment or disillusionment when expectations are not met. The other options are unlikely to be associated with this situation - illness, for example, is a physical state rather than an emotion, while satisfaction and gratitude would not be appropriate responses to not getting a job offer. Fear also does not fit because there is no indication of what the person is afraid of.
middle ages | Knowledge: The concept of knights originated in the Middle Ages, which was a period of European history from the 5th to the 15th century. Knights were warriors who were trained in combat and chivalry, and they were prominent figures in the feudal system of medieval Europe. The other options are not related to the historical context of knights, and only represent fictional or recreational contexts.
natural habitat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fox's appearance was a regular occurrence in the area surrounding the cabin. The phrase "come out of the woods" implies that the fox lives in a natural environment, rather than a man-made one like a swimming pool or hen house. The term "habitat" refers to the natural environment in which an animal lives, which further supports the conclusion that the correct answer is "natural habitat." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
enjoyed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children had a positive reaction to being given ice cream, since the word "enjoyed" implies a sense of pleasure or satisfaction. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "awesome" could be a possible answer if the sentence was describing someone's reaction to hearing about the ice cream, but it doesn't make sense as a response to actually receiving it. "Play chess" and "skip" are unrelated and have no relevance to the sentence. "Sadness" is the opposite of what one would expect in response to being given ice cream.
supermarket | Knowledge: The question is asking where air can be found to fill up balloons. The option "balloon" does not make sense as it refers to the object being filled, not the source of air. "Space shuttle" and "clouds" are not plausible sources of air for filling balloons. "House" may have air, but it is not a common place where people fill balloons. "Supermarket" is a likely answer as they often sell small canisters of compressed air for filling balloons.
feel remorse | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the gangster is used to killing people and it has become a part of his lifestyle. However, the use of the word 'surely' suggests that there might be a chance of him feeling regret for his actions. This indicates that he might feel remorse. The other options do not make sense in the context of this sentence.
become more popular | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person already has many friends, but continues to socialize. This suggests that they are seeking something beyond just having fun and may have a desire for more social status or popularity. Option C, "become more popular," directly references this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options are either too general or not relevant to the context of the sentence.
state facts | Knowledge: The sentence implies that professors use a particular method to prove their points. "State facts" is the most direct and logical answer because professors often use research or other evidence to support their arguments. The other options, such as "teach courses" or "master physics," do not describe a specific way that professors prove their points.
hurt yourself | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a potential consequence to tripping while playing basketball. The most likely outcome is that you would hurt yourself, as falling while playing sports can often result in injuries. The other options, such as sweat and dribbling, are not relevant to the question and do not describe what would happen if you tripped. Making baskets is the objective of the game, not a consequence of tripping.
calmness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Laura and Bob are having a calm and rational conversation regarding a sensitive topic. The use of words such as "tentative agreement" and "negotiation" suggests that the conversation is being conducted in a calm and measured manner. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they suggest a more emotional and reactive response.
go to jail | Knowledge: The sentence states that James is worried about committing perjury, which is a crime. Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law, which is a serious offense that can result in jail time. Therefore, it makes sense that James would be afraid he'll go to jail if he participates in Bob's plan. The other choices are also negative consequences, but they do not specifically relate to the crime of perjury.
sorrow  | Knowledge: The question is asking about emotions related to not getting paid which implies that the situation being discussed is a lack of financial compensation for work. "Sorrow" is a fitting emotion in this context as not getting paid can be a source of disappointment, worry, or even desperation. The other options, such as "income tax" and "blissfulness," do not make sense in this context.
controversy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the news revealed by the senator was something that caused a stir or created a dispute. Controversy is a word often used to describe situations in which different opinions or beliefs clash, which could be the case when a senator reveals information about a governor's office. The other options do not necessarily describe an appropriate reaction to this type of situation.
go to jail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that starting a fire on purpose is illegal and can lead to consequences. Going to jail is a common punishment for breaking the law, and starting fires without proper permits or in restricted areas is a crime in many places. Death or burns are potential physical consequences of starting a fire, but they are not the expected outcome if someone is caught. Warmth and a reward are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense as answers.
long life | Knowledge: The question asks what could cause someone to be staying healthy, which implies a long-term state of physical well-being. Long life is a common outcome of healthy behaviors such as eating well, exercising regularly, and avoiding risky behaviors like smoking or excessive drinking. The other options are not directly related to physical health, and in some cases may even have a negative impact on health (such as budget cuts leading to a lack of access to healthcare).
communication | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker uses clothing as a way to express themselves. The use of "even ugly clothing" suggests that the speaker is not necessarily using their attire to be fashionable or to have fun, but rather to communicate something about themselves or their mood. The option "communication" is the most fitting choice, as it directly relates to the context of the sentence. "Embarrassment" may also seem possible, but since the sentence does not suggest that the speaker is intentionally embarrassing themselves, it is not the best answer.
harbor  | Knowledge: A harbor is a designated area of water that is protected and sheltered from rough currents and waves, making it a safe space for boats to dock and anchor. The other options, such as at sea, lake, or ocean, do not necessarily guarantee safety and may have unpredictable water conditions. While boats do typically operate on water, the question specifically asks for a safe space, indicating the need for a protected area.
drink coffee | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there were warnings about not doing something near a printer, and that people were not following those warnings. The correct option must be something that people might do near a printer that could cause problems. Drinking coffee is a common activity that could pose a risk to a printer if the liquid is spilled or the steam causes condensation on the sensitive components. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: Bees are commonly found in natural settings, such as gardens, parks, and the countryside. They are attracted to flowers and other vegetation, which provide them with nectar and pollen. A single bee is less likely to be found in a crowded or urban area, such as a soft drink or the United States in general. A swarm of bees refers to a large group of bees, and an apiary is a place where bees are kept and managed.
metro station | Knowledge: The use of the term "train" suggests that the ticket booth is located in a place where trains are commonly used as a mode of transportation. Among the given choices, a metro station is the most likely candidate for having a ticket booth that sells train tickets. The other options are not associated with train travel, making them unlikely choices for the location of a train ticket booth.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while resting, you are trying to do something specific. The given answer choices include words like lazy and laziness, which do not indicate any particular goal. Falling asleep may be a part of relaxation, but it is not the same thing. Feel better could be a possible goal of resting, but it is too general to be the correct answer. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is relaxation, which implies the intentional pursuit of a calm and peaceful state of mind and body.
figure out | Knowledge: The phrase "require a large amount of thinking" suggests that the person is trying to solve a problem or come up with a solution. "Fatigue" and "depression" are negative states of mind that would likely hinder a person's ability to think critically. "Best way" and "new perspectives" do not necessarily imply a difficult problem that requires extensive thinking. Therefore, "figure out" is the best answer choice.
terrarium | Knowledge: A terrarium is a closed container designed for keeping small plants or animals that require a controlled environment. Zoological parks often have exhibits of reptiles, such as snakes, in terrariums. The other options do not make sense in the context of a zoological park: Kew Gardens is a botanical garden, a tree is unlikely to be an exhibit for snakes, a thick forest is not a controlled environment, and a field is too open and uncontrolled for displaying snakes.
thirst | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of not drinking enough. Thirst is a common symptom of dehydration, which occurs when the body doesn't have enough fluids to function properly. While headaches, sickness, vomiting, and other symptoms can also be associated with dehydration, thirst is the most direct and immediate consequence of not drinking enough water.
compete  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that jealousy can arise when two people engage in a certain behavior. The options "wage war" and "destroy relationship" imply a negative interaction between two people, but do not specifically suggest the behavior that leads to jealousy. "Judge" implies a one-sided action, without necessarily involving another person. "Compete," on the other hand, describes a situation where two people are striving for the same goal and may feel jealous of each other's successes or abilities. Therefore, "compete" is the correct answer.
architecture | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the terrace was designed and constructed intentionally and with an artistic flair. The most likely option from the choices is a firm specializing in architecture, as they would have the knowledge and expertise to create such a complex and visually appealing structure. The other options, such as a rice paddy or financial firm, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
own death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there will be a consequence for someone who commits murder, even if they are not caught. The phrase "own death" implies that the consequence will be related to the person who committed the murder, rather than an external punishment like imprisonment or incarceration. It is also a widely recognized cultural belief that karma or guilt may eventually catch up with an individual who has committed a grave crime like murder. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James packed everything, including his peanut butter, into a single object. The most logical object for him to pack everything into, including a jar of peanut butter, would be a container, such as a jar. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
opera house | Knowledge: A soprano is a type of female singer with a high-pitched voice, typically used in opera. An opera house is a venue specifically designed to host opera performances, and is where a soprano would most likely perform live for money. A movie or theater may also feature live performances, but they are not typically associated with operatic singing. A choit and choir are not even words, and are not relevant options.
help people | Knowledge: The question implies that being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands has a positive impact on the world. The phrase "help people" is the only option that suggests a benefit to others, which aligns with the idea of doing something good for the world. The other options, such as "gain" or "add to," do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
spending money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person brought their wallet with them because they intended to buy something. Buying products typically involves the exchange of money for goods or services, which requires having money, or spending money. The other options do not fit the context of someone bringing their wallet with them to make a purchase.
get cast | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question suffered a broken leg from their fall. Getting a cast is a common treatment for a broken leg, which would help to immobilize the bone and promote healing. The other options do not make sense in the context of a broken leg and falling down. Trying to learn or feeling proud are not relevant to the physical injury, catching a cold is unrelated, and needing assistance is too general to be a correct answer.
water fountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for an alternative source of water due to concerns about the cleanliness of the current one, which is likely a water fountain. A kettle or teapot would not be used for drinking straight from the spout, and a garage or gasoline can have no relevance to the context.
boredom  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James does not enjoy watching other people play baseball, which means that he likely finds it uninteresting or tedious. This feeling is commonly described as boredom which is the opposite of enjoyable. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
forgetfulness | Knowledge: When a person is intoxicated, their cognitive abilities and memory recall may be impaired, leading to forgetfulness of events that occurred while they were drunk. Stumbling and passing out are physical symptoms of being drunk, while a hangover typically occurs the next day and does not explain why someone would not remember where they left something while they were drunk. Confusion may be a symptom of intoxication, but forgetfulness is a more direct explanation for not remembering where something was left.
going to prison | Knowledge: Committing a murder is a serious crime that carries a potential punishment of imprisonment. The other options are not appropriate consequences for committing murder. Feeling guilty may be a personal reaction, but it is not a legal consequence. Being rewarded is completely unrelated and fear is not a direct consequence of being accused of a murder.
manual | Knowledge: When buying something new, it is common to receive a manual or instruction booklet that provides information on how to use the product, troubleshoot any issues, and handle maintenance. Manuals are often provided in physical form, but may also be available online. Books and pamphlets may also provide information, but they are not typically associated with a specific product or purchase as directly as a manual is. Meeting is not a typical source of information when buying something new.
respiration | Knowledge: Hard breathing when sick can be caused by respiratory problems such as inflammation, congestion or infection in the lungs or airways. Respiration refers to the process by which the body takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide during breathing. The other options do not relate to the physiological process of breathing or respiratory health.
happy | Knowledge: Going to play is typically associated with positive emotions, such as enjoyment and happiness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "happy." The other options, while related to positive emotions, don't necessarily fit the context of the question. For example, "being entertained" implies that someone else is doing the entertaining, which may not be the case if a child is just going to play on their own. "Surprised" and "meet" don't fit the context at all.
trash | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cardboard box is not usable anymore, and therefore it needs to be disposed of. The most appropriate place to put such a box is in the trash. The other options do not make sense in the given context. The warehouse might be a good place to store boxes that can be used, the post office deals with sending packages and not disposing of them, food has no connection to the context, and a garage is a place to park cars and not dispose of boxes.
anything | Knowledge: The word "omnipotent" means having unlimited power and therefore the ability to do anything. The word "often" suggests that this depiction is common or widely accepted. While God may be associated with other actions like providing peace or judgement, the word "omnipotent" specifically refers to the ability to do anything. The options "home" and "everywhere" are not in line with the definition of omnipotence.
country club | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the reception is being held in close proximity to a golf course. In this scenario, it is likely that the reception would take place at a country club, which typically has a golf course on its premises. The other options, such as a large room or a church basement, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A golf cart and a lobby are also unlikely venues for a reception.
northern | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Southern is being contrasted with another geographic direction, which would be its opposite. Out of the choices given, northern is the most commonly used antonym of southern. The other options, such as southernwort, boreal or septentrional, do not have any clear relation to the context of the sentence.
farmer's market | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to buy peas locally, which implies they are looking for a place that sells fresh produce. While all the options may sell peas, only the farmer's market specifically emphasizes locally sourced and fresh produce. The other options may sell peas that are frozen or shipped from far away, but they do not meet the criterion of being local and fresh.
shelf | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the old lady is in a store looking for a can of paint, and the employee is helping her. The employee got the can of paint "for her," which suggests it was taken from a specific location that the employee knew where to find. The most likely location for a can of paint in a store would be on a shelf, as opposed to a wall, hardware store, paintbrush, or windowsill.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location is a place where deep fryers are used, which is a common piece of equipment in restaurants. Restaurants also tend to be busy places where food is prepared and served, which matches the description given in the sentence. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not involve food preparation or the use of deep fryers.
new ideas | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people who are not influenced by the morals of a higher power (i.e. religion) have greater freedom to explore and think about scientific concepts. Therefore, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative ideas. The other options do not necessarily follow from the sentence's context.
speak up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob wants to talk but is unable to do so because of the presence of gnats. "Speaking up" would mean raising his voice in order to overcome the disturbance caused by the gnats. The other options do not address the issue of Bob being unable to communicate due to the presence of gnats.
neck | Knowledge: The question is asking about what a head attaches to, which suggests that the answer is a body part. Among the choices, "neck" is the only body part mentioned, and it is also the most commonly associated body part for a head to attach to. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the question.
introducing yourself | Knowledge: When meeting people for the first time, it is common to introduce oneself. This helps establish a connection and can lead to further conversation. Hugging and making friends are not appropriate actions until after an introduction has been made. Smiling is a friendly gesture, but does not establish a formal introduction. Shaking hands is another common way to greet someone in a formal setting.
coral reef | Knowledge: Blowfish are a type of fish that are commonly found in coral reefs. Therefore, it is likely that an image of a blowfish would be found in a depiction or photograph of a coral reef environment. The other options do not have any clear connection to blowfish.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the change is not needed immediately, so it should be stored somewhere. The most logical option would be a jar or container, which can hold loose change and be easily accessible when needed. The other options do not provide logical storage solutions for change - putting it in a purse or pocket could result in it being lost or spent, a slot machine is not a storage option, and a casino is not a practical place to store loose change.
recorded | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sound of the band's performance was not actually live, but rather pre-recorded. The word "previously" indicates that the sound was not produced in real-time during the live performance, but was instead recorded beforehand. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
fun | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is related to socializing with friends through chatting. While love, answers, inspiration, and relaxation can be reasons for socializing, the word "fun" is commonly associated with engaging in activities with friends. Chatting is often seen as a social activity where people exchange humorous or entertaining messages, catch up on each other's lives, and simply enjoy each other's company. The other options are less likely to be the main reason why people engage in chatting with friends.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that graveyards are typically located outside of a specific group of homes and businesses. The options "Arlington," "church property," and "every town" do not provide any clear indication of the type of location being referred to. The option "city" is the most likely choice, as graveyards are often located on the outer edges of urban areas rather than in the middle of them.
improve yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning more about your weakest subjects will have a positive effect on you. The phrase "improve yourself" implies personal growth and development, which can be achieved through acquiring knowledge in areas where one is struggling. The other options are not specific enough to describe the outcome of learning more about your weakest subjects.
learn to walk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running is a skill that is built on top of another skill. Before someone can run, they need to learn how to walk. This is a developmental milestone that most people go through as children. Stretches and buying shoes are related to running, but they don't address the fundamental skill needed to start running. "Act quickly" and "go quickly" are also not related to developing the skill needed to run.
make money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the investor may not have had his client's best interests in mind, as he kept insisting that the client had to spend money. The phrase "make money" is commonly associated with investing, as the goal of investing is typically to earn a profit. The other options, such as "go shopping" or "steal money," do not make sense in the context of an investment scenario.
anxiety | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question is talented but reluctant to perform, which suggests a potential lack of confidence or discomfort with being in the spotlight. Anxiety is a common psychological condition characterized by feelings of apprehension or dread, which could explain why this person doesn't enjoy performing despite their talent. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or are incorrect.
crushed ice | Knowledge: Crushed ice is commonly used to cool drinks as it quickly lowers the temperature of the liquid. Liquid nitrogen is too cold and dangerous to handle, a steam room would only make the water hotter, tidal waves and oceans have no relevance to the question.
aviary | Knowledge: Bald eagles are birds and are commonly housed in aviaries in zoological parks. The other options are not relevant to the natural habitat or living situation of a bald eagle. Bald eagles are also commonly associated with the United States, particularly Washington D.C. where they are the national bird and seal, but this does not necessarily mean they would be found there in a zoological park.
time | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that to understand someone better in a serious relationship requires something that takes a certain amount of duration or duration itself. Effort, consistency, thinking, and knowledge of someone can all be beneficial in building a relationship, but they don't necessarily require a specific amount of time to accomplish. The only answer that fulfills this requirement is "time."
san francisco bay | Knowledge: The fact that the shark kept bumping into piers suggests that it is in a location with man-made structures such as a harbor or bay. San Francisco Bay is a famous location for sharks to get trapped due to the Golden Gate Bridge and other structures. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence refers specifically to a brass instrument, which is commonly used in marching bands. Members of marching bands typically carry their instruments while they play, as they are required to move in formations during performances. The other options, such as jazz band or punk rock band, do not necessarily require the musician to carry their instrument while playing. "Annoy mom" is clearly not a relevant option.
reputable | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man's poor references are preventing him from getting a job, suggesting that he needs to work on his reputation. Being reputable means having a good and respectable reputation, which is important for employment prospects. The other options don't relate to the context of the sentence and may even suggest an opposite meaning (e.g. being famous doesn't necessarily equate to being good at getting a job).
sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was lying on his back and looking up at a bright light source. This is most likely the sky, as the other options (lamp, hallway, dark, closed room) do not fit the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that John initially thought there was a door suggests that he was in an enclosed space, so it is unlikely that he would be looking at a hallway or a dark room.
afternoon | Knowledge: The sentence states that Simon was meeting Jane in the afternoon, so it can be assumed that he needed to finish his project before that time. The options "evening" and "before lunch" are not consistent with the information given in the sentence. The option "after" is too vague and does not provide a specific time frame. The option "morning" is too early and does not match the time of the planned meeting.
pleasure | Knowledge: The adage being described suggests that it is not wise to mix two specific things together, one of which is business. The other option that makes the most sense to pair with business is pleasure, as it suggests that engaging in activities solely for enjoyment or personal gratification may not be conducive to conducting business in a professional manner. The other options do not fit the context of the adage.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two individuals were considering going out for coffee, which could be expensive. The use of the word "just" indicates that the woman found an alternative option that was more budget-friendly, so she had the coffee at a different location. Among the choices given, only "friend's house" could be a budget-friendly option for having coffee. The other options, such as parent's house or grocery store, do not make sense in the context of having coffee.
tires | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that John wanted a silo home due to its energy efficiency. Silo homes are typically made by repurposing old grain silos, and the thick walls of the silo provide insulation that helps regulate temperature. One common method of insulation for silo homes is to stack layers of used tires inside the silo walls, which traps air and provides a high level of insulation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
solar system | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place that humans do not often go, and the options are all different types of locations. A bus and an apartment building are both common places that humans go to. A space shuttle is a vehicle that humans use to go to space, so it is not a location where humans do not often go. Inside the Earth also refers to places where humans have explored before, such as caves or mines. The solar system, on the other hand, refers to the entire system of planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies that are not easily accessible or explored by humans. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
accidents | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that moving cars without looking can lead to negative consequences. Accidents are a common result of not paying attention while driving, and this option is the most closely related to the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential outcome of not looking while moving cars.
property | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer involves something that can be extended in order to increase the size of a backyard. In this context, "property" refers to the land on which a house is built, and extending one's property could involve purchasing additional land or negotiating with neighbors to acquire part of their land. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
climbing to higher level | Knowledge: The word "ladder" is associated with climbing to a higher level. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
treasure chest | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that Bill is looking to make a lot of money quickly and while sailing in a specific location, the Caribbean. The option "treasure chest" makes the most sense as it aligns with the idea of finding a valuable stash of money or goods that may have been hidden in the area during pirate times. The other options such as a bank, stock market or even real estate are unlikely to provide the quick and substantial returns that Bill seeks in this context.
backyard | Knowledge: A wagon meant for work would likely be used outdoors, and therefore would be best kept in a location that is easily accessible from the outside. Of the choices given, only the backyard fits this criteria. The garage and kitchen cabinet are typically indoor locations, while the field would not provide adequate protection for the wagon from the elements. The toy store is not a relevant option for storing a work wagon.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan was content with his current lifestyle in a big city, but he felt like something was missing. The most likely answer is that he was searching for happiness, as this is a common pursuit for people who feel unfulfilled. The other options are not related to Dan's situation or are unlikely answers based on the context of the sentence.
entertained | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James uses television as a form of relaxation or leisure activity after a hard day's work. The word "entertained" implies that he enjoys watching TV and finds it enjoyable. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "laziness" implies that James is being unproductive or avoiding work, "falling asleep" implies that watching TV makes him sleepy, "visual" does not make sense in this context, and "conformity" has no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
skeleton | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the physiologist identified a bone, which is a part of a skeleton. Therefore, the correct answer is skeleton. The other options are not directly related to bones, as vertebrates and fresh fish can have bones but are not specifically about identifying a bone. Fossil refers to something that is preserved from a past geological age and cannot be identified in real-time, and dog's mouth is too specific and unrelated to the context of identifying a bone.
read a book | Knowledge: The other options may provide temporary distractions from boredom, but reading a book can offer a more long-lasting solution as it engages the mind and can provide a sense of fulfillment. Additionally, reading has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce stress, making it a healthy and productive way to deal with boredom.
victory | Knowledge: The phrase "reaching advantage" implies that the boxer has a longer reach than their opponent. A longer reach can help the boxer land punches from a safer distance and keep their opponent at bay. This can ultimately lead to a greater chance of winning the match, or achieving victory. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
table | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John saw a plate and silverware set aside specifically for him, which implies that he was either at a table or in a dining setting. Therefore, the most likely answer is "table." While "restaurant" could be a possible answer, it is less specific and could refer to any location where food is served. "In a train" and "kitchen" do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not imply a dining scenario.
appeals | Knowledge: The term "passing sentence" refers to a legal process where a judge issues a verdict or penalty. After such a sentence is issued, it is possible for the convicted person to file an appeal to challenge the ruling. Therefore, the correct answer is "appeals." The other options, such as death, grief, anger, and grammar, are not related to the legal system or the process of passing sentence.
i'm hungry | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker wants to make bread quickly because he is hungry and wants to eat. The other options do not fit logically with the context of the sentence.
feeling good | Knowledge: The question implies that kissing has some positive effect, and the options suggest various positive outcomes. "Feeling good" is the most general and neutral among the options, and it can be applied to different kinds of kissing (e.g., romantic, friendly, familial). While some kissing may lead to arousal, sexual excitement, or pleasure, these options are more specific and may not always be true for everyone. "Being happy" is also a general positive outcome, but it is too broad and may not be directly related to kissing.
national park | Knowledge: The use of the term "protected" suggests that the location being referred to is likely an area where certain species are safeguarded or conserved. A national park is a protected area designated by a government for the conservation of natural resources and wildlife, making it the best fit among the other options listed. A zoo typically refers to a controlled environment where animals are kept for public exhibition, while a burrow is a hole dug by a small animal as a dwelling. The American West does not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence. The term "in the wild" is too broad and does not offer any specific information about the location being referred to.
attic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being described has a lower ceiling than other areas. The attic is typically located at the top of a building and has a sloping roof, which means that the ceiling is usually closer to the floor than in other areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
knowledge | Knowledge: Remembering every answer on a test is likely to show that the person has a good understanding of the material and has acquired knowledge as a result of studying. Nostalgia and depression are unrelated to the context of the question. Problems may be a result of not remembering answers on a test, but the question asks about the act of remembering every answer. Instruction is also unrelated to the context of the question.
full bloom | Knowledge: The phrase "full bloom" suggests that the garden is at its peak of beauty, with all the flowers and plants in full bloom. This is a time when the garden is most vibrant, colorful and fragrant, making it the most beautiful. The other options do not relate to the concept of a garden's beauty.
pride | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about an emotional response to winning against a challenging opponent. "Pride" is an emotion commonly associated with feeling good about oneself for accomplishing something, especially when it is difficult or requires effort. "Encouraging" and "one winner" do not accurately describe an emotional response, and "injury" is not related to the context of the sentence. "Proud" is a synonymous choice to "pride."
person | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bailey initially thought they saw something scary, but upon closer examination, they realized it was just a person. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
sunny window | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has an indoor plant that they enjoy, but it requires specific conditions to thrive. The word "sunny" suggests that the ficus plant needs an adequate amount of sunlight to grow well. Additionally, the other options like tropical forest, ecosphere, and tropical rainforest are not relevant to the context of the sentence as they describe outdoor environments rather than indoor conditions.
play tricks on | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's brain was not functioning properly, which could cause it to fool him or deceive him in some way. The phrase "play tricks on" is often used to describe situations where something appears one way but is actually something else, which could be a symptom of an impaired mental state. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
own home | Knowledge: Taking a bath is typically done in a private and comfortable setting, which is most likely to be one's own home. The other options do not offer the same level of privacy and convenience that is associated with taking a bath at home.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was already heading home, which means they were most likely already at their lodging. Since the sentence mentions a gift shop, it is likely that the lodging they were staying at had one. Out of the given choices, only a hotel or a resort are common places to stay where a gift shop would be present. The other options such as an airport or a museum are less likely to have gift shops. Disneyland is a theme park and not a lodging, so it would not be the correct answer.
house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the machine for making bread is kept in a place where it can be accessed frequently for personal use. The options "laboratory," "museum," and "industrial area" do not fit in this context as they suggest that the machine is part of a larger production or scientific process rather than for individual use. The option "bathroom" is unlikely as it is not a common place to keep kitchen appliances, making "house" the most likely answer.
cool off | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that ice has a specific function or purpose. Based on common knowledge and context, ice is commonly used to cool drinks and food, or to cool down a person's body temperature. The other options do not align with the functional purpose of ice or the context of the sentence.
bank account | Knowledge: The question is asking for a common place where people keep money that is not in their wallet. Bank accounts are the most common place for people to keep their money as they offer security and the ability to earn interest. The other options, such as outside or at a race track or casino, are unlikely places for people to keep their money as they are not secure or reliable. An art show may involve selling artwork, but it is not a common place for people to store their money.
tomb | Knowledge: The description of the players' physical reactions (getting chills and goosebumps) suggests that they were entering a space that was eerie, scary, or awe-inspiring. This would be an apt description of a tomb, which is associated with death and can often be dark and creepy. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - an arena, for example, might be exciting or fun rather than scary, and water or a public building would not typically be associated with the physical sensations described.
african continent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baboon is a species of monkey that is native to a specific region. The option "african continent" is the most likely answer because baboons are commonly found in various parts of Africa. The other options, such as "amazon basin" and "rain forest," are associated with South America and may be home to other monkey species, but not baboons. "Zoological gardens" is a man-made location where baboons may be found but is not their native habitat.
talking | Knowledge: Making friends typically involves some form of communication or interaction, which is best achieved through talking. The other options are not typical behaviors associated with making friends - falling in love may happen as a result of a friendship, but it is not a typical starting point; smiling can convey friendliness, but it does not necessarily lead to a friendship; starting a fight is not a friendly behavior; and getting drunk may hinder one's ability to make friends.
compete against | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the person is feeling pride when they see their team and size up the opposing team, which suggests that they are about to compete against the other team. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and there is no indication that the person is about to do anything related to passing a class, painting a house, improving themselves, or playing hopscotch.
biased | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the station chose not to censor the show, which implies that the content could potentially be controversial or offensive. If the station remained neutral or animated, they would be unlikely to allow such content to air without censorship. Additionally, the use of the phrase "no tape delay" suggests that the station was willing to take the risk of airing potentially controversial content without giving themselves a buffer to edit or cut out any inappropriate material. These factors suggest that the correct answer is "biased," meaning that the station allowed potentially controversial or biased material to be aired without censorship. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feel comfortable | Knowledge: The question is asking for the reason behind wanting to get warm when someone is feeling cold. The most logical answer is to feel comfortable because being cold can be uncomfortable and unpleasant. The other options do not provide a clear rationale for wanting to get warm when cold, such as doing somersaults or becoming more comfortable (which doesn't explain why one would want to become more comfortable).
auditorium | Knowledge: The use of the word "stage" suggests that the room is likely a performance or presentation space. While some of the other options could potentially have stages (such as a school auditorium or a church), the mention of a folding chair and the lack of any other descriptive details points towards a more generic, less permanent performance space like an auditorium.
refuse | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when someone does not want something, they take a specific action towards it. "Stockpile" means to accumulate large quantities of something, which is not applicable in this context. "Reject" means to dismiss or refuse something, which makes it the correct choice. "Negative" and "detest" are emotions or attitudes that someone might have towards something, but they do not indicate a specific action. Therefore, "refuse" is the best answer based on the context of the sentence.
relaxing | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the purpose of listening to music in this particular scenario is to unwind or relax. Therefore, the correct answer should be a word that conveys a sense of relaxation. The options "enjoyable," "fun," "pleasurable," and "entertainment" could all be used to describe music, but they do not necessarily imply relaxation. However, the word "relaxing" specifically describes the effect that music has in this context, making it the correct answer.
gravesite | Knowledge: When looking for information about human ancestors, gravesites are a logical place to start. Gravesites can provide information about ancestors' names, birth and death dates, and family relationships. Memorial sites may honor ancestors, but they are generally not places where one would go to gather information about ancestors. Schools and interesting places may have historical information, but they are not specifically related to finding information about human ancestors. A temperate climate may be comfortable for exploring gravesites, but it is not directly related to finding information about ancestors.
advantageous | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bad move the person made turned out to be unexpectedly fortunate for them. This indicates that they are now in a position that benefits them in some way, which aligns with the definition of advantageous. The other options do not have the same connotation of benefiting from a mistake or error.
class room | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about where students do most of their learning, which implies a formal educational setting. The classroom is the most common and traditional setting for teaching and learning in schools, making it the most likely answer. The other options may offer opportunities for learning, but they are not the primary location for formal education.
on their desk | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the person is working at a desk or in an office setting, so keeping the eyeglasses case on their desk would be the most practical and convenient option. Keeping it in a drawer might make it difficult to access quickly, and keeping it in a bag or the car would require leaving the desk or workspace to retrieve it. Keeping it in a shirt pocket might be uncomfortable or not practical for everyone.
computer screen | Knowledge: The question implies that the viewing is related to a task that is currently being performed. The most likely tool for displaying such information is a computer screen, as it is a common platform for managing tasks in many industries. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as they are not typically used for displaying task-related information.
peculiar | Knowledge: The word "mediocre" suggests that Greg's performance was average or unremarkable. Therefore, it is unlikely that his habits would be distinguished, unique, exceptional, or outstanding. The word "peculiar" means unusual or strange, which could be a possible explanation for why Greg's performance was not impressive.
warm place | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker put a towel in a cardboard box for a kitten. The word "wanted" indicates that they had a specific intention or goal in mind. The options "farmhouse" and "zoos" do not provide any useful information in this context. The option "cold place" is unlikely, as it would not be a suitable environment for a young animal. "Floor" is also unlikely, as the speaker would not have gone to the effort of putting a towel in a box if they intended for the kitten to sleep on the floor. "Warm place" is the most appropriate option, as it would ensure the kitten's comfort and safety.
scientific knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person who is focused on learning about science will be gaining some form of knowledge related to the field. The other options do not relate to science or learning in the same way. Atheism is a belief system, not a field of study or form of knowledge. Having fun and gaining new ideas may be potential outcomes of learning about science, but they are not the main focus or purpose of scientific education. Therefore, the correct answer is scientific knowledge.
prison | Knowledge: The question suggests that humans are being kept in a confined space in large numbers, which is a characteristic of a prison. Prisons are designed to hold a large number of people in a limited space, often with minimal amenities or living conditions. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as humans are not typically kept in large numbers in small spaces in a solar system, school, apartment building, or bus.
public building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that this type of building is open to the general public and has an entrance hall that is commonly used by random citizens. Schools may be open to the public for events, but they typically have designated entrances for students and faculty. Large buildings and auditoriums can have public access, but the sentence emphasizes the use of an entrance hall, which suggests a more formal type of building. A convention center is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any clues as to whether the building hosts events or conferences, which are typically associated with convention centers. Therefore, the best answer is a public building, which can refer to a variety of government or community facilities that are open to the public.
sew | Knowledge: The sentence directly states that the subject enjoyed fabric as a medium, which suggests that she worked with textiles in some capacity. The word "sew" is the only option that is specifically related to working with fabric. The other options, such as creating art, drawing, or writing, could potentially involve fabrics but are not directly related to the context of the sentence. "Express yourself" is a vague option that could apply to any medium, making it less likely to be the correct choice.
pay employees | Knowledge: The word "cheap" suggests that the company was trying to save money, and not paying employees would be a way to reduce expenses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
find facts | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the detective was searching for the truth and was sifting through lies to do so. To find the truth, one would need to gather all the facts and evidence available to them. Asking questions would also be a useful strategy, but it is mentioned in the sentence that the detective was already searching, which implies that they were actively looking for information rather than just asking for it. Lying, wondering, and searching for are not directly related to the notion of discovering the truth through sifting through lies.
grandma's house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the gathering of people is a place where a small dog will be happy. The option "grandma's house" may be the correct answer as it is a common stereotype that grandmas love spoiling furry creatures, including small dogs. The other options, such as "barbeque," "Canada," "baby carriage," and "basket," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
embrace | Knowledge: The sentence states that James and Lilly have strong feelings for each other, and to express those feelings, they kiss. This suggests that they are likely to engage in physical expressions of affection. Of the options given, only embrace is a physical expression of affection that would be likely in this situation. Shake hands and smile are too formal or platonic, while "falling in love" is not an action that can be taken at will.
homeless shelter or house, depending on the context | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place of shelter in an urban context. The most obvious and practical answers would be either a homeless shelter or a house, as both provide protection from the elements and a secure space to stay in. A shelterbelt and tree would not be practical options for most people seeking shelter, while a bus stop may provide some temporary protection but is not a long-term or reliable solution. However, the correct answer may depend on the specific context of the question, such as if the focus is on providing shelter for homeless individuals or finding a place to stay during a natural disaster.
button up | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the shirt was fastened with buttons, as the person started to unfasten it. The other options (pull up, zip up, tie up, do up) do not involve buttons and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
firearm | Knowledge: The mention of an antique pirate artifact suggests that the object is likely to be old and potentially valuable. Additionally, the fact that John needed a lock specifically for this object implies that it is something that needs to be secured. Out of the given choices, firearm is the most likely to fit this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to pirates or the need for a lock.
free will | Knowledge: The sentence presents a clear contrast between the woman's belief in fatalism and the man's belief in something related to personal agency or choice. The concept of free will directly opposes fatalism, as it asserts that individuals have control over their own actions and outcomes. The other answer choices may also be related to the context of the sentence, but they do not create a clear contrast with the woman's belief in fatalism.
sing | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the contestants were waiting for their chance to perform on American Idol. The other options, while related to waiting, do not have any connection to the specific activity that the contestants were waiting to do. "Sing" is the only answer that fits with the context and provides a clear and concise response to the question.
music store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person saved up money for a new bass, which is most likely a musical instrument, and therefore they would need to go to a music store to purchase it. The other options have no connection to purchasing a bass.
south pacific | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Tahiti, which is a destination located in the South Pacific. Sharks are often found in areas of open water, and the South Pacific is known to be home to numerous shark species. The other options such as the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean Sea are not associated with shark sightings near Tahiti. The pool hall is also an irrelevant option as it has nothing to do with geography or marine wildlife.
follow instructions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hiring officer was looking for someone who could do a job that required following specific instructions. This is a common requirement for jobs that involve working in a military context, where precision and attention to detail are essential. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the specific skills that would be needed for the job.
love | Knowledge: Tinder is a dating app designed specifically for people who are looking for romantic relationships. Therefore, it is logical that the app would encourage meeting people as a way to find potential love interests. The other options, such as smile, anxiety, being happy, and making new friends, may be associated with meeting people, but they do not directly relate to the purpose of the app.
rice paddy | Knowledge: The term "wet terrace" is commonly used to refer to a type of rice cultivation where rice is grown on terraced fields that are irrigated with water. This method of cultivation is popular in many Asian countries like Japan, China, and Vietnam, and is commonly referred to as a "rice paddy." Therefore, it can be inferred that Jane is likely working on a rice paddy in one of these countries. The other options are not related to farming or agriculture in any way.
roadblock | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people were trying to prevent the parade from continuing, and they took some action to stop it. The option "roadblock" is the most logical answer as it is a common method of stopping traffic or preventing movement. The other options such as carnival, public place, apartment, and space shuttle have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence, therefore can be eliminated.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog might be found in a location that is likely to be its home, such as a backyard. The mention of a white coat could also suggest that the dog is a breed that commonly has a white coat, which further supports the idea that it may be a pet dog. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pretty | Knowledge: The verb "gawked" implies that the woman was staring at the diamonds in wonder or admiration. The adjective "pretty" is commonly used to describe something that is visually appealing, making it the most likely choice. "Rare" and "translucent" may describe the diamonds accurately, but they do not necessarily reflect the woman's reaction to them. "Edible" is obviously not a plausible choice.
have fun | Knowledge: The question implies that the book is a form of entertainment or distraction from boredom, rather than a tool for learning or practical use. "Have fun" is the most appropriate answer in this context, as it suggests engaging with the book for enjoyment or leisure. The other options do not fit this context as well - "learn new" implies that the book is being used for educational purposes, "play chess" suggests the book may be a chess manual or contain chess puzzles, "go somewhere" is not related to the book at all, and "look pictures" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in this context.
populated areas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Grace live in an area with a high population density, which might make it difficult for them to navigate their surroundings due to the large number of people. The other options don't fit with the context of the sentence: race tracks would have limited pedestrian traffic, opera houses would be indoor spaces, commotion is a general term for a noisy disturbance rather than a physical obstacle, and roadblocks would be an intentional obstruction rather than a natural result of living in a densely-populated area.
health centre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy used a spa as part of his injury rehabilitation, which is often recommended by doctors. The use of a spa for medical purposes would likely require a professional medical setting such as a health centre, not a house or backyard. Country clubs also typically do not have medical facilities. The option "leave" does not make sense in this context as it is not a location.
prepare food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to eat lunch, there is a necessary step of doing something with the food. Shopping for food suggests a need to acquire ingredients, but does not imply any further action. Eating food and finding food suggest a completed task, rather than a step in the process of having lunch. Having time for lunch is important, but not relevant to the specific question of what is needed to eat lunch. Therefore, prepare food is the correct choice as it implies action needed to make food that is suitable for eating.
intoxication or vomiting | Knowledge: Drinking alcohol too fast can lead to a rapid increase in blood alcohol content, which can cause intoxication. This can lead to impaired judgment, loss of coordination and balance, and slurred speech. In more severe cases, it can also lead to vomiting. Nausea can also be a symptom of alcohol consumption, but it may not be a direct result of drinking too fast. "Having fun" and "intelligence" are not likely to be consequences of excessive alcohol consumption.
airport | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's wife is arriving from France, which implies an international travel context. Out of the given options, the only place where international arrivals can be expected is an airport. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being ordered | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James does not appreciate being told what to do, which is a characteristic commonly associated with people who do not like being ordered around. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
speeding ticket | Knowledge: The question mentions driving too fast, which is commonly associated with breaking the speed limit. When a driver exceeds the speed limit, they are more likely to receive a speeding ticket. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
go to parties | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the college student was looking for social interaction, but had a specific dislike for a certain activity. The option "go to parties" is the most likely choice as parties are a common social gathering for college students. The other options do not have a clear connection to social interaction or the context of the sentence.
help people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John gave away internet ready computers because he was an idealist who wanted to make a positive impact on the world. Giving away computers is an act of charity that can help people who may not have access to technology, which aligns with the idea of wanting to help others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
specialty store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has specific preferences and only likes certain types of items. A specialty store often carries a selection of unique or niche products that may cater to specific tastes or interests. The other options, such as department stores or variety stores, may have a broader selection that may not cater to specific preferences. Christmas-related items, such as the Christmas tree and stocking, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
doing nothing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kid is tired of something that involves inactivity or lack of stimulation, which is best represented by the option "doing nothing." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they represent unrelated concepts such as emotions (serious, hatred) or entertainment (longplay, musical).
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's beef allergy could result in severe consequences if he eats hamburger, which could potentially lead to death. This is because allergies can cause anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction. The other options do not reflect the seriousness of the situation described in the sentence.
classroom | Knowledge: The question is about where students keep rubber bands, which implies that the location should be related to their school environment. Among the given choices, only "classroom" is a setting associated with students and where they could keep rubber bands for school-related activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
corvette | Knowledge: While all of the choices listed could potentially be a type of ship in a battleship fleet, the use of the word "small" in the sentence suggests that the answer is likely to be a smaller type of ship. A corvette is a smaller, faster type of warship commonly used in the navy, and would fit the context of the sentence as the small ship in the fleet. The other options, such as a submarine or destroyer, may be smaller in comparison to larger ships in the fleet, but they do not typically carry the connotation of being a smaller type of ship in general. Additionally, "gambit" is not a type of ship at all, and "frigate" is typically larger than a corvette.
sump pump | Knowledge: The question is asking about a tool used for removing water from a flooded room. The options "sink," "backhoe," "underground stream," and "hydroelectric dam" are not applicable, as they do not serve this purpose. A sump pump, on the other hand, is a device designed specifically for pumping water out of basements or other areas where water accumulates. This makes it the most logical choice among the given options.
focus on | Knowledge: The sentence implies that if you want to remember an event, there is something specific you should do while at it. "Focus on" is the most logical choice, as it suggests that you should actively pay attention to the details of the event and try to commit them to memory. "Take pictures" could also be a good option, but it implies that the person wants to preserve the memory visually rather than mentally. "Try" and "not forget" sound like vague instructions without any clear action attached to them, and "use a flame thrower" is obviously not relevant to the task at hand.
soccer game | Knowledge: The question mentions using the head on the ball, which is a common technique in the sport of soccer. Soccer is a sport where players use their feet and head to manipulate the ball and score goals, while the other options do not necessarily involve this type of interaction with the ball. A sporting event, stadium or hockey game could refer to a variety of sports where using the head on the ball is not necessarily common practice, while head ball refers to a specific game that may not be popular or widely known.
solution to problem | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe's skill in thinking and applying his thoughts to most situations had a positive impact and led to a specific outcome.  The term "solution to problem" directly relates to this idea and would be the most logical answer. The other options (sadness, depression, wonder) do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to Joe's skill in problem-solving.
questions or pay bills | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Bill is a customer of an electric company, so it is likely that he is calling about something related to his account. The most likely reasons he would be calling are to ask questions or to pay his bills. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence and don't make sense as reasons why Bill would be calling an electric company.
razor blade  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a drop of blood needs to be removed, which implies some unwanted blood stain. Out of the given choices, a razor blade is most commonly used to scrape off or cut away bloodstains from surfaces. A blood bank deals with storing and transferring blood, while a needle is used to draw blood. A slaughterhouse is a place where animals are killed for meat, and a person is too general to be a correct answer in this context.
indifference | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the parents were concerned about something, but the teacher responded in a way that was opposed to their concerns. The words "uncaring," "carelessness," and "carefree" all indicate a lack of concern or attention, which does not fit with the context of the sentence. "Apathy" and "indifference" both suggest a lack of emotional engagement or concern, but "indifference" fits better with the idea of a direct opposition to the parents' concerns.
hockey rink | Knowledge: The question mentions "using a puck professionally," which suggests that the activity being referred to is a sport or game. The option "hockey rink" is the most directly related to this clue, as hockey is a sport that involves the use of a puck. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
spell checker or documentation of facts | Knowledge: After recording something and having it transcribed, it would be helpful to check for any spelling errors or inaccuracies in the transcription. Therefore, a spell checker or documentation of facts would be useful to ensure the accuracy of the transcription. Evidence, recorder, and tape do not necessarily relate to the task of checking for errors in a transcription.
basement of apartment building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the laundry room is not accessible to a large number of people, which is a characteristic commonly associated with a laundry room in the basement of an apartment building. A laundry room in a hospital or hotel would likely be used by a larger number of people, and a laundry room in a college or house would likely be accessible to more people on a regular basis.
street |  | Knowledge: Bicycles are most commonly stolen from public spaces, such as streets and parking areas, where they are often left unattended and unsecured. Schoolyards may also be a target for theft, but it is less common than in public areas. Toy stores and the Netherlands are not likely to be relevant to bicycle theft. Garages are typically secure areas and less likely to be targeted, although thefts can sometimes occur if the garage is left unlocked or easily accessible.
doze | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the person is staying in bed and not moving because they are either sleeping or resting. The word "doze" specifically means to sleep lightly or take a nap, which fits this context. The other options do not relate to the idea of resting or sleeping. "Very private" is not a reason to stay in bed, "picking fleas off your dog" has no connection to the context, and "read book" and "reading book" are duplicates of each other and do not address the question.
social activism | Knowledge: The question suggests that the large groups are trying to bring about change in society, and social activism is a commonly used method for achieving this goal. Social activism involves advocating for social or political change through nonviolent means, such as protests, petitions, and letter-writing campaigns. Riots, arguing, and demonstrating can sometimes be associated with social activism, but they are not always effective or constructive ways of creating lasting change. "Change yourself" does not fit the context of the question, as it does not involve changing society as a whole.
restaurant | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the question is related to the hospitality industry, specifically in the service of food and drinks to customers. A waiter is a person who works in a restaurant and serves food and drinks to customers. Water is a common beverage that is served to customers, especially when they first sit down at the table. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
investigation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there has been a killing and the police are involved in some way. It is likely that their role will be related to investigating the crime and trying to gather evidence to determine who is responsible. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence - a gun could be involved in a killing, but it is not a role that the police would have. Pleasure and punishment are also unlikely to be relevant to the situation. Dies is not a role or action that the police would take, but rather an outcome of the situation.
cargo hold | Knowledge: A sailor is more likely to be on a boat than an airplane or movie, so options (b), (c), and (d) can be eliminated. Additionally, in the context of a voyage, it makes sense that the suitcase would be stored in a place where other cargo is also stored, such as the cargo hold. Therefore, (a) is the correct answer.
tank | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child has only seen jellyfish in a specific context and references a "tank," which is commonly associated with aquariums or other places where marine animals are kept for observation. The other options are all related to the ocean or sea, but do not provide any indication of a specific context or setting where the child may have seen jellyfish.
pets | Knowledge: The sentence implies that fish are a good option for someone who is just starting to have pets. This is likely because they do not require as much attention or care as other animals, such as dogs or cats. Additionally, the sentence mentions cleaning the tank and feeding the fish, which are typical responsibilities of a pet owner. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
harmful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was in a negative and potentially dangerous relationship where they did not feel safe. The use of the word "just" indicates that she did not want anything extravagant, but rather something basic like the feeling of safety. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence since they do not refer to a relationship.
sleep disorders | Knowledge: Snoring is often a symptom of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, which is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Snoring can also be a sign of other sleep-related problems such as allergies, nasal congestion, or obesity. None of the other options are likely to be associated with snoring.
belittle | Knowledge: The coach's explanation of respect suggests that he wanted his players to treat the opposing team with dignity and not diminish their abilities or character. Belittling is a specific term used to describe making someone or something seem small or unimportant, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as contemn, diss, castrate, and disregard, do not have a clear connection to the context or meaning of the sentence.
stadium | Knowledge: The use of the term "ticket booth" suggests that it is a place where tickets are sold to attend a specific event. While these booths can be found in various locations, the options subway and train station are unlikely to have a separate booth for just one event. The terms auditorium and venue are more generic and can refer to many different types of events. The option stadium, however, is a specific location commonly associated with sporting events and concerts where a ticket booth is typically located outside the building.
someone's face | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to anatomy or human body parts. The option "someone's face" is the most fitting answer, as it is commonly known that people have two eyes located on their face. The other options, such as "potato" or "faces," do not make sense in the context of the question. Additionally, the repetition of "someone's face" as one of the options may be a clue that it is the correct answer.
feel remorse | Knowledge: When someone hurts someone else, they may feel guilty or regretful for their actions. This feeling is commonly known as remorse. The other options, such as resentment, anger, and sadness, may also be felt in this situation, but remorse is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of responsibility for the harm done. The option "bad karma" is not a feeling but a belief or consequence commonly associated with Eastern religions and philosophies.
suburbs | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people moved away from Detroit to a location that is not in the city, but still relatively close. The options "forest", "wilderness", and "countryside" do not fit this description as they are more rural and located further away from urban areas. "On vacation" is also unlikely as people usually do not permanently move to vacation spots. "Suburbs" is the most likely answer as it is a common destination for people who want to move away from the city but remain close enough to commute.
nebraska | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Jeff Fortenberry is a Republican representative from a state whose capital is Lincoln. This narrows down the options to states that have Lincoln as their capital, which include Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. However, the sentence also specifies that Jeff Fortenberry is a Republican representative, which eliminates both Demopublican options. Therefore, the correct answer is Nebraska.
meet expectations | Knowledge: The question asks about a likely source of satisfaction when using an auto shop. Meeting expectations is a common source of satisfaction for customers in any industry, as it implies that the service or product provided met or exceeded their expectations. Having enough food, receiving compliments, and achieving goals are not related to auto shop services, while being knowledgeable may be important but does not necessarily guarantee satisfaction.
sky | Knowledge: Clouds are formed in the atmosphere and are usually seen at a higher elevation than ground level or the top of a building. They can be observed from the ground, but they are generally associated with the sky. Mountains may have clouds at the summit, but not necessarily all the time, and the same goes for the air which may have clouds depending on humidity and other factors.
staying put | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam is not willing to move from his current position despite Bess telling him to do so. "Staying put" is a commonly used idiom that means to remain in one place or position. The other options do not accurately describe Sam's actions in the sentence.
ground | Knowledge: Rocks can be found on the ground, as they are typically part of the Earth's surface. While rocks can also be found in mountains and mountain ranges, these are more specific locations and may not always have rocks readily available. Farms and countryside may have rocks present, but they are not a defining characteristic of these areas.
break easily | Knowledge: Glass is a fragile material that can easily break or shatter if mishandled, which is why it is important to handle it with care. The other options do not explain why we should handle glass with care. Many different colors, cut vegetables, melt, and hold water all have no bearing on the fragility of glass.
feel comfortable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to a basic need or desire that all humans share in their own home. While wealth and working hard may be desirable for some, they are not universal experiences that all humans want to have in their home. Similarly, laying eggs and falling in love are experiences that are specific to certain groups or categories of individuals, and are not applicable to all humans. On the other hand, feeling comfortable is a desire that is common to all individuals, and is particularly relevant to the context of home, which is typically viewed as a safe and comfortable space.
northern california | Knowledge: The mention of a redwood tree suggests that the location is in a region known for having these trees. Redwoods are primarily found in Northern California, so this is the correct answer. The other options, while some are located in the western United States, do not have a known association with redwood trees.
jar | Knowledge: Peanut butter is typically stored in jars, which are designed to keep the product fresh and prevent it from drying out. The other options listed are not likely to be associated with peanut butter specifically - a cupboard could contain many different types of food or kitchen supplies, a supermarket is a place where peanut butter can be bought but not necessarily taken out of, a container could refer to any type of storage vessel which may or may not be appropriate for peanut butter, and a pantry is a larger storage space where a variety of food items may be kept.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally was relieved upon discovering the truth. This is because the phrase "after so much worry" implies that she was anxious or stressed about something, and discovering the truth likely gave her a sense of relief or peace of mind. The other options may also be positive emotions, but they do not have the same connection to the context of the sentence.
West Virginia | Knowledge: The Shenandoah Valley is a well-known region in West Virginia, and is even sometimes called the "Western Valley" to distinguish it from the Shenandoah Valley located in Virginia. While the other options in the choices may involve mountains or regions, they do not specifically refer to the Shenandoah Valley. Montana is a state known for its mountains, but the question is specifically asking about a valley. "Continent" and "Earth" are not relevant options as they are not states or locations within states.
run for president | Knowledge: The question is asking about how politicians compete for a "big event," which is likely a reference to a major election. Running for president is a common way for politicians to compete in a national election, which would fit with the context of the question. The other options do not have a clear connection to competing in an election, and may even have negative connotations (e.g. making false promises, talking nonsense).
ask questions | Knowledge: The sentence asks for the best way to learn new things from someone else, which implies that the answer needs to be an interactive approach. Going to school, being tutored, or studying could all be valid ways of learning new things, but they do not necessarily involve interaction with another person. "Fun" is also not a relevant answer, as it doesn't explain how to learn from someone else. Asking questions, however, is a way to actively engage with someone and gain knowledge from their expertise.
procreate | Knowledge: "Continuing the species" is a clear reference to reproduction. Procreation is the only option that directly relates to this process. The other options are not related to reproduction and do not make sense in the context of the question.
rollerblade | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer involves a tool or device that helps with movement from one place to another. Out of the choices given, only rollerblades are associated with personal transport and motion. While a helicopter can transport people and things from one place to another, it is not a tool that helps with personal movement. A lawn mower helps with cutting grass, scissors and a knife are cutting tools that do not aid in movement.
ocean | Knowledge: The fact that John's map had a lot of water on it and that it covered more than half of the map suggests that the map could be of a large body of water like an ocean. The other options such as car, puddle, sink, and surface of Earth do not make sense in context with the information given.
high places | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bald eagle likes to have a clear view of its surroundings, which indicates that it would prefer to be perched at a high vantage point. The other options do not suggest a connection to the behavior or habitat of bald eagles.
fingernails | Knowledge: The sentence implies that dirt can get under a specific body part, which suggests that it is a small and narrow area. Fingernails are known to accumulate dirt easily, especially if someone has been working in the garden or handling soil. The other options are not body parts and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: Out of the given choices, a supermarket is the most likely place to find a variety of chocolate options for purchase. While restaurants and hotels may offer chocolate desserts or gifts, they are not primarily known for selling chocolate. "Mouth" doesn't make sense in this context, and while a box could contain chocolate, it is not a place where one could buy it. Therefore, the correct answer is supermarket, which is a common location for purchasing groceries and food items.
bottle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to the storage of mouthwash, and typically, mouthwash is stored in a bottle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the first option is irrelevant to the question.
good credit | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is eligible for a car loan with a favorable interest rate. This suggests that the person has a good credit score, which indicates a history of responsible debt management and timely payments. Smooth skin and fresh produce have no relevance to the context of the sentence, while understanding oneself and having a headache are unrelated to financial matters.
urban area | Knowledge: Apartment buildings are typically associated with densely populated urban areas, where there is a high demand for housing and limited space. Suburbs and rural areas are often characterized by single-family homes and larger plots of land, while Indiana is a state and not a specific type of region. Housing unit is a broad term that could refer to any type of dwelling, including apartments, houses, and condos. Urban environment is a somewhat redundant phrase that does not provide any additional information.
valley | Knowledge: Apple trees are often grown in rows in agricultural settings like orchards, which are commonly found in valleys or other areas with fertile soil and suitable climate conditions for growing apples. New York and Washington state are both known for their apple production, but they do not provide any context as to where apple trees might be found in a row. A park or field might have some trees, but it is unlikely that they would be arranged in a row.
underground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a certain characteristic that buildings in downtown New York do not possess. The option "underground" seems to be the best choice since it is the opposite of "building" and would make sense in the context of downtown New York, where most buildings are above ground. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as buildings in downtown New York are generally known for being tall and huge, not small and solid.
grocery store | Knowledge: The word "weekly household essentials" suggests that the purchase was made at a grocery store, which is where most people buy groceries and other household necessities. The other options, such as a child's hand, clown, or sky, do not make sense in the context of purchasing household essentials. While a balloon may be associated with a birthday party, the sentence does not suggest that this was the case here.
play video games | Knowledge: The question is asking about what children like to do when they are not playing outside. Playing video games is a popular indoor activity for many children and is often a preferred form of entertainment over other options like rushing around or eating. Teaching parents and reaching over do not make sense in the context of the question and are not common activities that children engage in.
pond | Knowledge: Jellyfish are typically found in bodies of water, such as oceans, rivers, and ponds. The other options, such as store and office, do not make sense in the context of where jellyfish can be found in nature. Cuba may have bodies of water where jellyfish can be found, but the other options are a better fit based on general knowledge. Photographs may feature jellyfish, but they are not a location where jellyfish can actually be found.
classroom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about where a child's work would be displayed on a wall. The most likely place for a child's work to be displayed is in a classroom, where young students create artwork and hang it up for others to see. The other options, such as labyrinth or China, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Art shows may be a possible option, but the context of the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer.
bermuda | Knowledge: The sentence references the "mysterious triangle," which is a commonly known reference to the Bermuda Triangle. The fact that the lizard had not disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding the area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
strip club | Knowledge: Beavers are semi-aquatic animals that typically live in bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and millponds where they build their dams and lodges. Therefore, the options "lake or river" and "millpond" are likely places where a beaver would be found. The "helm of ship" option may be included since beavers are not typically found in marine environments. The "ontario" option may also be included since beavers are native to North America, including Ontario. However, "strip club" is an absurd and unrelated option that would be unlikely to be chosen.
harm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fire poses a danger to someone. "Harm" is the only option that directly relates to danger or injury, while the other options ("warm up," "charming," "warm hands") do not have a negative connotation. "Murder" is also not a likely outcome of a fire being out of control, as it suggests intent to kill.
theater | Knowledge: A catwalk is a narrow walkway used for accessing equipment or areas above the stage in a theater. The theater is the only option that is related to performance or entertainment, which is where catwalks are commonly found. The other options, such as a fieldhouse or stadium, are unlikely to have catwalks and are typically noisy environments. A construction site may have a catwalk, but it is not typically a quiet environment.
unique | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the digital artist likes to modify a famous picture to make it different or distinct from the original. The word "unique" expresses this idea best. "Creation" and "new" are too broad and do not suggest the act of modification. "Soft copy" and "paste" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Europe | Knowledge: The term "colonial kingdoms" suggests that the question is referring to the historical period of European colonization. Europe was the main continent from which colonial powers originated and launched their expeditions around the world. Saudi Arabia and the United States were not major world powers during the era of European colonization, and "book" and "monarchy" are not viable answers as they are not geographical locations.
forgetfulness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman is experiencing memory problems, and the specific sign being mentioned is related to short-term memory. The term "forgetfulness" directly relates to the context of the sentence, as it describes the inability to remember or recall information. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
yell at | Knowledge: The sentence clearly indicates that the mother is punishing her children, and raising her voice suggests that she is expressing anger or frustration at them. In this context, "yell at" is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Court system" and "authoritarian" do not fit the context because there is no mention of legal proceedings or extreme control. "Ignore" and "avoid" are also unlikely because the mother is actively punishing her children.
fight enemy | Knowledge: The context of the sentence is related to war, which often involves conflict and violence. "Make friend" and "change society" do not align with the context, as they do not involve direct action towards another person in a war. "Conquer opponent" is related to the idea of defeating or winning against someone in a war, but it does not necessarily involve direct physical conflict. "Kill" is a harsh reality of war and aligns with the context of having to harm another person in a violent situation. Therefore, "fight enemy" is the most appropriate answer.
learn to fly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bird is still in the process of developing and needs to accomplish a certain task to advance. Learning to fly is a crucial milestone for birds as it allows them to leave the nest and explore their surroundings. While spreading its wings and squawking may be some of the activities the bird engages in, they are not specifically mentioned as necessary for the bird to move on. Catching food is also important but not necessarily related to the bird's developmental milestone of learning to fly.
fort | Knowledge: Cannons are traditionally associated with fortifications or other strongholds on land, where they were used for defensive purposes. While cannons may also be associated with battles or war museums, these options are less specific to a particular location on land. Pirate ships might also have cannons, but they would be primarily used for attacking other ships rather than for fortifications. Paying debts does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
airport | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place where a human can be lifted and carried off, which is a description of an airport where planes take off and land. The other options do not fit the context of the question.
play games | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that kids have the ability to take anything and use it in a way that relates to playing games. This implies that kids have a creative imagination and are capable of using their surroundings to engage in imaginative play. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not reflect the idea of using anything to play games.
carnival | Knowledge: The description of a happy person drinking a lemonade suggests that they are likely at a social or recreational event, such as a fairgrounds, concert, or carnival. However, the fact that they are also feeling nauseous or dizzy indicates that they may have consumed something that has made them ill. Given that carnivals often have a variety of food and drink options, it is possible that the person may have consumed something that has caused their symptoms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
having fun | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Jane didn't care about socializing with others, but still went dancing. This suggests that she went to dance for her own enjoyment and pleasure, rather than to meet people or impress them. The option "having fun" is in line with this interpretation, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
toy store | Knowledge: The question asks where to buy a game, and the choices given all suggest different types of places. A casino is known for gambling games, a playground is for outdoor play equipment, an arcade typically has video games, and a family room is a private space in a home. Therefore, the correct answer must be a place where games are sold. A toy store is a place where a variety of games are sold, including board games, card games, and puzzles, making it the most likely correct answer.
determination | Knowledge: The sentence implies that achieving an advantage in something is not easy, and requires effort. The other options might be helpful in some contexts, but determination is the most generally applicable choice since effort and perseverance are commonly associated with achieving an advantage in something. Timing, skill, and having an upper hand can all be important factors as well, but without determination, success is unlikely.
laziness | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man has a lot to do but is still choosing to watch television instead. This suggests that his problem is related to motivation, rather than physical strain or boredom. The choice of "laziness" aligns with this idea, as it implies that the man lacks the drive to complete his tasks and is instead opting for an easier, more passive activity. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the implied tone of the statement.
tensions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that bringing a lawsuit against a family member will have some negative consequence with the rest of the family. The choice "peace" is unlikely because lawsuits usually create conflict, not resolution. "Aggravation" and "randomness" are not specific enough and do not fit well with the context of the sentence. "Verdict" refers to a legal decision, but it is not relevant to the question since the sentence is talking about the emotional impact of a lawsuit in a family. "Tensions" is the best answer because it accurately reflects the likely outcome of a lawsuit between family members.
Jewish community | Knowledge: The question is referring to a specific religious group in the Old Testament (Judaism) and their place of worship (the temple). The Jewish community is known for their beliefs and practices in the Old Testament, and the temple in Jerusalem is a central location for their worship. The other options either do not pertain to the specific religious group being referenced or are too general to be the correct answer.
soccer game | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a goalie, which is a position in soccer. It also mentions blocking a ball, which is a common action in soccer. The mention of blood on his face suggests that the ball was kicked with force, which is also common in soccer. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
outdoors | Knowledge: Ferrets are known for being active and curious animals, and they thrive in a setting that provides them with plenty of space to explore and play. While a classroom or a specific location like North Carolina or Great Britain may offer some opportunities for a ferret to explore, the most expansive and natural environment for a ferret to feel free would be the great outdoors. Therefore, the correct answer is outdoors.
switch on | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was unable to turn on the television because they could not find the remote. The phrase "manually" suggests that there may be another way to turn on the television, which would be a physical switch or button. The option "plug in" does not make sense in this context because the sentence does not mention anything about needing to connect the TV to an electrical outlet. The other options, "kill", "open eyes", and "watch TV" do not fit the context of the situation.
card room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the table was specifically designed for gambling, which implies that it should be placed in a location where gambling activities might take place. A card room is a common location for playing cards and other games involving gambling, so it is the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to gambling or gaming activities.
blind | Knowledge: The question implies that the person did not perceive the sharp object falling, which suggests that they have a visual impairment or inability to see. "Blind" is the only option that directly relates to this context, while the other choices focus on different types of characteristics or behaviors that do not necessarily relate to vision.
toy store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally's father took her to a place where they could pick out a stuffed animal, which is most commonly found in toy stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
better himself | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the focus is on actions that are taken to improve oneself. The phrase "better himself" directly reflects this idea and suggests that the person is taking intentional steps to make progress in some area of their life. While the other options may be important for personal growth (e.g. sleep and keeping an open mind), they do not necessarily involve actively working on self-improvement. "Think and reason" and "think critically" may be part of the process of self-improvement, but they are not specific enough to be the correct answer in this context.
get comfortable | Knowledge: The scenario suggests that the problem is not with the act of going to bed, but with staying asleep once in bed. The sentence also indicates that the person is tossing and turning, which implies that they are physically uncomfortable. Therefore, the person may need to adjust their position, change their pillow, or add extra blankets to get comfortable and improve their chances of falling asleep. The other options do not address the issue of physical discomfort, which is the likely cause of the person's sleeping troubles.
present | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's mind is not focused on their current physical location, which means that they are physically present but mentally elsewhere. Therefore, the correct answer should be "present." The other options do not accurately reflect the definition of the sentence. "There" and "being here" suggest that the person's mind is present, which is not the case. "At home" and "home team" have no relevance to the context of the sentence.
controversy | Knowledge: The word "not everyone agrees with" suggests that the art in question may be controversial or divisive. Creating controversial art can lead to disagreement or even outright conflict between those who support and those who critique it. This can result in public discourse, media coverage, and even legal action, depending on the severity of controversy. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential consequences of creating art that is not universally appreciated.
river or stream | Knowledge: Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water in order to create a habitat for themselves. The options "Canada" and "Montana" may be misleading because they are locations where beavers are commonly found, but it does not necessarily mean that they build dams there. "Kentucky" and "desert" are not suitable habitats for beavers as they require access to water to build their dams. Therefore, the correct answer is "river or stream."
motion sickness | Knowledge: The word "hazards" implies that there are risks or dangers associated with traveling. "Queasiness" and "diarrhea" may also be unpleasant side effects of traveling, but they are specific health issues and not hazards. "Exhilarating" and "going somewhere" are not negative or dangerous consequences associated with traveling. However, "motion sickness" is a common hazard that some people experience when traveling, especially in cars, boats, or planes.
further education | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the subject is seeking something related to their desire to attend college. "Further education" is the only option that is directly related to this context, as attending college typically involves pursuing higher education. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the answer.
hostility | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two sides are in conflict and have an intense negative feeling towards each other. Hostility is a common term used to describe this type of negative feeling. The other options (turmoil, fights, fighting, love and understanding) do not accurately capture the tone and context of the sentence. Turmoil & fights are too broad, love and understanding are the opposite of what is being described while fighting is a verb, not a noun.
fruit | Knowledge: The question asks what is healthy to eat the skin of. Fruits are often recommended to be eaten with the skin on as it contains important nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. However, not all fruits' skin is safe for consumption, and some may need to be peeled before eating. The other options are not related to the context of the question.
hand shake | Knowledge: Hand shaking is a common gesture used when meeting someone for the first time in many cultures. It is a sign of respect and a way to show good intentions. The other options do not involve physical interaction and are not typical gestures used when meeting new people.
write notes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John needs to practice writing, so his teacher recommends that he start with something small and manageable like writing notes. Writing notes can help him work on his writing skills without the pressure of creating a larger piece of writing like a novel or poem. The other options are either too advanced for someone who is a terrible writer, or not relevant to the context of the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the person is looking for a portable option to carry a pencil. The other options, such as a cup, desk drawer, desktop, or university, do not make sense as methods for carrying a pencil on one's person. A pocket, on the other hand, is a common and convenient option for carrying small items like pens and pencils.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John had his appointment book with him when he got a medical checkup, so it is logical to assume that he would have kept it on his person, such as in his pocket, rather than leaving it somewhere else like a handbag or wallet. Additionally, the other options, such as an office supply store or doctor's office, are unlikely places for John to search for his lost appointment book.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of seeing someone open a gift after buying Christmas presents causes a specific emotion for the gift giver. The word "pleasure" implies that the gift giver feels happy and satisfied to see the recipient enjoying the gift they carefully chose. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as "stress" and "debt" are negative emotions associated with gift-giving, while "understand themselves" is unrelated to the act of giving a gift. "Sense of joy" is similar, but may not necessarily be connected to gift-giving specifically.
for free | Knowledge: The phrase "no cost" indicates that the thing being received does not require payment. The option "for free" is a commonly used phrase to describe something received without cost. The other options - retail markup, revenue, income, and benefit - imply some sort of exchange of money or value, which is not indicated in the question.
potential | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trainer saw something positive in their client despite their disability. The word "disregarded" implies that the trainer did not focus on the disability and instead saw something else. The word "potential" suggests that the trainer may have seen the client's abilities and what they could achieve in the future with proper training. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
revised | Knowledge: The question is asking for the specific term used when you make changes to a contract. "Revised" is the correct answer because it refers to a modified version of an original document. "Signed" means to put your signature on a document, "folded" means to bend or crease a document, "written on paper" is too general and not specific to the context of a contract, and "rejected" means the contract was not accepted, but does not refer to changing the contract itself.
cassettes | Knowledge: The question is asking for a device or medium used for playing music. Out of the given choices, cassettes are the only one that can be physically played on a cassette player or recorder. Opera, movie, and theatre are types of performances, while elevators do have music playing but do not require the user to bring anything to play music.
betrayal of trust | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that one friend has developed a habit of lying, which has negatively impacted their relationship with the other friend. The phrase "betrayal of trust" implies that the other friend no longer feels they can rely on the liar, and this has damaged the foundation of their friendship. The other options do not accurately describe the situation described in the sentence.
oils | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sally has an interest in hair, but not in cutting it. The phrase "rub some every single day" implies that she is looking for a product that she can apply to hair. The option "oils" makes sense as a choice because there are many types of hair oils that can be used for various purposes, such as moisturizing or styling. The other options do not make as much sense within the context of the sentence.
class | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker needs more knowledge, which is commonly acquired through education. The word "truancy" implies that the speaker has a history of skipping or missing school, which means they need to go to more classes in order to improve their knowledge. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dentist | Knowledge: To find a dental office, the most important thing to look for is a dentist who provides dental services. The other options listed might be helpful information to have when searching for a specific dental office, but they are not the essential factor in finding a dental office. The street or city would give you the location of the office, the office building might be where the office is located, and the town might indicate the general area where the office is located, but the presence of a dentist who offers dental services is the critical piece of information needed to find a dental office.
desk drawer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the hiring agent had immediate access to a contract and pen during the interview, which suggests that they were already prepared beforehand. The most likely place for someone in that situation to keep such supplies would be in a desk drawer near their workspace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feel loved | Knowledge: The question is asking for what people want to feel more than anything, so the answer should be something universally desired. Feeling appreciated or laughing out loud are positive emotions, but they may not be the most important to everyone. Hurrying home and thanking god are specific actions or expressions of gratitude, but they don't address the emotional aspect of the question. Feeling loved, on the other hand, is something that most people crave and value deeply, regardless of cultural or personal differences.
residential area | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is wandering outside, which means it is likely to be found in a residential or outdoor area rather than inside a house. The other choices are related to indoor locations and comfort, which do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
very loyal | Knowledge: Dogs are known for their loyalty to their owners, making them popular as pets. While dogs can also be smart and friendly, these traits are not generally used to describe dogs as a whole. "Found outside" and "furry" are not traits that describe a dog's behavior towards people at all.
light and heat | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that all energy on earth comes from the sun, which suggests that the correct answer should be related to some form of energy that the sun produces. Two choices, "light" and "heat," are directly related to the energy produced by the sun, as sunlight consists of both light and heat. "Lightning" is not related to the sun, as it is a form of electric discharge in the atmosphere. "Life on earth" and "sun tan" are not related to energy production.
house | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the homeowner wanted new flooring installed in their home, which makes "house" the appropriate answer. The other options do not refer to a specific location within the context of the sentence. "Home Depot" is a store where one might purchase flooring, but it is not a specific location in the home. "Bundle" does not refer to a location at all, while "mansion" and "loft" are types of homes but do not specify where in the home the flooring is to be installed.
parking lot | Knowledge: A parking lot is a designated area for leaving cars in public, while the other options are not necessarily appropriate for leaving a car unattended. A race track, for example, is a place for racing cars and not for parking, while the market place is typically busy and crowded, making it difficult to find a safe and secure parking spot. Similarly, a repair shop is not designed for public parking, and the city is too broad of a location to offer any specific parking guidance.
make mistakes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer pertains to a unique ability that only humans have. While other animals can hear sounds, drive cars (as they cannot operate them), reproduce, and excrete, only humans possess the ability to make mistakes. Making mistakes is a characteristic of human behavior and is often associated with learning and growth. The other options are not exclusive to humans as other animals and living organisms can perform these actions.
sidewalk | Knowledge: The use of a turn signal suggests that the car was likely parked on the side of the road. The only option related to a side of the road is the sidewalk, which is where cars may park temporarily with their turn signal on. The other choices do not have a clear relationship with the context of the sentence.
wet clothes | Knowledge: The question implies that if you don't have an umbrella, rain can have a negative impact on you. The choice "wet clothes" is the most likely answer since rain can saturate your clothing when you're without protection. The other options, such as "tickle" and "water garden," don't make sense given the context of the question.
polite | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason for leaving the restaurant was related to the behavior of the person at the front, and specifically their lack of politeness. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated (drinking wine), or do not correspond to a negative behavior that would cause someone to leave a restaurant (making reservations, prepared to pay). Spit on me is an extreme negative behavior.
sparse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the area being described does not have a lot of resources. The word "sparse" means "thinly dispersed or scattered" and is often used when describing something that is not abundant. The other options do not convey the same meaning and do not fit the context of the sentence.
court case | Knowledge: A civil action typically involves taking legal action against someone or something (such as a company or organization) in a court of law. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to involve legal procedures or processes. "Disobedience" and "anger" do not make sense in the context of taking legal action, while "complications" does not provide a specific action to take. "Trial" is a possibility, but it is more specific and refers to the formal process of presenting evidence and arguments in a court of law, whereas "court case" is a broader term that encompasses all legal proceedings related to a civil dispute.
prepare food | Knowledge: The question is asking about the primary duty of a chef, which is the most important task they are responsible for. Chefs are primarily responsible for preparing food, which involves a wide range of tasks such as selecting ingredients, chopping and slicing vegetables and meats, cooking food to specific temperatures, and presenting dishes in an appealing way. While studying French cooking and creating thin sauces may be part of a chef's training, these tasks are not their primary duty. "Manual" is too vague and doesn't give any context, and "cook dinner" is too specific and doesn't cover all the tasks a chef may be responsible for.
processed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to eat more simply, which often means avoiding processed foods that contain a lot of additives and preservatives. On the other hand, ripe and yellow are just descriptors of the color of foods and don't really connect to the idea of eating more simply. Greenweed is not a commonly known food, and cloy means overly sweet or rich, which also doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
backyard | Knowledge: Personal apple trees are typically planted in private, residential areas such as backyards. This is because they require regular care and attention, and are often used for personal consumption rather than commercial purposes. The other answer choices do not align with the context of a personal apple tree, as they are either too general (Wisconsin, countryside, fields) or too public (front yard).
leave | Knowledge: "Cashing in your chips" is a phrase commonly used in casinos to indicate exchanging your chips (currency used in casinos) for cash. Therefore, the question is asking what you would do after receiving your cash winnings. The most appropriate answer is "leave" since it implies that you will be exiting the casino after successfully cashing in your chips. The other options do not make sense in this context.
virtuous | Knowledge: The word "unpleasant" is missing from the question, making it a bit tricky. To answer the question, we need to consider which word describes something that is unlikely to be bad or unpleasant. "Exceptional" could go either way - it could be positive or negative depending on the context. "Advantageous" and "sufficient" can also be good or bad depending on the situation. "Strength" could be bad if it leads to arrogance or negative behavior. "Virtuous," on the other hand, is almost always considered a positive trait, and unlikely to be seen as something bad.
enjoy nature | Knowledge: Hiking is a popular activity for people who enjoy being outdoors and surrounded by nature. It offers a chance to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life and immerse oneself in the beauty and tranquility of natural surroundings. While staying hydrated by drinking water is important during a hike, it is not the main reason people go hiking. Getting lost and getting tired are risks associated with hiking, but they are not typically the goals of the activity. Hunger may be a consideration, but it is not the reason people choose to go hiking.
tickets | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam put his "return ticket" in a special box. This suggests that he had other tickets that he also kept in the box, which makes "tickets" a likely option. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as well. An "airline envelope" could be a possibility, but it is not clear why Sam would keep all of his possessions in it, and the sentence does not mention any other items stored in the special box. "Airport" and "plane" do not make sense because Sam would not keep all of his possessions in these locations. "Keepsakes" is possible, but there is no clear indication that the special box was reserved for mementos or sentimental items.
baseball bat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being held by the handle is something that can be used for a public performance or display, since many people are watching. The phrase "grasping things" is too general and could apply to many different objects. Holding a door by the handle wouldn't involve any kind of performance or display. A watering can or coffeepot might be held by the handle, but they're not typically objects that would be used for public display or performance. A baseball bat, on the other hand, is often used in a public game or performance, and would be held by the handle during use.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Jill is in a shopping complex in Ann Arbor, which is a city in the state of Michigan. The other options do not have any relevance to the sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. Choosing the correct answer requires basic knowledge of geography and an understanding of the context of the sentence.
bedroom | Knowledge: Birth control pills are typically taken at home, which suggests that the correct answer is likely to be a location where one might keep their medication at home. The other options include retail locations where one might purchase birth control pills, or spaces where a person might carry their medication with them, but these choices are less likely to be the correct answer based on the context given. The bedroom is a logical choice for where a person might take their birth control pill, as it is typically a private and comfortable space where one might feel most at ease when taking medication.
foreign | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person prefers to shop locally, which implies that they prioritize supporting local businesses and products. The opposite of local would be foreign, as products from other countries are not considered part of the local economy. The other options are not necessarily opposite to the concept of shopping local and do not fit the context of the sentence.
exhaustion | Knowledge: Exercise can often lead to feelings of tiredness and soreness, but exhaustion is a more extreme form of fatigue that can occur after prolonged physical activity. Three hours is a significant amount of time to exercise without a break, which increases the likelihood of experiencing exhaustion. Muscle growth and soreness are also possible outcomes of exercise, but they do not necessarily indicate the severity of the girl's condition. Pain may also be a symptom of overexertion, but it is not as specific to the context of the given sentence.
stock market | Knowledge: The sentence gives clues about what Jim was interested in and what he wasn't interested in. It states that he didn't like physical labor or dealing with people, which suggests that he may have been looking for a less hands-on, more individual pursuit. The phrase "make a fortune" implies that he was interested in investments or financial gain. The option "stock market" fits both of these criteria and is the most likely answer. The other options - cookie, real estate, treasure chest, and treasure hunting - are not typically associated with making a fortune through investments or financial gain.
pocket | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person being asked is a man and therefore would likely use pockets to store their change. Purses are typically associated with women, and jars and wallets are not convenient options for storing loose change if you plan to use it soon. The backseat of a car is also not a practical option for storing change that you plan to use on the go.
prior knowledge of | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering something involves referencing something that you already have. This is commonly referred to as prior knowledge, or information that you have already learned and stored in your memory. The other options, such as memory cells and brain cells, are not accurate descriptions of the process of remembering. Nerve cells may be involved in the transmission of information, but they do not necessarily represent the information itself.
bounce | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the ball is highly elastic, which means that it is able to quickly spring back to its original shape after being compressed or stretched. This property is commonly associated with bouncing, which involves a rapid upward movement after hitting a surface. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of an elastic ball.
falling down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person lost their balance while roller skating and couldn't recover, which commonly results in falling down. The other options are not logical outcomes of losing balance while roller skating. Option "injury" could be a result of falling down, but it doesn't necessarily happen every time. Option "hit people" doesn't relate to the context at all while option "move fast" is irrelevant.
dreams | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person has a vivid imagination that affects their sleep, suggesting they have adventurous and intense dreams. Nightmares and death are possibilities, but the sentence uses the word "wild" to describe the characteristic, which better fits with dreams. The option "when I have a nightmare" is a sentence fragment and not a valid choice. Erections are not related to the context of the sentence.
cage | Knowledge: Lemurs are wild animals and are typically kept in captivity in zoos or animal parks. They are usually kept in large cages or enclosures that mimic their natural habitat as closely as possible. The other options, such as a bank or a hole, have no connection to the context of the question and are unlikely places for a lemur to be kept.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is considering where to install a spa, and the most appropriate location would be in a space that provides privacy and accessibility. A backyard is commonly associated with providing privacy and convenience, which would make it the most likely choice for a spa installation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or imply a lack of privacy.
raise crops | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer has a goal related to agriculture. The phrase "raise crops" specifically implies that the farmer's main objective is to grow plants for food or other purposes. The other options, such as "farm land" and "beer cans," do not seem like plausible goals for a farmer, and "can produce" and "seed plants" are too vague to be the main goal.
slender | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker's friends prefer girls who are "thick," which likely refers to a curvy or voluptuous body type. In contrast, the speaker prefers girls who are "healthy but slender," indicating that they prefer a thinner, more toned body type. The word "slender" specifically denotes a thin and graceful build without any excess fat or bulk, which aligns with the speaker's preference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
meditate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when people are in a state of trance and need to calm themselves, they engage in a specific action. Out of the given choices, meditating is the most appropriate answer as it involves focusing on one's breath and inner thoughts in order to reduce stress and promote relaxation. The other options - running, confusion, epilepsy, and hallucination - do not align with the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect.
drunk driving | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about how a person can destroy a car after becoming inebriated, and one of the most common ways that this happens is through drunk driving. Drunk driving involves operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, which impairs a person's ability to react quickly, make good decisions, and perform complex tasks like driving. Being high on drugs or simply being in a state of drunkenness may not necessarily lead to destruction of a car, while talking nonsense is not directly related to destroying a car. Automobile accidents may be a result of drunk driving, but not necessarily the only way to destroy a car while inebriated.
intoxication | Knowledge: Being drunk typically leads to a state of intoxication, which is marked by impaired judgment, difficulty in moving or speaking, and altered perceptions of reality. While some individuals may experience other physical or emotional changes as a result of drinking, such as having an erection or feeling sick, intoxication is the most likely and immediate outcome of consuming too much alcohol. Death is also a possibility but is less common as a direct result of drinking, and hangovers are a delayed effect that occurs after intoxication has subsided.
play | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mable has a fondness for horses, which is unlikely to be expressed through activities like cleaning or dominating them. Eating grass is something that horses do, not people. Kept in barn stalls is a description of where the horses are housed, not an activity that Mable would engage in. This leaves playing with the horses as the most logical option, since it's a common way for people to interact with animals they enjoy being around.
pocket | Knowledge: Kleenex is a brand of tissue paper that is commonly used for wiping one's nose or face. The sentence suggests that the person is carrying a tissue paper in their pants, which is likely to be kept in a pocket as it is the most convenient and accessible place to store small items. The other options such as a box, purse, or bag are not typically associated with keeping a single tissue paper. "Blow nose" is an action that one may do with a Kleenex, but it is not a location.
learn to swim | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person wants to emulate Michael Phelps, who is a highly successful swimmer. Learning to swim would be the first step towards achieving this goal. Crossing the street, feeling relieved, or acting responsibly are not relevant actions in this scenario. Avoiding swimming would also contradict the person's desire to be like Michael Phelps.
press conference | Knowledge: A press conference is a common event for a president to meet others, such as reporters or other political leaders. It is a forum for the president to share information and answer questions, making it a likely place for interaction with others. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they are not related to meeting others in a professional or political setting.
rocky hillside | Knowledge: The sentence implies that marmots have a unique ability to maneuver in high places thanks to their hands, which suggests that they are adapted to living in rocky areas. The option "rocky hillside" makes the most sense because it specifically references the type of terrain that marmots are likely to inhabit. The other options - outside, hill, jungle, and tree - do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide any indication of what marmots might climb using their hands.
heartache | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a situation where there is unrequited love, meaning one person loves the other but the feeling is not mutual. This can cause heartache, which is a feeling of emotional pain and sadness. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response to unrequited love.
hardware store | Knowledge: A pail, nails, and a hammer are all tools commonly used for home improvement or DIY projects. The context suggests that the person is looking to purchase these items, and the most likely place to find them all together would be a hardware store. The other options do not typically carry a wide range of tools and hardware.
It depends on the context and intended use of the paper, there is no one correct answer in this case.
four legs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lizards use a specific method for achieving locomotion, and the most common method among lizards is through the use of four legs. This is a general characteristic of reptiles, which typically have four limbs for walking and crawling. The other options do not describe a method of locomotion. Bones, backbone, and tail are all parts of the lizard's body, but they don't necessarily relate to how the lizard moves. Changing the color of the skin is a form of camouflage and does not necessarily have anything to do with locomotion.
milky way galaxy | Knowledge: The options are all physical locations, but the Milky Way Galaxy, being a massive collection of stars and celestial bodies, is not a place where a terrestrial animal like a cat could exist. The other options are all places where a cat could potentially be found, with varying degrees of likelihood.
soccer stadium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a court in the center of the seating area, which is a characteristic commonly associated with sports stadiums. Seats in rows surrounding a court would be typical for a game like soccer, basketball, or tennis, which all have a court or field in the center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pass course | Knowledge: The question mentions that the student is failing, which implies that they are not passing the course. Therefore, the goal should be to pass the course by improving their grades. The other options may be helpful study strategies, but they do not address the main issue of the student failing the course.
burrow | Knowledge: Marmosets are small primates that live in trees and do not typically burrow or live underground. Therefore, it is logical that they would be unable to breathe in a burrow or underground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gain weight | Knowledge: Bodybuilders typically eat large amounts of food in order to gain weight and muscle mass. They need to consume a surplus of calories to support their intensive workouts and promote muscle growth. The other options, such as "pleasant conversation" and "sounds of digestion", do not make sense in the context of why a bodybuilder would eat so much. "Store food for winter" is not relevant to a human body and "satisfy hunger" suggests a normal level of eating, not excessive consumption associated with bodybuilders.
fold them | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the clothes are already clean, which rules out the options "soap" and "launder." The word "fold" suggests that the clothes are being put away, which makes sense in the context of taking them out of the dryer. "Take off" does not make sense in this context, and "sort" may be necessary before washing the clothes, but not after they have already been cleaned.
reproduce | Knowledge: Reproduction is the primary biological function of sexual intercourse, as it allows for the creation of offspring. Compliments, sweating, talented, and affluent have no clear connection to the biological function of sex.
snore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while resting, a person is doing something that affects other people. Lying down, falling asleep, and time passing are all common activities while resting but do not have a direct impact on other people. Snoring, however, can affect other people's sleep or cause disturbance, making it the correct answer. "Loud" can also be a correct answer as it suggests a noisy activity that could disturb others, but it is less specific than snoring.
large company | Knowledge: Shareholders own a portion of a company's stock, which represents a share of ownership in that company. This means that they have a financial interest and a stake in the company's success or failure. The other options - building, headache, financial trouble, and factory - do not accurately represent what a shareholder owns in a company.
speaking english | Knowledge: Canada is a country that has two official languages: English and French. However, English is spoken by the majority of the population, so it is likely that most people in Canada will speak English to converse. The other options, such as speaking in tongues or watering plants, are not related to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated.
rain forest | Knowledge: Lemurs are native to Madagascar, which is known for its diverse rainforest habitats. While Australia and India have their own unique ecosystems, they are not typically associated with lemur habitats. Similarly, while some lemurs may live in captivity in a cage, that is not the natural environment for these animals. Finally, while there are many different types of forests around the world, the reference to lemurs in the question suggests that the correct answer is likely the rainforest, which is a well-known habitat for many different types of primates.
get out of bed | Knowledge: The question is asking about the first step someone would take in returning to work one day, suggesting that the person is currently not at work (perhaps on a day off or holiday). Getting out of bed is the logical first step in preparing to go to work, as it is necessary to physically leave the bed and start the day. The other options are either not relevant to the question or come after the initial step of getting out of bed.
pleasure | Knowledge: Many people create art for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings them. Creating art can be a pleasurable and rewarding experience, which is why pleasure would be a positive effect of creating art. While art can sometimes generate controversy or facilitate communication, these are not necessarily positive effects in and of themselves. Heart and pride are also not typically regarded as positive effects of creating art in the general sense.
summer | Knowledge: Electric storms or thunderstorms are most likely to occur during the summer season when there is a higher likelihood of warm and humid air masses, which is a favorable condition for the formation of thunderstorms. The other choices do not provide any relevant information about the likelihood of electric storms.
room | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is related to hosting guests in a house. When unexpected guests arrive and there is not enough seating available, it is common to bring out folding chairs to accommodate everyone. In a house, the most appropriate place to put additional chairs would be in a room where guests can gather and socialize, such as a living room or dining room. The other options listed, such as an auditorium, ocean, church, or garage, are unlikely to be relevant or appropriate in this context.
hear sounds | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a good musician has an exceptional ability to perceive sounds beyond the normal range of hearing or attention. This is a quality commonly associated with musical talent and may be essential for a musician to create complex arrangements and harmonies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the idea of heightened sensory perception.
front door | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is making a decision about entering or leaving a space that has a door, which likely refers to the front door of a house or building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bag | Knowledge: If the person does not have a shirt pocket to carry the sunglasses, the next logical choice would be to store them in a bag or purse. The other options do not make as much sense - putting them in shoes would be uncomfortable and potentially damaging to the sunglasses, storing them in a drugstore is not relevant to the question, and the glove compartment is not a portable solution if the person wants to bring the sunglasses with them.
museum | Knowledge: Gift shops in museums often sell replicas of paintings as part of their merchandise. Museums typically display a large number of paintings, so it makes sense that they would offer visitors the opportunity to take home a reproduction of a favorite artwork. The other options may have gift shops, but they are less likely to sell replicas of paintings. For example, while Disney and hotels may sell souvenirs, they are not typically focused on art replicas.
death and | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taxes are an unavoidable part of life, as indicated by the phrase "taxes are inevitable." The phrase "death and taxes" is a common expression, meaning that just as death is certain, so are taxes. None of the other options are commonly associated with taxes or the context of the sentence.
populated area | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location that is not suitable for a cemetery. A populated area would not be an appropriate location for a cemetery due to potential health and environmental concerns. Cemetery locations should be chosen carefully to ensure that they do not pose any risks to public health or the environment. The other options may be suitable for cemetery locations depending on various factors, such as the size of the area, the local laws and regulations, and the cultural practices of the community.
repair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Wendy's toy is damaged in some way, and that she believes she can fix it. The other options do not relate to repairing or fixing something that is broken. "Raise" or "make" are not appropriate in this context because they suggest creating something new, while "reincarnate" refers to the idea of coming back to life after death, which does not apply here. "Build" also suggests creating something new, rather than fixing something that already exists.
national park | Knowledge: The word "protected" suggests that the forest is under some form of conservation or government regulation. The most likely place to find a protected forest is within a designated national park, where many natural resources are preserved and protected. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to protected forests. The temperate zone refers to a specific climate region, South Africa is a country, the countryside refers to rural areas in general, and the Amazon basin is a specific geographic region.
dictionary | Knowledge: A dictionary is specifically designed to provide the meanings of words. An encyclopedia contains more general information on a wide range of topics, and a sentence or phrase may contain the word but does not necessarily define it. Language refers to a system of communication, not a specific reference book.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boxes of toys were put in long term storage, which is commonly found in a basement. Basements are often used for storage as they are a cool, dry place that is out of the way. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
toy shop or toy store | Knowledge: A yoyo is a commonly sold toy and can be found in stores that specialize in selling toys. A toy shop or toy store would likely have yoyos available for purchase. The other options are less likely places to find a yoyo, unless it has already been purchased and brought there.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the mother needed to put away a plate, which is a common item found in a kitchen. The options of flea market, museum, and restaurant do not make logical sense since they are not locations where someone would typically store a plate. The option of dishwasher is a possibility, but the sentence does not give any indication that the mother specifically put the plate in the dishwasher. Therefore, the most logical choice is the kitchen cupboard, where plates are commonly stored.
sorrow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone's relative committed suicide, which is often a tragic and deeply painful experience for the family and loved ones left behind. "Sorrow" is a synonym for grief or sadness, and it is a reasonable answer to the question based on the context of the sentence. "Uncomfortable," "harm to others," "being dead," and "death" are all possible emotions or outcomes that might be associated with suicide, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
during a fight | Knowledge: The phrase "more than a drop of blood" implies a violent or physical altercation where bloodshed is expected. The other options do not suggest a scenario where blood spillage is likely, except for maybe a needle if someone is receiving a medical injection, but the phrase "more than a drop" makes that option less likely. "Battlefield" could be a contender but the question only asks for one drop, which is not indicative of a battlefield where large-scale violence occurs. "Person" and "test tube" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
tool shed | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the saw is not needed immediately but will be needed in the future. It also states that the house has only one floor, which suggests that there is no basement. Putting the saw in a logging camp or in a vehicle does not make sense since these are not typical locations where one would store tools. The most logical choice is a tool shed, which is a common location for storing tools and equipment. The toolbox is also a possible choice, but the question specifies that the saw will not be needed soon, so it may be too small to hold a saw.
take pictures | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a way to share memories of visiting a museum, which suggests a method for recording the memories. Taking pictures is a common way to capture memories, especially of places like museums. The other options (crying, talking loudly, whispering, entertainment) do not relate to recording or sharing memories in a meaningful way.
New Hampshire | Knowledge: The question explicitly states that the horse should be from New England, which is a region in the northeastern United States consisting of six states, including Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Of the options provided, only New Hampshire is located in New England, making it the correct answer. Kentucky and Canada are not in the New England region, while engraving is not a state and has no relevance to the question.
enjoyment | Knowledge: Listening to music is often associated with pleasure and entertainment. People may listen to music to relax, uplift their mood, or enjoy the emotional and artistic expression conveyed through the music. While music can also be used for dancing, keeping time, or learning (such as in music education), these purposes are not necessarily the primary reason someone would listen to music. Profit is also not a common reason for listening to music, as most listeners do not directly profit from listening to music.
ship's hold | Knowledge: Since the sentence mentions transporting cargo by sea, the logical choice is a ship. The term "ship's hold" refers to the area of the ship where cargo is stored during transportation. The other options, such as boat, bus, aeroplane, and airplane, are not typically used to transport large quantities of cargo across long distances, making "ship's hold" the correct answer.
loose | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the instructor was teaching the students about keeping everything tied tight, which suggests a focus on precision and control. The word "loose" is the opposite of those concepts, and therefore makes sense as something that the instructor did not want to see. The other options do not fit the context as well - "baggy" and "broad" describe clothing or shapes, "gas" is unrelated to the concept of tying things, and "slack" could be a synonym for loose but is less commonly used in this context.
great relief | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Marna did something wrong and confessed it to Billy. Since Billy is described as a forgiving person, it can be inferred that he responded positively to the confession. The fact that Marna felt relief indicates that she was worried about how Billy would react, but his forgiveness put her at ease. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
get comfortable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who is lazy would choose to watch TV because it allows them to get comfortable without putting in much effort. The other options are also reasons why someone might choose to watch TV, but they do not necessarily relate to laziness specifically. For example, someone might watch TV to be entertained or see their favorite show, but this does not necessarily mean they are lazy.
city | Knowledge: The phrase "got in the bus in Hell and got off at Christmas" suggests that the trip covered a distance or route, likely through a series of locations. The choices "big cities," "New York," "university," and "Michigan" all refer to specific places and do not fit the context of the sentence. "City" is a more general term that could refer to any urban area, making it the most appropriate choice given the information provided.
come early | Knowledge: The question is asking what a lawyer can do to engage a difficult-to-find witness, which implies that the witness is present but not easily accessible. Coming early would allow the lawyer to meet with the witness and discuss their testimony, potentially building a rapport and making them more willing to participate in the case. The other options do not relate to engaging a difficult-to-find witness. "State case" implies the lawyer is presenting their case to a judge or jury, which may not involve the witness at all. "Nullified" and "clear of all charges" suggest the case has already been resolved, which would not be relevant for engaging a witness. "Produce evidence" may be a part of engaging a witness, but it does not address the issue of difficulty in finding them.
kneel down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are doing something in addition to clasping their hands while praying. Kneeling down is a common posture for prayer in many religious traditions, making it the most likely answer. Whispering and talking to God are also common when praying, but they are not actions people do in addition to clasping their hands. Bowing may be a part of some prayer traditions, but it is not always done alongside clasping the hands. Asking for help is not necessarily an action that people physically do while praying.
special | Knowledge: The opposite of ordinary is something that is not common or average. Out of the given choices, special fits this definition the best as it implies a distinctiveness or uniqueness. The other options have connotations that suggest an even greater deviation from the norm, rather than just being uncommon. Strange, weird, and unbelievable all imply an element of shock or disbelief, while exceptional suggests something outstanding or extraordinary.
toolkit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John needs a tool to take off the blade of his lawnmower. A screwdriver is a common tool found in a toolkit or a tool belt, so these options would be the most likely places for John to look for his screwdriver. A handyman or a repair shop might have the tool, but it's not clear from the sentence whether John would need to go to those places or if he already has the tool. A bar would not be a typical place to find a screwdriver.
wherever | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the husband is accustomed to the wife typically selecting the place for dinner, so he is not used to making the decision himself. The word "wherever" suggests that he is open to any option and does not have a preference, but is leaving the decision up to his wife. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
space shuttle | Knowledge: Air is a mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth, but the amount of air is relatively thin (compared to other substances) in the atmosphere. Therefore, the option that provides the greatest amount of air is likely to be space shuttle, since outside the Earth's atmosphere, there is a vacuum and air is relatively less compressed, which would provide a larger volume of air per unit area compared to the Earth's surface, train stations, houses or parks.
funeral | Knowledge: The word "students" suggests that the place being referred to is a school or university. However, the fact that the auditorium is empty implies that the event being held there is not related to education or learning. Therefore, the most likely option is a funeral or memorial service, which may be held in a school or university auditorium if the deceased person had a connection to the institution. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
zoos | Knowledge: Zoos are commonly known as places where people go to see a variety of animals. State parks and gardens may have some animal exhibits, but they are not the primary focus of those places. Laboratories are usually used for scientific research and not for public viewing. The phrase "surface of earth" is too general and does not provide any context or specific information relevant to the question.
garden | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the rainwater collected in the container is being used for a non-potable purpose, like watering plants. This makes the most sense as a garden would require regular watering, while the other options are unlikely to require regular watering or may not have plants at all.
spending money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that obtaining lunch at a restaurant comes at a cost, which indicates that the result of this action is monetary. The other options are not necessarily linked to the act of obtaining lunch at a restaurant.
produce evidence | Knowledge: The discovery phase of a trial is when both parties exchange information and evidence that they plan to use in the trial. During this phase, lawyers are required to produce any evidence they have that supports their case. The other options do not relate to the discovery phase of a trial - lawyers may charge a fee for their services, but this is not specific to the discovery phase; coming early is not a requirement; convicting is the goal of the trial, not a requirement of the discovery phase; and stating the case is done during the trial itself, not the discovery phase.
momentum | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James struggled to begin his work, but once he did, he was able to work without stopping. This implies that he was able to build up momentum and work efficiently once he got started. Panic, stress, and anxiety are negative emotions that would likely hinder James' ability to work. Accomplishing is not a state of mind, but rather a result of successfully completing a task. Momentum is the only option that aligns with the context of the sentence and suggests a positive work mindset.
cage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place is not a natural habitat for a beaver to be free in, and the presence of a cage implies a form of captivity. Although beavers are commonly found in woodlands, they would still feel free in such an environment. Canada and Ontario both have large natural habitats where beavers are free to roam. A zoo is a clear example of captivity, but it is not specific to beavers and is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "cage."
telephone booth | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where a telephone is usually present. The options "library" and "house" do not have any clear connection to a specific location where a telephone is found. "Under chair" could suggest a random location where a phone book may or may not be present. "At hotel" is not specific enough and could refer to various locations within a hotel. "Telephone booth" is the best option because it is a specific location where a telephone is usually present along with a phone book for reference.
montana | Knowledge: The name "Gruber Excavation" does not provide any clear indication of where the company is located. However, the option "Montana" is a geographical location and could be a possible answer. Additional knowledge about the company's location, such as its website or other context in the question, would help to confirm whether Montana is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
nausea | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that prolonged tickling can cause dizziness and spinning, which are both common symptoms of vertigo. Vertigo can also cause nausea, making it the most likely option among the choices given. Vomiting and itchiness may also occur in some cases, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence. Laughing and giggling are not necessarily negative symptoms of tickling and are not related to the dizziness and spinning mentioned in the sentence.
church property | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that graveyards are commonly found in a specific location. The context of the sentence, "People die, that's why you tend to find a graveyard," implies that graveyards are built for a specific purpose related to death. Church property is a common location for graveyards because many churches historically provided burial services to their members. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
human body | Knowledge: The spine is a crucial part of the human body's skeletal system and is located in the back. While the lumbar refers to the lower back region, it is not the same as the spine itself. Books may have spines, but this is not relevant to the context of the question.
stress | Knowledge: Heavy traffic can be frustrating and anxiety-inducing, which suggests that the correct answer is stress. While transportation and getting somewhere are related to the act of driving, they do not describe an emotional state. Similarly, patient and relaxation are emotions that are unlikely to be associated with the experience of driving in heavy traffic.
match | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that a tennis game has started, which implies that the game is in progress or underway. Therefore, the correct answer would be "progress" or "match," as those options are related to the context of a tennis game. "Achievement" does not make sense, as it relates to success or accomplishment rather than the start of a game, and "park" and "field with tennis court" are not related to the sentence at all.
injury | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person got into an accident while drunk driving, which suggests they may have sustained some kind of physical harm or injury. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
landscaping | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described involves the care and upkeep of a specific type of plant (rosebushes) in an outdoor setting (a lawn). Landscaping is a term commonly used to refer to the design, installation, and maintenance of outdoor spaces, including gardens and lawns. Cooking, California, backyard, and courtyard do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
yard | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer should describe a part of a property that is located next to a driveway. A yard is a common feature of many properties and may be located next to a driveway to provide a buffer between the property and the street or to create a space for outdoor activities. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
building | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the disaster preparedness video is highlighting the importance of being aware of the materials that doors are made of in certain situations. This is likely in reference to situations such as building fires, where doors made of certain materials may be more or less likely to provide adequate protection. Restrooms, walls, apartments, and theaters are all locations where doors may be present, but they do not necessarily suggest any particular connection to disaster preparedness or the importance of door materials. However, the word "building" specifically implies a larger structure with multiple rooms and potential hazards, which would be a more likely setting for a disaster preparedness video to focus on.
live life | Knowledge: The sentence implies that love is used by some people to achieve or experience something positive for themselves. "Live life" is a common phrase that suggests enjoying or experiencing all that life has to offer, which fits with the idea of using love in a positive way. The other options do not fit with the positive connotation of using love for oneself.
derbyshire | Knowledge: Chesterfield is a type of sofa that originated in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England. Therefore, the best place to find a well-crafted chesterfield would be in Derbyshire, where the style originated. The other options (museum, living room, foyer) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
trust himself  | Knowledge: The question is asking for a personal opinion on how to make the right decision. "Trust himself" is an option that suggests one should rely on their own instincts and judgement, which is a common belief in decision-making. The other options do not directly relate to personal decision-making, such as "good looking" or "acknowledgment." "New experiences" and "questioning" may be valid approaches to decision-making, but they are not as universally accepted as trusting oneself.
complete high school | Knowledge: The sentence implies that at the age of 19 years, most people have completed a certain milestone. Going to jail or dying suddenly is not a common occurrence for individuals at the age of 19. While belief in God is a personal choice, it is not necessarily linked to age. Crossing a river may happen to some individuals at any age, but it is not a universal experience that applies to most people at 19 years of age. Therefore, the logical answer is completing high school, as this is a developmental milestone that is typically reached by the age of 19 years.
apartment complex | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a collection of small dwellings, which are typically found in an apartment complex. The parking area is also mentioned, which is common for apartment complexes to have. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pleasant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cuddling in bed after sex is a way to spend time with a loved one, which indicates a positive experience. The word "pleasant" is commonly used to describe enjoyable experiences, while "painful" suggests discomfort or suffering. "Adorable" does not seem appropriate in this context, while "dirty" has negative connotations. "Effect of insemination" does not make sense in this context.
am happy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a good time dancing, which is commonly associated with feelings of happiness and enjoyment. Saying "I am happy" after a good dance is a natural expression of this emotion. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
laboratory | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the scientists were working with preserved specimens that required cold storage. This suggests that the location being referred to is likely a laboratory, where scientific research is typically conducted. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as book stores and warehouses would not typically require cold storage, while refrigerators and freezers are too general to provide a clear answer.
store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John doesn't have time to cook, which implies that he is looking for pre-cooked or ready-to-cook potatoes. The most likely place to find such potatoes would be a store, where they can be purchased in various forms (e.g. fresh, frozen, pre-cooked, etc.). While restaurants may also serve baked potatoes, they are less likely to sell them for individuals to take home. A pantry and root cellar are places where food is stored, but they are unlikely to sell ready-to-cook potatoes. Casserole is a dish made with potatoes, but it is not a place where one can obtain them.
department store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the location is a place where people are carrying plastic bags, which is a typical occurrence at a department store. Parks may have people carrying bags, but it is unlikely to be the main activity observed in the sentence. Houses and own homes would not typically have a large number of people going in and out of the entryway. An office building may have people carrying bags, but it is not as common as at a department store.
whitehouse | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the subject is the president, suggesting that the location mentioned would be related to politics or government. The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, so it is the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
happy | Knowledge: The word "play" in this context suggests an activity that is enjoyable and fun. It is common for children to experience happiness and excitement when they play, which would be the logical answer. None of the other choices have an obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
hotel or motel | Knowledge: The question is looking for a place to stay, so the most likely options are hotel or motel, as these are establishments specifically designed for temporary lodging. The phone book might have listings for hotels and motels, but it also includes many other businesses, such as restaurants, shops, and service providers. In a story book or city, it's unlikely to find specific names of places to stay, as these are not typically the focus of the narrative or the main purpose of a city.
coastal area | Knowledge: The word "bay" refers to a body of water partially enclosed by land, typically with a wider opening than a cove but narrower than a gulf. Therefore, the answer must be an area that is situated along a body of water and has a bay within its geographical boundaries. Lake, shoreline, and beach do not necessarily have bays unless they have a specific body of water that fits the definition of a bay. Manhattan is not typically associated with bays, so coastal area is the correct answer as it refers to a region near a coastline that could potentially have a bay.
salty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject and his girlfriend have differing taste preferences in snacks. The adjective "sweet" is used to describe the girlfriend's preference, which implies that the subject's preference is a contrasting taste. The options "lame," "ocean," and "dry" do not have any clear connection to taste preferences, while "sour" may be a contrasting taste but is not directly related to snack foods. "Salty" is a commonly known taste preference for snack foods such as chips or pretzels, making it the most suitable answer.
universe | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that light from the sun becomes weaker as it spreads out, indicating that it is referring to the vast expanse of space beyond Earth. The option "a locked room" doesn't make sense in this context as light cannot pass through a locked room. "Attic" and "desk" are both indoor spaces and have no connection to outer space. "Ocean" may be a valid option in some cases when discussing the effects of light on water, but in this sentence, the focus is on the universe beyond Earth.
cremated | Knowledge: Cremation is a common method of handling a deceased body, where it is burned and reduced to ashes. While there are other options, such as burial or donation for medical research, the question does not provide any indication that these other options are relevant. The other choices in the question - killed in war, opposed to war, introverted, and murdered - do not provide any information about what happens to a body after death.
south dakota | Knowledge: Aberdeen is a city located in South Dakota, USA. It is not in Washington, Europe, Scotland or Maryland.
ink cartridges | Knowledge: The question suggests that the focus is on keeping pens in use rather than replacing them altogether. The answer, therefore, needs to relate to a part of the pen that can be replaced. Ink cartridges are commonly used in pens and can be easily replaced to keep the pen in use. The other options do not relate to a part that can be replaced, such as taking notes and using color which suggest how to use the pen or caps which are more protective measures.
city | Knowledge: The phrase "a lot of people" suggests that Sonny is looking for a location with high foot traffic. A city would be the best location for this, as it has a dense population and a variety of events that attract large crowds, including concerts. The other options may have some foot traffic, but not to the same extent as a city.
broke | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is no money left after paying bills. The word "broke" is commonly used to describe a situation where someone has no money, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "headaches" and "grief", do not make sense in this context.
office desk | Knowledge: A ballpoint pen is commonly used for writing checks, and the options suggest different locations where someone might be writing a check. Of these options, the most likely location for writing a check is an office desk, as this is where someone might be paying bills or filling out business-related forms. The other options are less likely to be places where someone would write a check, such as a backpack or desk drawer.
hot room | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is at a summer home and is trying to cool down a room. An electric fan is often used to circulate air and create a cooler environment in a hot room. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as the person is not in their office, closet, field, or home in general, but specifically in a hot room.
bathroom | Knowledge: Electric razors are commonly used in bathrooms for shaving. Water is often used to wet the face before shaving or to rinse the razor during and after use. Therefore, it's likely that an electric razor could be exposed to water in a bathroom setting. The other options do not provide a suitable location for the exposure of an electric razor to water.
stay in | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weather outside is cold and snowy, which is not conducive to outdoor activities. Therefore, people are likely to opt to stay indoors to avoid the harsh weather conditions. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to staying indoors during cold and snowy weather.
ugly | Knowledge: The question asks for the opposite of beautiful, which implies something that is unattractive or unpleasant to look at. While the other options may be related to negative connotations of beauty, they do not directly represent the opposite of beautiful. "Plain" and "homely" may be neutral or average in appearance, but they do not necessarily convey the opposite of beauty. "Overcast" refers to a type of weather and is not related to appearance at all, while "a witch" is a specific character and represents a cultural stereotype, which is not a clear opposite to the concept of beauty.
cooked food | Knowledge: The question is asking about the result of cooking, which is typically food that has been prepared for consumption. The other options are either too specific (full feast, having dinner) or not related to the process of cooking (get food, pride).
hells canyon | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a name for the erosion that is opposite or contrasting to the majestic flight of the bald eagle. Hells Canyon is a geologic wonder located on the border of Oregon and Idaho, known for its deep canyons and rugged terrain. The name "Hells Canyon" has a clear contrast to the beautiful eagle soaring through the sky, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
satisfy hunger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James wanted to eat a hamburger for a specific purpose, which is to fulfill the need of his hunger. "Satisfy hunger" is the most logical answer as it directly answers the question of why James wanted to eat a hamburger. "Good to eat," "cook one," "taste," and "protein" are not appropriate answers since they do not address James' immediate need to assuage his hunger.
cool off | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is feeling very angry and may need to calm down before continuing with a certain activity. "Cool off" implies taking a break from the situation and allowing oneself to calm down emotionally. The other options do not fit with the idea of taking a break and calming down, and some of them are even more violent, such as "fight" and "destroy enemy."
reptile farm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the rats are coexisting with turtles, which implies that they are being kept in a controlled environment with these animals. The options "roof," "sewers," and "cellar" do not seem like viable locations for keeping rats with turtles, while a "laboratory" is too broad and could involve a variety of other animals. Therefore, "reptile farm" is the most likely choice as it is a specific location where reptiles and small animals like rats may be kept together.
text book | Knowledge: Mathematical rules are a fundamental part of mathematics, and are usually found in textbooks or other educational materials. These rules are based on mathematical principles and concepts, and are used to solve problems or perform calculations. Family situations, everything, the bible, and lawbooks do not typically contain mathematical rules, and are thus unlikely to be the correct answer.
cleaning house  | Knowledge: The repeated option "clean house" seems to suggest that this is the correct answer, and it also makes sense given that maids are typically hired to perform domestic chores such as cleaning, dusting, and organizing in a private residence. The other options are either redundant or do not pertain specifically to the job description of a maid.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the garden being referred to is open to the public, which is a characteristic commonly associated with parks. Fences are used to enclose private spaces, back yards are typically associated with residential areas, and "pretty" and "ground" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
go to class | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sam was a student at Elmhurst elementary and was late when the bell rang, implying that she needed to get to her class. Therefore, the correct answer is "go to class". The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
sparse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the buffalo were easy to spot because they were big and thick, but also implies that their numbers were reduced significantly by hunting. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to describe a decrease in numbers, which eliminates choices like "thickskin" which have no relation to the sentence. "Thin" and "sparse" are both related to a decrease in numbers and are appropriate options, but "sparse" is the more appropriate choice since it directly implies a scarcity or low numbers.
improved health | Knowledge: Jogging is a form of cardiovascular exercise that can have numerous health benefits, such as strengthening the heart and respiratory system, improving circulation, and reducing the risk of certain diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Sweating, increased heart rate, and being tired are all possible side effects of jogging, but they do not necessarily explain the main benefit of the exercise. Eating cake is not related to the health benefits of jogging.
coming home | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a friend is throwing a party for another friend. The phrase "coming home" suggests that the friend is returning home after being away, which is often a reason for celebration. The other options, such as "keep secret" and "write letter," do not seem to fit the context of a celebratory party.
persistent cough | Knowledge: Smoking is commonly associated with causing damage to the respiratory system, which includes the organs responsible for breathing such as the lungs and trachea. One of the most common symptoms related to smoking and the respiratory system is a persistent cough, which is often caused by irritation and inflammation of the airways from the chemicals in cigarette smoke. The other options, death and heart attack, are potential long-term effects of smoking but are not specific symptoms related to the organ of breathing. Birth defects and bad breath are not typically associated with smoking.
hangar | Knowledge: Airplanes are usually stored indoors in large, enclosed spaces known as hangars. Hangars are designed to protect aircraft from the elements and provide maintenance and storage capabilities. Propellers are a component of an airplane and not a facility. The sky is not a physical structure, and military bases are not indoor facilities designed specifically for airplanes. Gardens are also not designed to hold airplanes.
industrial district | Knowledge: The sentence states that the controversy was about the seafood restaurant getting its fresh Atlantic fish from grimy rivers around a certain location. The phrase "grimy rivers" suggests that the location may be industrial, polluted, or lacking in cleanliness. The options "new york," "city," and "coastal cities" are not specific enough to identify a location with grimy rivers, but "industrial district" is a more fitting choice because it suggests an area with factories or manufacturing that may contribute to pollution in nearby waterways. "Boston" does not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
work for free | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a talent they wanted to contribute to a cause, which indicates a willingness to give their time and effort. Writing a check or thanking God would not involve the person's talent, while teaching someone else or showing emotion are not related to donating a talent. Working for free is a common way for someone to donate their skills and would be a logical choice in this context.
slip and fall | Knowledge: The other options are related to bathing but do not necessarily pose a risk if someone is not paying attention. Dry skin can occur regardless of attention paid during bathing, using soap is a necessary part of bathing, reading a newspaper is a personal choice, and shampoo is meant to be used during bathing. However, slipping and falling can occur if someone is not paying attention and can be a serious injury risk.
horrible | Knowledge: Killing someone is a serious and illegal act that can have severe consequences both for the victim and the perpetrator. The word "usually" suggests that the question is looking for a common outcome of killing, which is typically a negative one. The word "horrible" correctly reflects the gravity of the act and the negative consequences that follow. Remorse is a possible emotion for the perpetrator to feel after committing the crime, but it is not necessarily the outcome of the act itself. Pleasure is not a common or acceptable outcome of killing, and with a knife and funeral are more specific details that do not reflect the general outcome of killing.
notebook | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher expects the students to take a lot of notes during the semester, which implies that they will need something to write on. The recommended item is a notebook, which is a common tool for taking notes. The other options are not as relevant to taking notes in a class setting.
match | Knowledge: A tennis game is typically a part of a larger competition called a match, where two or more players compete against each other according to a set of rules. A match can be part of a larger tournament or championship, where players compete to win a prize or title. "Progress" and "park" do not have any clear connection to the context of a tennis game, and "field with tennis court" is not a commonly used term in tennis.
tuna fish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat was able to recognize the sound of something being opened as a signal to come. Tuna fish is a common cat food that is often opened with a can opener, and it is likely that the cat was trained to associate the sound of the can opener with the reward of getting to eat tuna fish. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
excited | Knowledge: Birthdays are often associated with excitement as it is a special day to celebrate oneself or someone else. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Presents and compliments are typically given on birthdays, but they do not describe the feeling. Eating every day and being expressive do not necessarily have a direct connection to birthdays.
meeting | Knowledge: The question is asking about a method of communication that allows for the exchange of information to large groups at work. A meeting is a common way of achieving this goal, as it allows for a group of people to gather in one place and share information in real time. The other options do not fit within the context of the question. A newspaper is not an interactive medium, a library primarily serves as a repository for information rather than a forum for discussion, television may have limited interactivity, and telegrams are an outdated method of communication.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bailey couldn't find a parking lot in a small area, which limits the options to city, town, or business district. However, the use of "very small" implies that it is more likely to be a town, which is typically smaller than a city or business district. The other options, car and vehicle, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not places where Bailey could leave his vehicle.
meeting | Knowledge: The word "work" in the question suggests that the context is related to a professional setting. In workplaces, people often convene around a table to have meetings, where they discuss important matters, make decisions, or give updates. The other options – kitchen, poker, living room, and internet cafe – do not typically involve people gathering together at work.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the breaker that distributes electricity in a home is being discussed. Typically, breakers are located in the basement or utility room of a home, where the electrical panel is installed. The other options, such as bedroom, concert, opera, and back yard, do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely locations for an electrical panel.
news article  | Knowledge: The question is asking about a lead for a journalist, which implies that it has something to do with the process of writing or reporting news articles. The correct answer is "news article" because a lead is the opening sentence or paragraph of a news article that captures the reader's attention and summarizes the main point of the story. The other options are unrelated to journalism or news reporting.
wall | Knowledge: The question is asking about where one might see a fine picture used as a background for their surroundings, which implies that it would be a larger image rather than something used on a desktop or shelf. The most common place to display a larger picture would be on a wall, making this the most likely answer. An art show may also have larger displays, but the context of the question suggests a more personal use.
altruistic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the behavior being described involves helping others without expecting anything in return. This behavior is commonly referred to as altruism, which is the opposite of selfishness. The other options do not match the context of the sentence - deceptive behavior involves being dishonest, cruel behavior involves intentionally harming others, naive behavior involves being inexperienced or lacking knowledge, and weird behavior is a subjective judgment that doesn't provide any useful information.
green thumb | Knowledge: The phrase "green thumb" is a colloquial expression used to describe someone who has a natural talent for gardening or growing plants. It implies that the person has a special ability to make plants thrive and grow healthy. The other options do not relate to the skill of gardening or plant care.
increased effort | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to improve their performance in a competition. Steroids are illegal and unethical to use for performance enhancement, while anger and vain thoughts wouldn't necessarily help improve performance. An adrenaline rush may offer a short-term boost, but increased effort over time would lead to sustained improvement in performance.
metaphor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that "glass ceiling" was used as a term or idea to describe something that was not strong enough to defeat the opponent. The term "glass ceiling" is a metaphor that refers to an invisible barrier that prevents women or other marginalized groups from achieving professional success. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
fail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is at risk of not passing a course, which would mean they did not meet the necessary requirements to earn a passing grade. In academic settings, failing a course typically means that the student will have to retake the course in order to earn credit for it. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not address the consequences of failing a course.
city | Knowledge: The word "booking office" suggests a place where reservations or tickets are sold. While some banks and malls may indeed have booking offices for specific services, the most likely place to find a general booking office would be in a city, where various types of transportation (e.g. planes, trains, buses) and entertainment (e.g. concerts, museums) are available for purchase. England is too specific and unrelated to the context of the sentence.
workplace | Knowledge: The question is asking about where people typically make friends as an adult, suggesting a specific age range and life stage. The workplace is a common place to make friends as adults spend a significant amount of time there and share common interests and experiences with their coworkers. The other options may also be places where people make friends, but they may not be as common or specific to the adulthood stage.
death | Knowledge: Choking while eating is a serious and potentially fatal incident. The other answer choices are inappropriate in this context and do not reflect the gravity of the situation.
wet surface | Knowledge: The question suggests that the sponge is meant to clean something, and the only option that relates to cleaning is "clean dishes." However, the option appears twice, which suggests that it is a mistake, and the correct answer must be "wet surface," which refers to the sponge's primary function of absorbing and wiping away liquid from various surfaces. "Collect water" and "hold water" are not related to cleaning, and there is already an identical option.
race track | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys watching something go around, which is a characteristic commonly associated with race tracks where cars or horses go around in circles. Additionally, the fact that some people find the event boring and loud fits in with the idea of a race track where the sound of engines or galloping hooves can be quite loud. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
keys | Knowledge: To begin driving a car, the driver needs to have access to the car. The only way to access a car is through its keys, making this the correct answer. Practice and sight may be important for safe and effective driving, but they are not necessary to begin driving. Feet are needed to operate the pedals, but the question is asking about what is needed to even begin. Opening the car door may be necessary to enter the car, but the question pertains to what is needed to begin driving specifically.
then | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James needed the tools immediately, indicating that he had a current need for them. The word "now" reinforces this sense of urgency. The word "remembered" implies that James forgot to pack the tools at an earlier time, possibly before he left for his current location. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "then," as he needed to remember to pack the tools at the time he was packing for his trip, rather than at a later time. The other answer choices do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the best seating location is in the center of a room for optimal viewing. The context of the sentence, "center of the room," is most commonly associated with a theatre, as that is where audiences gather to view performances. The other options, such as a bus depot or rest area, do not typically have seating arrangements where the center of the room is relevant. In a church or classroom, seating arrangements may vary based on the purpose of the room or the preferences of the attendees.
sit and think | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person spends a lot of time thinking, but there is no indication that she is engaging in obsessive or compulsive behavior. The phrase "cogitate over every little thing" emphasizes that she is taking the time to think things through, which would require her to sit and contemplate. "Obsessive compulsive" is a specific condition characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behavior, which is not indicated in the sentence. "Sit quietly" may be a possible option, but it doesn't capture the active thinking implied by "cogitate." "Have brain" is not a valid option, as everyone has a brain, and "schizophrenic" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
mexico | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a North American country has a preference for watching matches on a soccer field. Mexico is a known soccer-loving country, with a significant portion of the population following the sport closely. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Florida | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the terms "peninsula" and "panhandle", which are commonly associated with the state of Florida in the United States. The sentence also implies that this coastal region is popular for vacationing and retirement. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence as well as Florida.
operable | Knowledge: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon, while a theory is a well-substantiated explanation that has been extensively researched and tested. To become a theory, a hypothesis must be tested and shown to be operable or viable, meaning it can be put into practice and produce consistent and accurate results. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe a necessary characteristic of a hypothesis in the process of becoming a theory.
drug store | Knowledge: Birth control pills are typically purchased at a pharmacy or drug store. The other options (woman's purse, Riley's, medicine cabinet, bedroom) are not common places to purchase medication.
subdivision | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the road passes a sign and gate house, which suggests that there is a controlled or restricted area beyond the gatehouse. The word "subdivision" refers to a type of planned residential development that often has a gated entrance and a specific set of rules for residents to follow. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either describe a different type of location (city, countryside) or a fictional place (Narnia).
earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the depletion of forests is having a negative impact on something larger and more significant than any of the individual options. "Earth" is a broad term that could refer to the overall health and sustainability of the planet, which is impacted by the loss of forests due to deforestation, habitat destruction, and other factors. While the other options may be indirectly affected by the loss of forests, such as woodcutting or the presence of national parks, they are not as comprehensive as the term "earth."
toy store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a store has a non-functioning train because of electricity loss. A train in a store is most commonly found in a toy store. Additionally, a toy train would likely be considered non-essential, meaning it would not be a priority for backup generators in cases of electricity loss, unlike a train station or rest area where trains are essential for transportation. The other choices have no clear connection to the sentence's context.
competitiveness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bailey enjoys playing games against other people because he finds it exhilarating, which implies that he is motivated by competition. Competitiveness is often a key motivator for people who enjoy playing games, as it can be satisfying to win and improve one's skills. The other options (arguments, anger, learning, relaxation) do not necessarily have a clear connection to Bailey's motivation for playing games.
sentence | Knowledge: The word "few" suggests a small number of words, which is a characteristic of a sentence. Sentences are composed of a subject and a predicate, and often express a complete thought or idea. Books, newspapers, and mouths can contain many words or large amounts of text, whereas "ring true" is not related to the context of finding a few words.
sister-in-law | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the brother and his wife coming to visit, which indicates that the correct answer should be related to the sister-in-law. Aunty could be a possible answer, but it is a more general term and might not be used specifically for the sister-in-law. Boy and falling down are not related to the context of the sentence, and most families is too general to be the correct answer. Niece is not a likely answer because the sentence does not suggest that the brother and sister-in-law have children.
eat | Knowledge: The question is asking for a logical response to seeing food on a plate. Of the five choices, "eat" is the only appropriate response since it is natural to consume food when it is presented on a plate. "Clean" and "cook" may be necessary actions before or after the actual act of eating, but they do not address the immediate question. "Hunt" and "hungry" imply a different scenario altogether and are not relevant to the given question.
having fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jenny was feeling lonely and wanted to do something enjoyable. Going dancing is a common activity associated with having fun and potentially meeting new people. Fatigue and intercourse do not match the context of the sentence, and the phrase "pick up her next victim" has a negative connotation and is inappropriate.
linen closet | Knowledge: The phrase "cloth to sleep on" implies a material that is used for bedding, which is typically kept in a linen closet. The other choices do not have any correlation to bedding or sleeping. A kitchen is typically associated with cooking and meal preparation, a fabric store sells a variety of materials but not necessarily bedding, a bedroom is where one sleeps but not where to find bedding, and a garage is primarily used for storage of vehicles and tools.
danish | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the dog is lost in Copenhagen, which is the capital city of Denmark. Therefore, it is likely that the dog is of Danish nationality. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not prioritize socializing and was not concerned about his lack of skill in this area. Instead, he had a different goal or motivation. The phrase "didn't care" implies that he was not worried about negative consequences, such as causing trouble or experiencing anxiety. "Having fun" is a likely option, as it suggests enjoyment without the pressure of social expectations or the need to impress others. "Instigating" and "making friends" are unlikely options given the context of the sentence.
tide pool | Knowledge: Anemones are typically found in tide pools, which are shallow depressions in rocks along the shore that fill with seawater during high tide. Tide pools are often home to a variety of marine life, including anemones, which are well-adapted to survive in the constantly changing conditions of the intertidal zone. The other choices, such as a wet pool or field of flowers, do not provide the necessary conditions for anemones to survive.
humans | Knowledge: A ticket office typically refers to a place where tickets are sold or distributed for events or transportation. The context suggests that the question is asking about what kind of beings or entities you could find in a ticket office, and the most common answer would be humans because people would be working or buying tickets there. The other options are not relevant to the context of a ticket office.
living room | Knowledge: The living room is typically the first room that guests would enter when visiting a home. It is also often located near the front entrance of the house. This room is a common area for entertaining guests and relaxing with family, which makes it an important feature of many homes. The other options, such as master suite and basement, are typically not located near the front entrance of the house and are less likely to be the first room you encounter when entering.
agreement | Knowledge: The sentence describes a situation where the speaker and their friends have the same thought or opinion. In this context, the word "agreement" refers to the act of having the same or similar beliefs or views. The other options do not accurately describe the situation described in the sentence, as they either refer to different concepts (communication, magic, happiness) or are too vague (answers).
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tennis court was frequented by an older and more refined group of people, which may indicate that it was located in a more upscale or mature setting such as a park. Health clubs and college campuses may have more diverse age groups, while a high school would likely have younger patrons. Wimbledon is a specific location and not a general descriptor, making it an unlikely answer.
universe | Knowledge: The question asks where the world is known to be a part of, which suggests that the correct answer should be a larger entity that contains the world. The options "a fraud" and "thought" do not make sense in this context, while "countries" is too small of a unit to contain the world. "Galaxy" is also too big, as the world is not a part of an entire galaxy. "Universe" is the most logical option as it is the largest known entity that contains everything in existence.
lamp | Knowledge: Light bulbs are commonly found in lamps, which are designed specifically to hold bulbs and provide a source of light. The other options do not necessarily suggest a specific location where light bulbs are commonly found. A basement, a house, a theater, or a room could all contain light bulbs, but they are not necessarily associated with any particular type of lighting fixture or object.
being satisfied | Knowledge: Being neutral means not having a strong opinion one way or the other. Therefore, if someone is neutral about an idea becoming a reality, they are unlikely to feel a strong sense of fulfillment or elation. "Accomplished" suggests that they were actively involved in making the idea a reality, which may not be the case if they are neutral. "Feeling good" is too general and does not specifically relate to the idea becoming a reality. "Being satisfied" is the best option as it suggests a reasonable level of contentment without a strong emotional response.
Montreal | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a bilingual city, which immediately eliminates options like NYC, big city, wine, and snow. Montreal is a famous bilingual city in Canada and has a strong French cultural influence, which explains why the character thought it was appropriate to visit a French restaurant after an ice hockey game.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the jelly was opened and at risk of spoiling, so it needs to be stored properly. The most common place to store perishable items like this is in the refrigerator, which helps slow the growth of bacteria and keep the food fresher for longer. The other options do not make sense in this context - "away" is too vague, "jar" is just the container the jelly came in, "donuts" and "peanut butter" are unrelated, and none of them suggest a way to prevent spoilage.
go skiing | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the rich kids were looking for an activity to alleviate their boredom, and the suggestion made by one of them was to go up to his parents lodge. The fact that the lodge is mentioned points to the possibility of skiing, as skiing lodges are a common type of accommodation in ski resorts. The other options do not have any direct connection to the context of the sentence.
consciousness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a characteristic that humans possess, but dogs do not. Consciousness is a trait commonly associated with humans and not with dogs, as it refers to the awareness of one's surroundings and the ability to perceive and think. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
butt | Knowledge: The sentence specifically refers to Bob resting his bottom on a chair, which is a colloquial way of saying he sat down and placed his buttocks on the chair. Therefore, the correct answer is "butt." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
park | Knowledge: Parks often have tennis courts available for public use, making them a likely option for John to find a place to play tennis. Towns and Michigan do not provide any specific location for tennis courts. Venus Williams and Wimbledon are not locations where John could realistically find a tennis court to play on without further explanation or context.
roof | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the newspaper did not land on the expected location of the porch, which implies that it was thrown or delivered in a way that caused it to land elsewhere. The option "roof" is the most likely explanation for where the newspaper landed, as it is a common place for items to accidentally end up if they are thrown or dropped. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
falling down | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person climbing is experiencing fear as they climb higher, which suggests that they are worried about something going wrong. Out of the options, "falling down" is the most likely thing to go wrong while climbing. "Exhaustion" does not fit the context of fear, while "accomplishment" and "exhilaration" are positive feelings that do not fit with the fear suggested by the sentence. "Eagles" may be a threat in some circumstances, but it is less likely to be the cause of fear while climbing.
feel full | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has stopped eating lunch, which could be because they have satisfied their hunger and feel full. Feeling full after a meal is a natural response that signals the body has received enough nutrients and energy to function properly. While sleepiness may occur after a large meal, it is not necessarily the reason why the person has stopped eating lunch. The other options, such as there being no more food or feeling sleepy, do not necessarily explain why the person has stopped eating.
All of the above | Knowledge: Winning a baseball game is often associated with positive emotions such as joy, celebration, pride, being in good spirits, and overall happiness. These emotions stem from the sense of accomplishment and success achieved by the team or individual who won the game. Therefore, any of these choices could be a potential outcome after winning a baseball game.
mexico | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that Sally is looking for information about the origin of her cabinets, so the correct answer would be a location where the cabinets could have been made. The options "pantry," "planes," and "kitchen" are not places where cabinets would typically be made. "Texas" could be a potential answer, but the author's mention of checking both the undersink and oversink cabinets suggests that the cabinets were not made domestically. "Mexico" is the most likely answer since it is a country where many consumer goods, including cabinets, are manufactured.
manipulate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the real estate agent intentionally sold the house for less than its actual value, which implies some kind of deception or manipulation. The other options do not convey the same meaning and are not consistent with the context of the sentence. "Incompetent" suggests a lack of skill or knowledge, which would make it unlikely for the agent to successfully sell the house at any price. "Fib" and "exaggerate" suggest less serious forms of deception that would not result in selling the house for less than its value. "Charming" does not have any clear connection to selling a house for less than it is worth.
petting zoo | Knowledge: A petting zoo is a place where visitors are encouraged to interact with animals, and typically features domesticated animals like goats, sheep, and sometimes even rabbits or guinea pigs. Snakes are not typically found in petting zoos, as they are not considered suitable animals for hands-on interactions with people. The other options describe environments where snakes can potentially be found, depending on the species - hollow logs and tropical forests, in particular, are habitats that many snake species prefer.
hydration | Knowledge: Drinking water is important for maintaining proper hydration in the body, which is necessary for many bodily functions such as regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and lubricating joints. Headaches can be a symptom of dehydration, but drinking water can relieve them. Swallowing is the action of moving food or liquid from the mouth to the stomach, and is not a purpose of drinking water. Hunger is a sensation that occurs when the body needs nutrients, not necessarily water. Vomiting is the involuntary expulsion of the contents of the stomach, and is not related to drinking water.
living room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog enjoyed taking naps on the couch, which is a piece of furniture commonly found in living rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
relax | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sam needed to rest but didn't have time to sleep, so instead he just went to the couch. This indicates that he intended to take a break but not necessarily to fall asleep. Out of the options provided, "relax" is the most appropriate choice because it suggests a state of rest without necessarily implying sleep. "Pig out" and "slow pace" are not appropriate because they suggest physical activity rather than rest, and "go to bed" implies that Sam plans to fall asleep. "Lay down" could be a valid option, but "relax" is a more general and inclusive term that encompasses the possibility of lying down as well as other restful activities.
gulf states | Knowledge: The sentence includes the word "hurricane" which is typically associated with coastal regions. Alabama is a state situated on the Gulf of Mexico, making it one of the Gulf States - a term commonly used to refer to the states which border the Gulf of Mexico (Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas). The other choices are not as relevant to the context of the sentence.
bitter | Knowledge: The question asks for a food that is not sweet, implying that the other answer choices may be sweet in nature. Bitter is a taste that is often contrasted with sweet, and is used to describe foods that have a sharp, acrid, or unpleasant taste. The other answer choices do not necessarily relate to taste, or do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
furniture store | Knowledge: An armoire is a large piece of furniture, typically used for clothing storage, and is commonly sold at furniture stores. The other options, such as living room, house, or bedroom, are locations where one might have an armoire, but not necessarily purchase one. A butcher shop also has no connection to the context of the question.
road or freeway | Knowledge: The sentence implies that commuters are in a hurry and need to move quickly, which suggests they are likely on a road or freeway. Both of these options are commonly associated with rush hour traffic and fast-moving vehicles, whereas the other choices (city, race track, race) do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
nursery rhyme | Knowledge: The reference to a cow jumping over the moon is a well-known line from the nursery rhyme "Hey Diddle Diddle." The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not relate to the cultural reference being made.
stink | Knowledge: Boots are often worn for prolonged periods of time, particularly for activities like hiking, working on a farm or construction site, or military training. During this time, feet can sweat and develop odor due to the lack of ventilation and moisture buildup in the boots. Therefore, it is likely that the feet will "stink" after being in boots all day. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
library or book store | Knowledge: A bookshelf is a piece of furniture specifically designed to hold books, so the correct answer needs to be a place where books are typically sold or stored. The bedroom and furniture store options are possible but less common places for bookshelves to be found. The ocean option is clearly irrelevant to the question. Therefore, the most likely answers are the library or the book store, as these are places where books are frequently found and displayed on bookshelves.
Texas | Knowledge: The question asks for a delta state known for good BBQ. While "backyard" and "ribs" are associated with BBQ, they do not refer to a specific state. "Louisiana" is known for its Cajun cuisine, but not necessarily for BBQ. "Restaurant" is too broad a category. "Texas," on the other hand, is famous for its BBQ, with various styles of BBQ found throughout the state.
amusement park | Knowledge: UFO catcher machines are commonly found in game arcades and amusement parks, where customers can try to grab prizes with a mechanical claw. The other options (toy store, farm, children's room, hall) do not typically have UFO catcher machines.
brassiere | Knowledge: The context suggests that the person is talking about an article of clothing or accessory that has a strap. A brassiere is a type of undergarment that typically has straps that need to be tightened to provide support. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the harmonica is a small instrument that can fit easily into a pocket. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
building | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James's place was small and he constructed a playroom for his children. Since the playroom is described as unattached, it implies that it is separate from the main living area, which suggests that it was probably built in a separate structure, most likely a building. The other options such as preschool, indoor games, nursery school, and big house do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not related to James constructing a playroom for his children in a separate structure.
peace | Knowledge: Forgiveness is often associated with finding peace and releasing feelings of anger and vengeance. A forgiving individual may experience a sense of inner calm and contentment rather than a desire for vengeance or the need to seek respect or good karma. While having a good heart and cultivating positive energy (good karma) may be associated with forgiveness, they are not necessarily the direct result of forgiving behavior. Similarly, forgiveness may lead to a sense of new freedom, but this is not the direct outcome that is suggested by the context of the sentence.
fill with tears | Knowledge: When someone gets punched in the nose, it can cause pain and irritation which can trigger a response from the lacrimal gland, which produces tears. Tears help to keep the eyes moist and provide lubrication, which can be helpful if the nose gets injured. The other options do not make sense in the context of being punched in the nose.
nightclub | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was looking for a place to drink after work, but couldn't find a bar. Based on the context of the sentence, a nightclub would be a logical alternative option, as they often serve alcohol and stay open late at night. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ruin | Knowledge: The other options suggest destruction or decomposition, which is the opposite of what archaeologists would want to preserve. "Ruin" suggests the preservation or protection of the remains of the lost city, which is the goal of archaeologists in many cases. "Use" is not relevant in this context, and "rot," "waste," and "decay" suggest negative outcomes that would not be desirable for preservation efforts.
respected | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people willingly followed rules or guidelines without being told to, implying that they had a sense of respect for authority or societal norms. The other options all suggest a deliberate act of defiance or rebellion, which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "respected."
briefcase  | Knowledge: The question suggests that a business man would keep a plane ticket with other documents, indicating that it is an important document. A briefcase is a common item used by businessmen to store important documents and items, so it is the most logical choice. The other options (boarding plane, airport, pocket, shirt sleeve) are unlikely places to store a plane ticket for safekeeping.
profit | Knowledge: When discussing financial terms related to a business, debt is commonly used to refer to money owed or borrowed. The opposite of debt in this context would be a positive financial situation where the business has more money coming in than going out. This is commonly referred to as profit, which is the amount of revenue earned after deducting expenses. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to buy chocolate to use in baking a cake. Generally, one would find baking ingredients such as chocolate at a supermarket. The other options, such as a chicken stall or a restaurant, are unlikely to sell chocolate for baking purposes. A box and movie theater also do not typically sell food products.
panic | Knowledge: The question describes a situation where someone's heart is racing during a public outing. This physical response is often associated with panic or anxiety, as the body's fight or flight response is triggered. Pain, embarrassment, sorrow, or tiredness do not typically cause this kind of physiological response.
television | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is settling in to watch a program on a device. The options "concert" and "opera" are unlikely as they are live performances and not typically watched at home. "Computer" is not likely as it is not typically associated with watching television shows or programs. "Lamp" is not a device at all. This leaves "television" as the most logical answer.
play games | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that by controlling the destiny of imaginary kingdoms, one can conquer boredom. This implies that the activity being described is a game or a form of imaginative play. While reading and watching films can be entertaining, they do not involve actively controlling an imaginary world, so they are less likely to fulfill the criteria of "controlling the destiny." Playing chess and cards are specific activities that may or may not involve imaginary kingdoms, so they are less likely to be the correct answer compared to the more general choice of "play games."
nonprofit | Knowledge: The question asks for a type of business that would help people, which suggests that the business should have a positive impact on society or the community. Nonprofit organizations are typically structured to achieve charitable or social goals without generating profit for shareholders, which aligns with the idea of helping people. The other options either have a different purpose or may be unethical, such as pyramid schemes.
ditch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that is drawing ground water away from both the speaker's yard and their neighbor's yard. The most likely option is a ditch, which is a channel or trench dug to collect or convey water. The other options - house next door, next house, suburbs, trees - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to draw ground water away from the yards.
draw pictures | Knowledge: Cave paintings are a well-known example of early human artistic expression, and they were often created on cave walls. The use of the word "draw" suggests that the early humans were creating images on the cave walls, rather than doing any of the other activities listed. The idea of early humans laying eggs or eating fruit is unlikely, while making tools and competing with each other do not fit within the context of the sentence.
plants | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that grows well in the sun, and the most logical option that fits this context is plants. Plants require sunlight for photosynthesis to occur, which is the process by which they produce food and energy. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence in any meaningful way.
cd player | Knowledge: The question is asking for a device that can play a disk in a portable manner, which suggests that the device should be small and easily transportable. A cd player is a common portable device that allows you to play a disk, and is suitable for use in a variety of locations. The other options are not relevant to the task of playing a disk on a portable device. For example, a computer hard drive needs to be connected to a computer in order to play a disk, and is not typically portable. Music and data storage are also not devices that can play disks directly. A computer store is a place to buy computer-related hardware and software, but is not a device itself.
being caught | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the prisoner was known for attempting to escape frequently and that he was not successful in escaping every time. The phrase "just as often" implies that the opposite of escaping happened with the same frequency, which would be being caught. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
gaining weight | Knowledge: Eating too much regularly can lead to an excess of calories, which can lead to weight gain over time. The body stores excess calories as fat, which can result in an increase in body weight. Getting full and satisfaction may occur after eating a large amount of food, but these choices do not necessarily indicate any negative consequences. Gas may be a side effect of certain foods, but it is not typically associated with overeating.
parliament | Knowledge: Parliament is the location where politicians in London would be found. It is the legislative body of the UK government and is located in London. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
beauty | Knowledge: Grooming typically refers to taking care of one's appearance, such as by washing, styling or trimming hair, applying makeup or skincare, etc. Therefore, it makes sense that someone who is constantly grooming is trying to preserve or enhance their beauty. The other options, such as injury or late, do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
write out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is expected to perform a task with the section in class, and the most likely task would be to write it out. The other options do not make sense in the context of memorizing a section for a class. Repeating or acting it out might be useful for memorization but not necessarily for a class task. Awake and concentrate are not tasks that can be performed with a section of text.
neck | Knowledge: The carotid artery is a major blood vessel located in the neck that provides the brain with oxygen-rich blood. It can be damaged by trauma or due to conditions such as atherosclerosis, which can lead to stroke or other serious health complications. The other options do not have any connection to the location of the carotid artery in the body.
countryside | Knowledge: The description of the ranch house overlooking unobscured mountains and valleys implies that it was located in a rural area with a natural landscape. The word "countryside" best fits this description, as it refers to areas outside of cities and urban areas that are typically characterized by open fields, farmland, and natural scenery. The other options, such as subdivision or metropolis, imply a more populated or built-up environment, which does not match the description of the location given in the sentence. Montana and desert may seem like possible choices, but they are not the best answer because they are specific locations that may not fit the context of the sentence, whereas countryside is a more general term that can describe a wide range of rural locations.
stairwell | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that there is no need for the fire extinguisher to be in the kitchen, as no cooking is allowed in the house. The garage and outside may not be optimal locations for the extinguisher as they may not be easily accessible in case of a fire. The stairwell, on the other hand, is a central location that provides easy access from anywhere in the house and can minimize the spread of a fire to other parts of the house. Therefore, the stairwell is the most logical choice for placing a fire extinguisher in this scenario.
cloudy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lack of sunshine is due to some external condition rather than the sun itself. The word "cloudy" suggests that the weather was overcast and therefore blocked the sun's rays. The other options are not related to weather conditions and do not provide any logical explanation for the absence of sunshine.
shower | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is bathing and brushing their hair at the same time, which indicates that they are likely in the shower. It makes sense to store a round brush in a place where it is easily accessible when needed, and the shower would be the most convenient place to do so. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to what activities or experiences one can have while sleeping. Dreams and nightmares are both common experiences during sleep, while relaxation is a state of being that one may encounter while falling asleep or during deep sleep. Bad dreams are a type of nightmare, and so can happen while sleeping. "Having fun" typically requires a level of conscious effort and awareness which is not present during sleep, making it the correct answer.
make wine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person Sally knows works at a distillery and takes public transportation to get there. Distilleries are known for producing alcohol, not cake, catching a cold, or wearing jeans. The only choice that is related to alcohol production is "make wine," which is a common job in a distillery. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
living room | Knowledge: The decision to buy a play mat and put it in front of the TV suggests that the family intended to use it as a form of entertainment or recreation. The living room is a common area in the house for relaxation and watching TV, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not make sense in this context - a play mat would not be practical in a pool or a bathroom and it would be unlikely for a school to allow a play mat in their classrooms. A doorway also does not make sense as it is a thoroughfare rather than a designated area for play.
house | Knowledge: Birthday parties are typically held in homes, making it the most likely option for where a person might play an acoustic guitar at such an event. Studios and music shops are more professional settings, while playing at a funeral place would be inappropriate for a joyous occasion like a birthday party. Closets are unlikely to be a suitable location for playing music or hosting a party.
loft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was adding flooring to a space above his garage, which is a common area to convert into a loft. A loft is a space that is open to the rest of the house and is typically used as a living area or office. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a bedroom, kitchen, or house would typically already be built and not have flooring added to them. Home Depot is a store and not a space that can be created.
chicken coop | Knowledge: The question is asking for an alternative to buying eggs from the supermarket. The options "farm" and "henhouse" are too broad and do not provide a clear solution to the problem of obtaining eggs. "Plate" is clearly not a viable option since it is not an object or method for obtaining eggs. "Bird's nest" is also not a practical solution since it is unlikely that wild birds would lay eggs in a location accessible to humans. "Chicken coop," on the other hand, is a place where domesticated hens can lay eggs that are fresh, healthy, and easily accessible to their owners.
presence | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the child was lacking something from their parents, which is likely emotional support or companionship. The word "lonely" confirms this assumption. Therefore, the correct answer should be related to the child's desire to have their parents around or to be with them. "Presence" best fits this context. The other options do not make sense in this sentence.
atlas | Knowledge: An atlas is a collection of maps, so it is the most likely place to find a lot of maps. The other options do not have any clear association with maps. An amusement park and backpack would not be places to find maps, while drawing and classroom could potentially have maps, but not necessarily in large quantities.
cheap | Knowledge: The context suggests that Sean's clothes were of low quality, which may be indicated by his clothes being described as "not high quality" and "very" something negative. "Cheap" is the best fit for this as it implies low cost and low quality. The other options do not necessarily suggest that Sean's clothes were inexpensive or low quality.
need each other | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people who are having difficulties require support from others. "Need each other" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of dependence and mutual assistance, which is commonly associated with people facing tough situations. The other options do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
spending money | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the noisy, flashing "one-armed bandits" refer to slot machines, which are often found in casinos. The phrase "if she was going to play" indicates that the person is considering gambling, and the phrase "she was going to be" suggests that there will be a certain outcome or behavior associated with that decision. The option "spending money" is the most likely choice, as gambling often involves risking money in the hopes of winning more. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
trees | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy is collecting leaves from nature, rather than from man-made objects like compost piles or floral arrangements. Trees are a natural source of leaves, and forests are a common location for trees, making the option "forest" also a plausible answer. The options "bathroom" and "compost pile" do not have any clear connection to finding leaves for a collection.
western Texas | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer is a geographical region in the southern United States and that this region is known for having venomous snakes. The option "western Texas" is a geographic location in the southern United States that is known to have a variety of venomous snakes, including rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
in between | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy did not take a side between two friends or groups of people. The phrase "in between" means the space or position that separates two things or people, which is the most fitting description of Billy's stance. The other options do not accurately describe a neutral position where someone would not have to pick a side.
office supply store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs a stapler and index card, which are commonly found in an office setting. The other options, oral report, book store, library, and card catalogue, do not typically sell office supplies. Office supply stores typically carry a wide range of office-related products, including staplers and index cards. Therefore, an office supply store would be the best option to purchase these items.
internet cafe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people who die from dehydration were playing games excessively, indicating that they were likely playing video games or computer games. Of the choices given, only the internet cafe is a place where someone might spend an extended amount of time playing games on a computer or video game console. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer is related to the outcome of the Civil War. Therefore, the answer should be a location that was further towards the winning side of the war. States such as Michigan and Minnesota were not directly involved in the Civil War and do not have a clear connection to the sentence. A hospital may be located in any state or city, so it does not provide any useful information. The correct answer is likely to be a city located in a region that was further towards the side that won the war.
human | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "robots" and implies that sometimes people may act like emotionless machines. However, it goes on to suggest that this is not the case and that we are all actually something else. The correct answer, therefore, needs to be a word that is the opposite of robotic or mechanical. Of the options given, "human" is the only one that fits this description, as it refers to our species and our capacity for emotions and free will. The other options are either too negative or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
street | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that James walked barefoot on something that was made hot by sunshine. This suggests that he was walking on a surface that absorbs heat from the sun, such as asphalt or concrete, which are commonly found on streets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
building | Knowledge: High rises are typically tall buildings with many floors, so the correct answer is likely to be related to construction. The sentence mentions windows, which are a common feature on buildings to allow for light and ventilation. The options "warehouse," "friend's house," and "wall" are unlikely to be made primarily of windows, and "space shuttle" is not a type of building at all.
field of flowers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that gardeners in different states value bees as pollinators, which implies that bees are commonly found in gardens where they are needed to pollinate plants. Since options like 'apiary' or 'Michigan' refer to specific locations rather than a general setting or environment, they are unlikely to be the correct answer. Similarly, 'trees' does not fully capture the idea of bees as pollinators since not all trees require bees for pollination. Therefore, the most relevant and specific option among the choices is 'field of flowers.'
car show | Knowledge: A car show is an event where car enthusiasts gather to display and view beautiful cars. It is a common place to find a variety of beautifully designed and maintained cars, some of which may be rare or expensive. The other options may contain cars, but they do not necessarily have a focus on displaying or showcasing them in a way that would suggest a concentration of beautiful cars.
living room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a piece of furniture that is suitable for guests to sleep on in their living room, indicating that the correct answer is likely to be a type of furniture. Out of the options given, only the living room fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
elderly person | Knowledge: The question is asking about a type of person who is more likely to get an illness. Studies show that elderly individuals are more susceptible to illnesses due to their weakened immune systems, higher risk of chronic conditions, and other factors associated with aging. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
children | Knowledge: Contraceptive devices are used to prevent pregnancy, which is the creation of a child. The other options, such as person, drug store, and pharmacy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
know everything | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question is studying constantly, which suggests that they are trying to gain as much knowledge as possible. The phrase "know everything" is the most appropriate choice in this context, as it aligns with the idea of someone who is constantly studying. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "own house" and "make more money" are unrelated to studying, "spare time" suggests that the person is not making efficient use of their time, and "show off" implies that the person is studying with the intention of impressing others rather than gaining knowledge.
gas | Knowledge: A car needs a fuel source to generate the energy necessary to move, and gas is the most common fuel source for cars. Accidents and traffic accidents do not cause a car to move, they are events that may occur while a car is moving. A ticket is a consequence of breaking traffic laws, but it does not cause a car to move. Driving is the action taken to operate a car, but it is not the cause of movement.
hydroelectric dam  | Knowledge: Water turning turbines is a characteristic of hydroelectric power generation, which is typically done in large structures called hydroelectric dams. Puddles, sump pumps, underground streams, and sinks do not have the infrastructure or characteristics necessary for hydroelectric power generation.
work together | Knowledge: The phrase "common goal" implies that both people have a shared objective they want to achieve. The most effective way to achieve this goal would be to collaborate and work together towards a solution. Agreeing with each other may help to start the process, but it does not necessarily guarantee that the goal will be achieved. Making love and having fun are not relevant to the context of the question. Shaking hands is a social gesture that signifies a greeting or agreement, but it does not provide any information on how to accomplish a shared goal.
computer | Knowledge: Working from home typically entails the use of a computer to access work-related resources and complete tasks. Installing a program would also require the use of a computer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
theater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is pretending to be an action figure but is not trying to sell action figures. This implies that the person is likely performing or acting, rather than simply displaying or selling toys. The options of bathtub, museum, and store do not fit this context. While a toy store may have action figures for sale, it does not necessarily imply that someone would be pretending to be an action figure there. The theater is the most likely setting for someone to be pretending to be an action figure for a performance or play.
jar | Knowledge: Storing candy in an airtight container is a common way to keep it from going stale. A jar is a type of container that can be sealed with a lid to keep air out, making it a logical choice for storing candy. The other options - trunk of car, movies, Disneyland, and supermarket - do not make sense in the context of storing candy to keep it from going stale.
piggy bank | Knowledge: A piggy bank is a common place for kids to put their coins in their room, as it is a designated container for storing money. A wishing well is not typically found in a child's room and is more commonly associated with making wishes. A parking meter is not a logical location for a child's coin in their room. Putting money under a pillow is a traditional practice for the tooth fairy to leave money in exchange for a lost tooth, but it is not a common long-term storage solution for coins. A change purse is also a possible option, but it may not be as commonly used or associated with children as a piggy bank.
math | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that science is a challenging subject, which implies that some subjects may be considered easier or purer in comparison. Math is a subject that is often considered to have a logical and structured approach to problem-solving, which may be seen as purer or more straightforward than science. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, nor are they commonly considered purer subjects than science.
neighborhood | Knowledge: The phrase "in your neck of the woods" means nearby or in your immediate area. The other choices may also have a grocery store, but they do not necessarily indicate proximity to the speaker. However, the word "neighborhood" suggests a local area, which is likely to have a nearby grocery store. Therefore, the correct answer is neighborhood.
unpredictable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person playing the fiddle is doing so in a haphazard or random manner, meaning that there is no predictable pattern to their playing. As a result, it is unlikely that they will play a specific song next, and instead their playing may be influenced by various factors such as their mood or surroundings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
having fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that some people find socializing to be enjoyable. The phrase "way of" indicates that socializing is a means or method for achieving something. The options "anxiety," "become more popular," and "become popular" do not fit with the idea of socializing as a positive thing. "Meeting new people" could be a possible answer, but the word "enjoy" suggests that the purpose of socializing is to have a good time, which is best reflected in the option "having fun."
convenient spot | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man requested a tissue holder to be installed in a specific location at the dealership that would be easily accessible or convenient for customers to use. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a "convenient spot." The other options do not make sense in the context of a dealership as they refer to places like a bathroom or bedroom, office, airplane, or car, which are not directly related to the dealership environment.
woodlands | Knowledge: Beavers are known for building dams and lodges in wooded areas near bodies of water. This is because they need access to both water and trees in order to survive. Ontario and Canada are both locations where beavers can be found, but they do not answer the question of what kind of habitat the beaver lives in. Marshlands are not typically a preferred habitat for beavers because they do not provide the necessary building materials. A zoo is not a natural habitat for any animal.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that waiting until the last minute to buy Christmas presents will result in some form of negative experience. The option "debt" may be a consequence of waiting until the last minute to shop, but it is not directly related to the experience of waiting. "Pleasure" and "good cheer" are positive experiences that are unlikely to result from waiting until the last minute to buy Christmas presents. "Lack of money" may also be a consequence of waiting until the last minute, but it does not specifically relate to the experience of waiting. Therefore, "stress" is the most likely correct answer as it is a common negative experience associated with procrastination and last-minute shopping.
audio | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the show was done live, implying that there was a risk associated with the live performance. The word "producers" suggests that this risk was related to the production aspect of the show. The word "worried" indicates that the producers were concerned about something that could have gone wrong during the live broadcast. Since the five options given are related to the production and broadcast of a show, the correct answer is most likely the one that fits best in the context of the sentence. In this case, "audio" seems like the most reasonable choice since sound quality is a common challenge in producing live events. The other options either do not fit the context of the sentence or are not specific enough.
steppe | Knowledge: Gazelles are typically found in grasslands and steppe environments, which provide them with the space to run and jump freely. Wildife refuges and encyclopedias are not types of terrain, while an open field could work but does not specifically indicate the type of grassland environment that gazelles prefer.
form fitting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah prefers loose clothing and doesn't like showing off her curves. Form fitting clothes are the opposite of loose clothes and are designed to hug the curves of the body, which Sarah may find uncomfortable or revealing. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
spend money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker is trying to purchase food, and the cashier has given a requirement for making the purchase. In this case, the requirement is to spend money, as food is typically not free. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence - driving a car or feeling hunger may be related to obtaining food, but they are not requirements for making a purchase. Needing to eat is also not a requirement for buying food, as someone could be buying food for someone else.
fairy tale | Knowledge: The name Cinderella is most commonly associated with the fairy tale character of the same name. The other options listed do not have any clear association with the name Cinderella, making them unlikely choices for the correct answer.
unobservant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has been warned about the sharpness of an object, but continues to cut themselves. This behavior could be described as someone who is not paying attention or observing the warning, which aligns with the definition of unobservant. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior in the sentence.
eat food | Knowledge: The question is asking about the action that is typically taken during the time frame of having lunch. Lunch is a mealtime where individuals usually consume food, and therefore, the correct answer is "eat food". The other options may be things that individuals also do during lunchtime, but they are not the primary action that is being asked for in the question.
cast shadow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is standing in front of his computer and the monitor is lighting up the room. If James is standing in front of the monitor, his body would likely cast a shadow on the wall or other objects behind him. None of the other choices are likely outcomes in this scenario.
go to jail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a court case with a tough judging may have serious consequences, such as going to jail. The other options do not necessarily follow from the context of the sentence. "Being judged" is a general outcome of a court case but does not necessarily imply a tough judgment or serious consequences, while "responsibility" and "feeling guilty" are more emotional or personal outcomes rather than legal ones. "Killing" is not related to the context at all.
opera | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the setting is a theater or performance venue, as people are rushing down the aisles in response to a fire alarm. The word "opera" is the only choice that is related to a specific type of performance, while the other options ("mind," "war," "quandary," "breath") do not have an obvious link to the context of the sentence.
home | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location where the person eats most of their food, which suggests that they are referring to a place where they regularly consume food. The option "in a bowl" only refers to a type of dishware and is not a location. "Freezer" and "store" are places where food is stored or purchased, respectively. "Kitchen" is a possible location where one might eat, but it is not as specific as "home." Therefore, "home" is the most suitable answer.
consider the options | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the archaeologist encountered artifacts that were confusing or did not fit with his current understanding. In this situation, it would be logical for him to take a step back and consider his options, such as conducting further research or seeking out expert opinions. The options "angry," "painful memories," and "learning" do not fit with the context of the sentence and are irrelevant. "Thinking" could be a plausible answer, but "consider the options" is a more precise and actionable choice that directly addresses the archaeologist's dilemma.
fitness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman is pushing herself to jog faster and faster, which suggests that she is trying to improve her physical fitness. Fitness is often associated with activities like jogging and running that require endurance and stamina. The other options are not necessarily related to improving physical fitness, but rather may be consequences or side effects of exercising, such as sweating or fatigue.
slot machine | Knowledge: The sentence references a "card slot for casino member points," which indicates that the device is found in a casino and is likely related to gambling. Of the options given, only a slot machine fits this description. The other options are either unrelated to casinos or do not have a card slot for member points.
understanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the employees were not performing well and needed some sort of assistance, possibly in the form of meetings. The choice "understanding" makes sense as the meetings may have been aimed at helping the employees gain a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities or how to improve their work. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
smile | Knowledge: The question is asking about what customers could do after being served by the speaker. While all of the choices are possible actions, the most appropriate answer is "smile" as it is a common social response after receiving service or help from someone. The other options are less likely or inappropriate for this context, such as "scream" or "make money."
trunk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the container needs to be large, rectangular, and able to keep moths away. A trunk fits this description, as it is typically a large, rectangular container with a tight-fitting lid that keeps out bugs and dust. Basements are not containers, but rather a space in which items can be stored. Trash and trash box are not good choices for storing clothes, as they are not designed to protect anything from the environment.
search the web | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person watching TV has a desire to learn more about what is being shown on the TV. Searching the web is the most appropriate choice here, as it allows the person to easily access additional information and resources about what they are watching. The other choices are either not relevant to the situation (such as going somewhere), or do not provide a practical way to explore the topic further (such as simply watching a favorite show or reading a book). Analyzing is also a possibility, but it is less practical for casual viewing and may not be suitable in this context.
community | Knowledge: The question specifies that the person wants to buy a condominium near the Pacific ocean. Washington and California are both states located along the Pacific coast, so the answer should be one of those two. Since the question doesn't provide any further information about specific cities, "community" would be the best answer as it refers to a general area or residential district rather than a specific state or complex. Florida and Michigan are not located on the Pacific coast, so they can be eliminated as possible answers. Similarly, "complex" is too specific and doesn't provide any information about the location of the condominium.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was not comfortable sleeping on Mary's hide sofa bed. Since the options provided are all places to find a place to sleep, we can eliminate apartment, guest room, and house as choices because they are all places that are likely to have similar sleeping arrangements to Mary's. Couch is a possibility, but it's not clear whether there is a couch available for James to sleep on. So the most logical choice based on the information given is hotel, as it is a place specifically designed for people to stay and sleep comfortably.
cumbersome | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker did not like the older blanket, indicating that it was likely heavy, difficult to manage or move, and possibly even burdensome. The word "cumbersome" is commonly used to describe objects that are difficult or unwieldy to handle, making it an appropriate choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jealousy | Knowledge: The sentence is suggesting that the person is losing and looking at their opponent's score. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the person may feel jealous of their opponent's success. Jealousy is a common emotion that people experience when they feel threatened by someone else's success. The other options, such as anger, hatred, and seeing work, do not fit well with the context of the sentence.
make love | Knowledge: This question is asking about the process of procreation, which typically involves sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. "Make love" is a euphemism for sexual activity and is commonly associated with the act of conceiving children. The other options are not relevant to the process of having biological children.
exercise | Knowledge: The question implies that friends are giving advice to a member of the priesthood in a new church about improving their physical health. The word "shape" suggests that the person may need to exercise and improve their fitness level. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
practice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that to become great at fiddling, one needs to do something repeatedly to improve their skills. This is commonly associated with practice, which is an essential component of learning and mastery in any skill-based activity. The other options do not have any explicit connection to the context of the sentence.
retail store | Knowledge: A shopping bag is typically used to carry items purchased at a retail store, which is where you would typically find clothes for sale. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not typically associated with selling clothing. A grocery store, for example, is where you would buy food items, while a pharmacy is where you would buy medications and health-related products.
concert | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group was performing live when the guitarist smashed his guitar, which is a behavior commonly associated with rock concerts. Rock music is often perceived as loud and energetic, which may explain the rowdy behavior of the group. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ceremony | Knowledge: Altars are commonly associated with religious or ceremonial settings, where activities such as praying, performing rituals, or conducting services may take place. The word "ceremony" in the options best fits the context of the sentence, as it represents a formal event or occasion that may involve the use of an altar. The other options, such as temple, church services, or sanctuary, are also associated with religious settings, but do not specifically indicate a need for an altar.
prison | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a drug dealer has been convicted of a felony, which typically leads to a sentence of incarceration. Prison is the most likely option, as it is where individuals convicted of serious crimes are sent to serve their sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are not likely locations for someone who has been convicted of a felony.
hard | Knowledge: The sentence establishes that the man was gentle but also worked out, suggesting that his muscles may have been developed as a result. The word "hard" is commonly used to describe well-developed or toned muscles, and it aligns with the context of the sentence. The other choices lack a clear connection to the context of the sentence or do not accurately describe the muscular condition of the man.
art show | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people specifically go to a location to view famous pictures, and "art show" is the only option that fits this context. A "window" or "trunk" is not a place where pictures would be displayed for viewing, and "newspaper" or "books" may contain pictures but do not refer to a specific location where famous pictures can be seen.
meeting  | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that when gentlemen need to talk, they likely have a specific purpose or agenda to discuss, which would typically occur in a meeting. This could be a business meeting or a social gathering. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, with the men's room being a place for restroom facilities, meditation centers being reserved for quiet reflection rather than discussions, church being a place of worship rather than discussion, and Europe being a continent rather than a specific location or activity.
combustion engines | Knowledge: Combustion engines require oil to operate effectively. This is because oil lubricates the moving parts of the engine and helps to prevent friction and wear. Ground, human body, repair shop, and service station do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sense of rhythm | Knowledge: Jumping rope involves timing and coordination, which are key elements of rhythm. The repetitiveness of the movement can also help develop a sense of rhythm over time. The other options do not relate to the physical or mental sensations associated with jumping rope.
financial | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that politicians often talk about small time farmers, but in reality, most farms are related to finance or money. This may suggest that politicians are not fully aware of the actuality of farming or are using farming as a political tool to gain votes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dog house | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can provide a comfortable sleeping space for a puppy outside, which suggests an item designed specifically for a dog's needs. A dog house or kennel is a common option for providing shelter and a designated sleeping area for a dog. A table or tree would not be suitable for a dog's sleeping needs, and a "home" is too general of an answer to provide a clear solution.
dictionary | Knowledge: The answer cannot be dictionary because it is not a location where John could have looked for beavers. The options America, Australia, countryside, and woodlands are all plausible locations where beavers could be found, but without further context it is impossible to determine which one is the correct answer.
soccer game | Knowledge: The sentence describes a scenario where someone is drinking beer and watching men play a sport with a black and white ball using their feet. This is a common combination associated with soccer games, as they are often watched in social settings with drinks and snacks. The other options, such as shelf, refrigerator, can, and yacht, are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
san francisco | Knowledge: The question asks specifically for a location where a vegetarian restaurant can be found. While it is possible for vegetarian restaurants to be found in any of the listed locations, the sentence does not provide any evidence for this. However, San Francisco is known for having a large number of vegetarian and vegan restaurants, so it is the most likely option based on the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
change direction | Knowledge: The sentence states that the wind was heading in one direction and then suddenly changed course, which suggests that it "changed direction." The other options describe different aspects of wind, such as "wave wheat" (a visual effect caused by wind blowing through fields of wheat) or "wind gust" (a sudden burst of wind). "Dry hair" and "blowing hard" are not directly related to the wind changing direction.
military base | Knowledge: Guns and people in uniform are commonly associated with the military. Military bases are locations where military personnel and equipment are stationed, including guns and other weapons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
arena | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the team was traveling for a sporting event, and the equipment manager was responsible for bringing the team's sports equipment off the bus. It makes sense that the equipment would be brought to an arena or stadium where the game or event would be taking place. The other options, such as school, sears, fair, or mall, do not seem to be relevant to the context of the sentence.
house | Knowledge: The phrase "ground floor" refers to the lowest floor of a building, typically where the main entrance is located. While some of the other options (such as a closet or a desk) can also be located on the ground floor, they are not typically associated with this term. Tile and table are not items that typically have a ground floor as they are not buildings.
soft drink | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bee could get stuck easily in a specific location. Soft drinks often contain a sugary substance that attracts bees, and they may accidentally fall into the liquid and become trapped. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ceiling | Knowledge: The question is asking where dust accumulates, meaning where it builds up over time. While dust can accumulate in many places, the context of the question suggests that the answer is a location that is elevated or overhead, such as a ceiling. Dust can also accumulate on surfaces like a desktop or the floor, but those options are not as specific to the context of the question. The library and most buildings are too broad and could apply to many places within those locations, but the ceiling is a clear and specific answer that matches the context of the question.
montana | Knowledge: Montana is a state that is known for having wide-open spaces and a relatively low risk of natural disasters like mudslides, fires, and earthquakes. Additionally, Montana is known to have more lenient zoning codes than some other states, which may make it a better fit for someone who wants to build a ranch house. The other options, such as California or the West in general, have a higher risk of natural disasters and may have more restrictive zoning codes. Outback is not a state, but rather a term used to describe remote areas of Australia. Texas may also have some restrictions around building regulations and has experienced natural disasters in the past.
detachment  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was married to someone who takes everything, which implies a lack of equality and possibly control or abuse in the relationship. After leaving such a relationship, it is common to experience a sense of detachment from the former partner as a way of self-protection and healing. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely outcomes of the situation described.
gain energy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a biological purpose behind eating breakfast, which could involve giving the body energy for the day ahead. Breakfast is often thought to be an important meal because it provides the body with the nutrients needed to fuel physical and mental performance. The other options do not align with this idea and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
potato | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer was using a part of something to plant in the ground, indicating that it must be some sort of seed or sprout. Potatoes have "eyes," which are small buds that sprout into potato plants, so it is likely that the farmer was scooping potato eyes to plant. The other options (elephant, person's head, faces, and mammal) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely candidates for being scooped out and planted in the ground.
heart attacks | Knowledge: The question is asking for the benefit of going jogging in terms of prevention. Heart attacks are commonly associated with a sedentary lifestyle, so engaging in physical activity like jogging can help prevent them. The other options have no clear correlation to jogging or the prevention of heart attacks.
cafeteria | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating together at work, which implies a shared space like a cafeteria. A formal dining room and doing jigsaw puzzles on (assuming the end of the sentence is cut off) are unlikely options in a work setting. A conference room could be an option for some workplaces, but it is less common than a cafeteria. The word "house" is also unlikely since the context of the sentence specifically mentions "at work."
hollow log | Knowledge: Snakes are known to be fond of tight, enclosed spaces where they can hide and feel secure. Hollow logs are a prime target for snakes, as they can easily slip inside and remain hidden from view. The other options have no clear association with snakes or their behavior, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
Washington | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a Pacific beach, which is a geographical clue pointing towards the west coast of North America. Among the options provided, Washington is the only state that is located on the west coast and borders the Pacific Ocean. The other options are either not located in North America or are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
africa | Knowledge: Elephants are most commonly associated with Africa, where they have been native to for thousands of years. While there are also elephants in Asia, particularly in India and parts of Southeast Asia, the sentence does not provide any clear indication that the reference is to Asian elephants. The reference to circus and zoo is not relevant to the origin of elephants.
stolen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the music was downloaded without paying, which indicates that it was obtained illegally. The word "stolen" means taking something without permission, and this makes sense in the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit the context as they do not indicate any illegal act. Opera is a music genre, composed and written on paper are common processes in creating music, and uploaded is a neutral process that does not indicate any action.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location in question is a place where a child may play with a wagon. Out of the given options, a backyard is the most likely spot for a child to play with toys, especially wagons. A field may also be a possibility, but it is less likely than a backyard. A tool box, toy store, and garage are not likely options, as they do not convey the sense of playfulness suggested by the sentence.
inform | Knowledge: A newspaper is a form of media that traditionally provides information about current events, news, and developments to its readers. The word "newspaper" itself suggests that it is a source for new information. Other options such as announce, defend, educate, and communicate may all be a part of what a newspaper does, but informing readers is its primary purpose.
dormitory | Knowledge: In a university setting, a building named "hall" is most likely to be a dormitory, which is a large building that houses students. Conference rooms and small classrooms are typically named after their intended use, while "large building" and "inside" are too vague to provide any clues. "Dormitory" is the only option that fits the context of the question as it is a common type of building found on university campuses that is often referred to as a "hall."
meditation center | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place for relaxation specifically for gentlemen. While some of the options may be relaxing settings (such as a restaurant or cinema), a meditation center is a place that is traditionally associated with relaxation and inner peace. The term "gentleman" may suggest a preference for a peaceful, quiet atmosphere, making a meditation center the most likely option. The other choices do not have a direct connection to relaxation or the specific characteristics of a gentleman's preferred setting.
eye strain | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a potential benefit of using a computer for someone who is blind. Since someone who is blind cannot see the computer screen, they would not experience eye strain from looking at it. The other options are not related to the specific context of computer use for someone who is blind.
put together | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jan is a responsible and efficient person who works in a zoo. The phrase "put together" is commonly used to describe someone who is organized and capable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either refer to things/people unrelated to the situation or have a negative connotation.
venue | Knowledge: A venue is a place where events or performances are held, and it often requires tickets for admission. The other options are not typically associated with concerts or performances. An amusement park and fairgrounds may have performances, but they would not likely require a ticket booth for entry. A toll plaza is a location on a roadway where tolls are collected, and an auditorium may require tickets but is not commonly associated with concerts.
violent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exploring all avenues is important for maintaining peace and preventing something negative from happening. The choice of words, such as "maintain peace" and "avoid," suggests that something bad might happen if peaceful measures are not taken. The use of the word "violent" suggests that this bad thing might be an outbreak of violence. The other options, such as "elusive" and "peacework," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) | Knowledge: Unprotected sex refers to sexual activity without the use of a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom or diaphragm. The most common consequence of unprotected sex is pregnancy, as sperm can fertilize an egg and result in a pregnancy. However, unprotected sex can also result in the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes. Orgasm and giggle are not consequences of unprotected sex, but rather physiological or emotional responses during sexual activity.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that gravity is holding down air, which means the air is located close to the ground. The most logical answer would be the surface of the earth, as that is where the ground and air are in close proximity. The other options, such as sky, space shuttle, cupboard, or house, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not directly related to air being held down by gravity.
homes | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being referred to has had multiple places of residence in their lifetime since they always had a night table in every place they lived. The options "furniture store" and "hallway" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Hotel" could be a possibility, but the use of the word "lived" suggests a more permanent residence, which is why "homes" is the correct choice.
wait turn | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a line outside of the hot-dog stand, which typically means that people are waiting for their turn to order food. "Wait turn" is a phrase commonly used to describe queuing or standing in line to obtain a service. The other options, such as "tickets," "circus act," "polite" and "money from bank," do not make sense in the context of people lining up for food.
work | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lawyers spend a lot of time doing paperwork and researching, which is a key part of their job. The other options such as "food" or "courtroom" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "keep quiet" is not related to a lawyer's job duties. "Office building" could be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "work" and does not capture the essence of what lawyers do.
lose weight | Knowledge: The sentence implies that being fat may motivate a person to do something specific in the gym. The phrase "lose weight" directly addresses the issue of being overweight, which is likely the reason for going to the gym in the first place. The other options are also related to fitness and health, but they are not as directly tied to the issue of weight loss.
carnival | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a ferris wheel, which is typically found at a carnival or fair. Peanuts are also a common snack sold at such events. The other options, such as a barn, ballpark, jar, or plane, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
street | Knowledge: A parking lot is typically accessed from a street or road. A town or neighborhood could contain multiple streets, but the options of strip mall and sewer do not make sense as points of entry for a parking lot.
rotten | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe's food had a bad and bitter taste. "Rotten" is a common cause of bad tasting food, as rotting organic matter can release toxins and produce a sour or bitter flavor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are not related to the idea of bad taste in food.
forest or rainforest | Knowledge: The term "tree hugger" is often used to describe someone who is passionate about environmental conservation and preservation. Forests and rainforests are important ecosystems that are often the focus of conservation efforts, so it is likely that a tree hugger would reside in or near these areas. San Francisco and university do not have a clear connection to environmental conservation, while state park may be a possible location for a tree hugger but it is not as strongly associated with conservation efforts as forests and rainforests.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that working out too hard can have a negative consequence, which is likely to be physical discomfort or pain. Losing weight and loss of water can happen as a result of exercise, but they are not consequences of working out too hard specifically. Exercise and feeling better are benefits of working out, so they cannot be the negative consequence mentioned in the sentence.
building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is in need of shelter from the cold and wet conditions they are experiencing. A building may provide this shelter, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to the need for shelter from the weather. Back home may be an option if it is nearby, but it is not explicitly stated if the person has a home nearby. The hospital and demonstration options do not relate to the person's immediate need for shelter. The bus stop may provide some temporary shelter, but it is not an ideal option for someone who is cold and wet.
boy or girl | Knowledge: Ultrasound is a medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs and tissues. During pregnancy, an ultrasound can be used to determine the sex of the baby. It is not related to the other options, which do not have any clear connection to pregnancy or ultrasound technology.
punishment | Knowledge: The question asks for a bad but frequent reason for hurting someone else. Punishment can be a bad reason because it may lead to further harm, and it does not necessarily address the root cause of the behavior that led to the need for punishment in the first place. The other options do not necessarily imply a direct intent to hurt someone else.
moving car | Knowledge: The phrase "blocking someone in a driveway" suggests that a person is preventing another from being able to move a car out of a parking space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
church | Knowledge: The question implies that a gentleman is looking for a place to go that is not a theater. Out of the choices given, a suit and Europe are not places that one would typically go to. A movie is a form of entertainment, similar to a theater, so it is unlikely that this would be the correct answer. A garden is also a leisurely place, but it may not be appropriate for a gentleman in certain contexts. On the other hand, going to church is a common option for many people, including gentlemen, seeking places to go outside of the theater.
motor vehicle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the windshield is used to protect from spray and wind, which is a common feature of motor vehicles such as cars. While motorboats and airplanes also have windscreens, they are not typically described as being used for "spray", which suggests that they are not the correct answer. While motorcycles also have windscreens, the sentence does not specify that the windshield is on a motorcycle, but instead uses the more general term "motor vehicle".
stretch | Knowledge: After heavy exercise, muscles can become sore and tense. Stretching can help alleviate muscle stiffness and restore flexibility. Therefore, it is likely that a person who exercised heavily the day before will stretch when they wake up to helps loosen their muscles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the effects of heavy exercise on the body.
police station | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a police officer who is not stopping cars but who is outside. The only logical choice is the police station, as police officers are often outside the station interacting with the public or taking a break. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
newspaper office | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about a workplace that employs a large number of writers for a daily publication. This context is most commonly associated with newspaper offices, where reporters and writers work to produce daily news articles for publication. While universities may also employ writers, they typically do not produce daily publications. Factories and advertising firms are also unlikely to employ a large number of writers, and may not produce written content on a daily basis.
think | Knowledge: The word "profound" suggests that the question was deep and thought-provoking, which would likely prompt the students to stop and consider their answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of a profound question.
belfry | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a bat being abducted and absconded, which suggests a location where bats might be found. A belfry is a tower or room in a church or building where bells are hung, and is commonly associated with bats due to their tendency to roost in these areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sporting event | Knowledge: The word "athletes" suggests that the context is related to sports. The only option that is clearly connected to sports is "sporting event". The other options are not related to athletics or cheering for athletes. A movie theater typically shows movies, a theatre typically shows plays or musicals, a church typically holds religious services, and a concert typically features musical performances.
downtown area | Knowledge: The sentence states that the nightclub owner was not skilled in business, but the club still did well. This suggests that the success of the club was due to factors outside of the owner's control, such as the location. The option "downtown area" fits this context because prime locations for nightclubs are often found in busy areas with a lot of foot traffic and entertainment options. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
visual  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a television allows you to take in both audio and visual information. While it may also provide entertainment and news, these options are not specific to the question being asked. Eye strain and boredom are not types of information that a television can provide.
chicago | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a city known for having great pizza places. Chicago is famous for its deep-dish pizza, and is often considered one of the best cities for pizza lovers. Buffalo and Little Italy are known for having great Italian food, but not necessarily specifically for pizza. Food court is a generic term for a shopping mall dining area and is not a city. Capital cities can have great food, but this does not give enough information to determine which city is specifically known for its pizzerias.
tree  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer should relate to something in the woods that provides shelter. Trees are commonly found in wooded areas and often offer shelter to animals and humans alike from the elements. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gum tree | Knowledge: The sentence implies that koalas typically live in a certain type of environment or tree, which the koala in question could not find. The phrase "it made its home at the top of something else" suggests that the koala found a substitute habitat, which in this case is likely to be a gum tree. Gum trees are native to Australia and are known to be a common habitat for koalas. The other options do not relate to the natural habitat of koalas.
lawyer | Knowledge: Divorce is a legal process that involves navigating complex laws and regulations. A lawyer is a trained legal professional who can provide guidance and assist with filing the necessary paperwork. The other options do not provide any clear direction on who to speak with regarding a divorce.
all of the above, depending on the type of furnace and the specific home design  | Knowledge: Furnaces can be located in a variety of places within a home, depending on the type of furnace being used and the layout of the home. Some furnaces may be located in a designated boiler room, while others may be in a basement or cellar. In some houses, the furnace may be located in a separate room or closet within the living space. Therefore, depending on the specific home and furnace, the location could potentially be any of the options given.
catch cold | Knowledge: Kissing outside can expose an individual to cold temperatures, which can cause them to catch a cold. This is a common health concern associated with being outside in colder weather. While sexual stimulation can also occur during kissing, it is not necessarily a guaranteed result of kissing outside. Herpes and outbursts are not typically associated with kissing outside.
obesity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was consuming more calories than they were burning, which is a common cause of obesity. Obesity is a medical condition that occurs when a person's body mass index (BMI) is above a certain threshold, usually around 30. The other choices are not relevant to the context of the sentence - feeling full may be a consequence of overeating, but it does not relate to the medical condition of obesity.
art show | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that wine and cheese were served after everyone saw exhibits and installations. This suggests that the location was most likely an art show or exhibition. The other options (bar, cemetery, spaghetti sauce, liquor store) do not make sense in this context.
motel | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man is tired and seeking accommodations, which suggests that he is looking for a place to sleep for the night. The options "theater" and "camp ground" do not offer sleeping accommodations, while "comfort" is too vague and could refer to anything from a comfortable bed to a cozy blanket. "Motel" is the most logical choice as it is a common type of lodging that offers rooms for overnight stays.
classroom | Knowledge: A notebook is often used to take notes in a learning environment such as a classroom. The other options, such as a bookstore, kitchen table, backpack, or office, may not necessarily have the same association with note-taking as a classroom does.
careless | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady responsible for the shift was not good at her job, and was always lacking in some way towards the needs of the seniors. The word "careless" is the closest match to that description, as it implies a lack of attention or concern for one's duties. The other options (antipathy, disinterest, negligence, and indifferent) all suggest a lack of caring, but may not necessarily be associated with someone who is responsible for caregiving.
baseball stadium | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the professional team "Tigers" playing a game, which suggests that the context of the sentence is related to a baseball game. The word "professional" also suggests that the game is being played at a high level, which implies that it is likely taking place in a baseball stadium. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
inside | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the answer relates to the field of architecture. The options "table," "restaurant," and "synagogue" are not relevant to architecture, while "all buildings" is a generalization that ignores the fact that some buildings are not enclosed structures (e.g., bridges, observation towers, etc.). Therefore, the answer must be "inside," as all buildings are typically found within some sort of enclosure.
cat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who is lonely may buy something for companionship. The option "girlfriend" could be a possibility, but it would not be something that "everybody" buys as it requires finding a willing partner. "Happy" and "believed" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Grow old" is not something that can be bought. A pet, such as a cat, is a common choice for someone seeking companionship, especially if they are lonely.
leash | Knowledge: The question suggests that the dog is biting nearby people, which is an unsafe behavior. Using a rope or porch do not seem like effective methods to stop the dog from biting, as they do not have a direct correlation to controlling the dog's behavior. The front door and backyard also do not offer effective solutions to the problem. Using a leash, however, can help control the dog's movements and prevent it from biting nearby people.
changing behavior | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Linda feels guilty about her actions and wants to talk to someone in order to improve her behavior. The phrase "first step" implies that talking to someone is the beginning of a process, and the most logical process that follows talking about bad behavior would be trying to change or improve that behavior. The other options, such as hurt feelings or dry mouth, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
all of the above | Knowledge: Drinking a lot of alcohol can lead to various negative consequences such as injuries (due to impaired judgment and coordination), doing stupid things (due to impaired decision-making abilities), amnesia (as a result of blackouts), hangover (due to dehydration and other physiological effects), and drunkenness (the obvious state of being heavily intoxicated). As such, all of the listed choices can be correct answers to the question.
growth | Knowledge: The phrase "making grow" is a clue that the answer is related to the process of growth. This suggests that the correct answer should reflect a positive outcome that results from growth. "Die" and "aging" are both associated with negative outcomes, while "harvesting" is more closely related to the end of the growth process, rather than the result of growth itself. "Plants" is too broad a term and doesn't provide a specific outcome related to growth.
sleepy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam had stayed awake throughout the night, which would likely leave him feeling exhausted or sleepy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - anxious would suggest he was worried or nervous, frenzied would suggest he was in a panic or frenzy, frustrated would suggest he was annoyed or irritated, and flustered would suggest he was nervous or agitated.
gain respect | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person wants to do something to get a promotion at work, and the choice that is most likely to help them achieve this goal is to gain respect. This can be done by working hard, being reliable, having a positive attitude, and demonstrating competence in their job. Smiling and planting flowers may be seen as positive traits, but they are unlikely to be the primary factors that influence a promotion decision. Promising to do something is also not a reliable way to get a promotion, as it may not be feasible or may not be seen as a significant contribution to the company. Fishing in a lake is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
liberal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's beliefs and practices are traditional and strict, which is in opposition to his roommate who is described as the opposite. The word "orthodox" specifically implies adherence to established beliefs and practices, which suggests that the correct answer will be an antonym that represents a more free-thinking or unorthodox perspective. Of the given options, only "liberal" fits this description. The other options either have negative connotations (heretical, recalcitrant) or are specific to a certain religious denomination (conservadox, catholic) and do not fit the context of the sentence.
music shop | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person needs supplies for a bass instrument, and the most likely place to find those supplies would be a music shop. A music shop would have a variety of strings and accessories for bass guitars, as well as other types of bass instruments commonly used in orchestral or marching band settings. A manual would not provide the necessary supplies, and the options of orchestra and marching band are not relevant to the context.
desk | Knowledge: The personal telephone directory is typically used by an individual to record the contact numbers of their acquaintances, friends, or family members. Since it is a personal document, it is likely to be kept in a location that is easily accessible to the owner, such as a desk. A desk is also a common place to keep important documents and records. The other options, such as office, building, or phone booth, do not necessarily suggest a personal location where an individual would keep their personal telephone directory.
cow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Frankie found a bone in her food, so it is most likely that the bone belongs to an animal source rather than a human source. The options "father" and "arm" are not related to food and do not make sense in the context. "Museum" is also not related to the context and is an unlikely option for a bone found in food. The option "human body" is unlikely because it would raise significant health concerns if a human bone was found in food. Therefore, the most likely option is that the bone belonged to a cow, which is a common source of meat in many dishes.
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the medics were in a highly emotional and urgent state, indicating that the situation was dire. The fact that they were concerned about the patient losing consciousness implies that they were at risk of dying. The other options do not fit the context or severity of the situation described.
valley | Knowledge: The word "solitary" suggests that the apple trees are growing alone or in small numbers. A valley is a low-lying area surrounded by hills or mountains and may be less favorable for planting large orchards, making it a more likely location for solitary apple trees. The other options, such as orchard and fields, imply larger areas of land dedicated to growing crops, making it less likely for apple trees to be growing alone. Pennsylvania and park are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
patio | Knowledge: A doormat is usually placed at the entrance of a building or a house to help keep the inside clean. While it is possible for a patio to have a doormat, it is less common because patios are typically outside and not considered part of the interior of a building. The other options listed are all common locations where one would expect to find a doormat.
doorway | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student wanted to be left alone during finals week, which implies that they were in a private or semi-private space like a dorm room or apartment where someone might knock on the door. A "do not disturb" sign is often used in situations where someone wants privacy or is trying to focus, so it makes sense that the sign would be placed in a doorway to indicate that the student did not want to be disturbed while inside their room. None of the other options provide a clear indication of where the student might have placed the sign.
own house | Knowledge: The sentence states that the small dog picked up the newspaper from the driveway, which implies that the dog had access to the outside of a house. The option "own house" is the only one that indicates a possible ownership of a property where the dog could live and perform these actions. The other options are either irrelevant or suggest different living arrangements for the dog.
new york | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the day traders were on a trading floor, which is most likely located in a financial hub such as New York City. The fact that they celebrated at a steak house also indicates that they were in a city or town with access to upscale dining. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
effectiveness | Knowledge: The question is asking about what is important for a student's ability to learn, which suggests that the answer needs to relate to how students learn. The term "effectiveness" suggests that the answer is related to how well a student is able to learn and retain information, and how successful they are at applying what they have learned. The other options (learn more, distress, dysfunction, intelligence) do not directly relate to the process of learning or how successful a student is at it.
knowledge of | Knowledge: The question is asking for the best way to understand a theory better, which suggests that the answer should involve improving one's understanding or knowledge of the theory. Effort and time may be important factors in studying a theory, but they do not necessarily lead to better understanding on their own. Thinking may be a part of the process of understanding a theory, but it is not a complete answer. Singing is not relevant to the question. Therefore, knowledge of the theory is the best answer.
panic | Knowledge: The word "crisis" suggests a situation of extreme danger or difficulty. In such circumstances, people often experience fear and anxiety, which can lead to panic. Panic is a common response to crisis situations, as it is a natural instinct to try and protect oneself from harm. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not related to crisis situations or do not reflect a common human response to crisis.
sidewalk | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a common place in school where students put their gum, and the word "stick" suggests that it is not a designated location. The options "books," "shelf," "water fountain," and "movies" do not make logical sense as places to put gum, while "sidewalk" is a common location where people may discard gum.
stay home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person who was invited to the party is not comfortable in social situations. 'Stay home' is the most appropriate choice in this scenario since it implies that the person will not attend the party and avoid socializing altogether. The other options like 'meeting', 'medium', 'blowing off steam', and 'studying' have no relation with the context of the sentence.
deflation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ECB's sole focus on fighting inflation had negative consequences, which is often associated with deflation. Deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services, which can lead to a decrease in consumer spending and investment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children enjoy playing, which is often associated with having fun. Playing with toys and using their imagination are ways that children often have fun, while going to the movies and reading to may not be as enjoyable for some children. Therefore, the most likely answer is "have fun".
bright light | Knowledge: Shadows are cast when an object blocks the path of light, creating a shadow on the surface behind it. Bright light sources, such as the sun or a lamp, are often the source of the light that casts a shadow. The other options are not likely to be the source of a shadow, as a walking man or a bridge would not typically cast a significant shadow, and the ground and daytime are not sources of light themselves.
discomfort | Knowledge: The question suggests that the high temperature is causing discomfort for the person. Discomfort can cause a person to wake up in the middle of the night and be unable to go back to sleep. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
comic book | Knowledge: The phrase "special abilities far beyond normal ferrets" suggests that this is a fictional or fantastical ferret. Comic books often feature characters with unusual abilities or powers, making it a likely source for learning about this kind of ferret. The other options, such as being outdoors or in a specific location, do not seem relevant to learning about a unique ferret. Redwall is a book series featuring animal characters, but there is no indication that it specifically includes a ferret with exceptional abilities.
basket | Knowledge: The question suggests that the small dog has trouble peeing indoors, so the correct answer would be where the dog should sleep. The options "water," "kennel," and "ASPCA" do not make sense in this context since they are not related to where the dog should sleep. "Person's home" could be a possibility, but it is too broad and not specific enough. "Basket" is the best answer since it implies a cozy space for a small dog to sleep comfortably and may be easier to clean if the dog has accidents.
slow down | Knowledge: Police cars are often associated with enforcing speed limits and traffic laws, which can cause other drivers to slow down when they see a police car on the road. Pitting refers to a dangerous maneuver where a police car intentionally collides with another vehicle, which is not a common behavior associated with police cars. Cost money, get to town, and move people do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
go somewhere | Knowledge: The question is asking for advice on how to satisfy curiosity about another location, which can best be achieved by physically going there. The other options do not involve any sort of exploration or firsthand experience of the location. Seeing a favorite show, hearing the news, and eating lunch do not involve leaving your current location or learning more about the location you are curious about. Reading a book may provide some information, but it is not the same as experiencing the location firsthand.
solar system | Knowledge: Our sun is the center of our solar system, which consists of eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies that orbit around it. The other options are not accurate, as the universe is much larger than just our solar system, outer space is the vast expanse beyond our planet, a star is a celestial object like the sun, and beans have no relation to astronomy.
painting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John hung something on his wall after returning from a trip to the west coast. The fact that it mentions a fox implies that the item hung on the wall was a representation of a fox, likely a painting or a taxidermied animal. The other choices do not align with the context of the sentence.
art show | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for inspiration for original paintings to put on their wall. Art shows are a great source of inspiration for original paintings as they showcase unique and diverse works of art by various artists. Classrooms, labyrinths, corners, and paint stores do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence and are less likely to provide inspiration for original paintings.
swimming pool | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that kids would go to a place where they could cool off if it's hot outside. A swimming pool is a common place where people go to swim and cool off on hot days. The other options, such as a lake, toy store or Disneyland, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence. A park may offer shade but doesn't necessarily provide a way to cool off on a hot day.
dairy farm | Knowledge: A heifer is a young female cow, and since she appears pleased with herself, it suggests that she may have just given birth or been recently milked. This would be more likely to occur on a dairy farm, where cows are specifically raised for their milk production. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
learn from | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a lecture happening and that the listener should pay attention to it. Paying attention to the lecture will enable the listener to gain knowledge or learn something from it. The other options may be related to the lecture, but they do not directly suggest what the listener should do during the lecture, unlike "learn from".
neatness | Knowledge: The question suggests that the act of cleaning the house will result in a particular outcome. The word "neatness" implies that cleaning the house will result in a clean and organized living space. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Order" is similar to neatness, but it does not necessarily imply cleanliness. "Tiredness" implies that cleaning the house will be physically exhausting, which is not necessarily the outcome the question is asking about. "Pass out" implies a very negative outcome, while "invigorating" implies a positive and energizing outcome, both of which are unlikely outcomes of cleaning the house.
throw up | Knowledge: Drinking too much alcohol can cause nausea, dizziness, and vomiting, which may explain why someone who drinks too much liquor is likely to throw up. Stumbling may also be a symptom of intoxication, but it is not a direct consequence of drinking too much liquor. Food and coffee are not related to the effects of alcohol, and choking is a more severe reaction that is not commonly associated with alcohol consumption.
Mediterranean sea | Knowledge: Jellyfish are generally found in ocean and sea water, not in human hands, supermarkets, or stores. The Mediterranean sea is a known location where jellyfish can be found, making it the most likely choice among the options given.
labyrinth | Knowledge: A labyrinth is a maze-like structure with a series of pathways that can be confusing to navigate. It is easy to get lost in a labyrinth and end up at a dead end, which can feel like running into a wall when trying to leave. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
melt | Knowledge: The question is asking about a change that has occurred to ice, specifically one that would result in it no longer being ice. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid state, which would explain why it is no longer considered to be ice. The other options are not applicable because they do not involve a change in the state of the ice.
hideous | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man's facial injury was devastating and has affected his appearance in a negative way, leading him to believe that the woman he is looking at could never love him. The word "hideous" best describes something that is extremely ugly and unpleasant to look at. The other options do not carry the same weight of negative connotation as "hideous" and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
four legs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dogs are active and move around a lot, which requires them to have some physical ability to do so. The most obvious physical characteristic that allows dogs to move around quickly and easily is having four legs. The other options, such as pointed ears or fleas, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
exhaustion | Knowledge: Running a marathon, which is approximately 26 miles, is an extremely physically demanding activity that can lead to extreme exhaustion for most people. It is not uncommon for marathon runners to feel completely drained after completing the race, as they have just exerted an enormous amount of energy. While injuries and other complications can occur during a marathon, the other answer choices (excruciating pain, bloody legs, death, and passing out) are not typical or desirable outcomes of running a marathon.
subway | Knowledge: The phrase "automated ticket booth" suggests a location where tickets can be purchased without the help of a human clerk. Train stations and subways often have automated ticket booths for convenience and efficiency, whereas baby stores and auditoriums typically do not require ticket purchases. While a clerk may be present at a ticket booth, the phrase "automated" implies that the booth does not rely on human assistance. Therefore, the best answer is "subway".
rest area | Knowledge: A rest area is a location usually found along highways or interstates where drivers can stop to take a rest, use the restroom, and stretch their legs. Rest areas typically do not have beds available for use, making this choice the correct answer. The other options all commonly have beds available, such as in a hotel room, hospital room, or neighbor's house. A loft may or may not have a bed, but it would not be unusual to find one there.
feeble | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite being old, the bull had a lot of energy for a certain activity. The word "feeble" means weak and lacking physical strength, which contradicts the idea that the bull still had enough energy for sex. The other options, such as "charge rider" and "bullbleep," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Female" and "cow" are both incorrect because the sentence specifies that the subject of the sentence is a bull, which is a male bovine.
Indian Ocean | Knowledge: The question implies that the Antarctic Ocean is named after a continent, which means that we are looking for another ocean that is named after a landmass. The Atlantic and Pacific oceans are not named after specific landmasses, while the Indian Ocean is named after the landmass of India. Therefore, the correct answer is Indian Ocean. The last option is incorrect because it is a duplicate of a previous option.
food store | Knowledge: Grapes are a common fruit found in food stores, supermarkets, and grocery stores. They are typically sold in large quantities, either packaged in bags or sold by weight. While grapes can be grown in a field or wine country, these locations are not typical places to purchase them directly. Lunch boxes and vending machines also do not typically offer fresh produce like grapes.
sickness | Knowledge: Drinking too much alcohol can lead to various negative effects on the body, including sickness, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Becoming drunk and having fun are also possible effects, but they are not necessarily negative or guaranteed to happen to everyone who drinks too much. Active and frequent urination may be a result of drinking a lot of fluids but are not directly related to the consumption of alcohol itself.
expensive | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the office is in need of new computers, but upgrading them would be a challenge for some reason. The context of the sentence indicates that the issue is related to money, since the word "expensive" is a common adjective used to describe something that costs a lot. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb," "fun," and "fast" are not related to the function or cost of the computers, and "do work" is too vague to be a plausible answer.
clap hands | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject being discussed is excited babies. Although babies may not be able to make the same noise as adults when applauding, the sentence implies that they still engage in some form of clapping when excited. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laboratory | Knowledge: White rats are often used in laboratories for scientific experiments due to their ease of handling, breeding, and predictable behavior. They are particularly useful for studying genetics and behavior, and are often bred specifically for research purposes. The other options are unlikely places to find a white rat, as they are not natural habitats or common locations for white rats to be kept.
very deep | Knowledge: The question is asking about the reason for the biodiversity in the oceans, which could be influenced by various environmental factors. The phrase "so many different creatures" suggests that there is a high level of species diversity. One possible factor that could contribute to this is the depth of the ocean. The deeper parts of the ocean have unique environmental conditions such as extreme pressure, cold temperatures, and lack of light, which could provide habitats for different types of creatures. The other options do not have a clear connection to the question or the context of the oceans.
brown meat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the main ingredient for the tacos needs to be cooked in a hot pan. The phrase "brown meat" is commonly used when cooking ground beef, which is a common ingredient in tacos. The other options do not match the context of the sentence as they either refer to general cooking instructions or are too broad.
studio | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is playing an acoustic guitar while wearing headphones and sitting in a booth with a window, which suggests a soundproof recording studio setting. It is common for musicians to play while wearing headphones to listen to themselves or the other musicians they are playing with, and a soundproof booth with a window allows for visual communication while minimizing sound interference. The other options, such as a music shop or closet, do not match the context of the sentence.
pass course | Knowledge: The context of the question is about a student's performance in school sessions. To perform well in school sessions, a basic expectation would be to pass the courses being taken. This means achieving a satisfactory level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter. While studying history and asking questions are also important aspects of learning and becoming a successful student, they do not necessarily indicate a student's overall performance in school sessions. Similarly, "Michigan" is not relevant to the context of the question, and "better grade" is too vague to be a correct answer.
crumpled | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the paper is no longer needed and is being thrown away. The word "crumpled" suggests that the paper will be crumpled up into a ball before being discarded. The other options do not fit the context of throwing away paper, such as "read" or "coloured." "Saturated with water" may be a possibility if the paper needs to be destroyed for confidential reasons, but it is not a common action for disposing of unwanted paper. "One dimensional" does not make sense in the context of disposing of paper.
people | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the shopping center was crowded and difficult to navigate, suggesting that there were a lot of people in the area. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for the overcrowding of the shopping center. Urban areas, suburbs, stores, and children may all be present in a shopping center, but they do not necessarily cause crowding on their own.
drink water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dogs become hot and tired, which can dehydrate them. It then implies that they do something "sloppily," which could be interpreted as a behavior that is not well-controlled or refined. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that the behavior being referenced is drinking water, which dogs may do messily or eagerly when they are thirsty. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
shore | Knowledge: The question suggests that the jellyfish being referred to is in its natural habitat and not kept in captivity. A shore is a location where jellyfish can be found in their natural habitat, typically in the ocean or other bodies of water. A store, tank, river, or movie are not typically associated with finding live jellyfish in their natural habitat.
closet | Knowledge: A vacuum is a household appliance that is commonly used for cleaning floors, carpets, and other surfaces. It is typically stored in a closet or storage room when not in use. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Space and orbit refer to outer space, which is not a likely storage location for a household appliance. Dyson is a brand of vacuum, but it is not a location where a vacuum might be stored. Container is too vague and could refer to many different types of storage containers.
bar | Knowledge: Stools are often found in bars as they are a common seating option at the bar counter. The other options do not have any clear association with stools.
endangered | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the buffalo population suffered greatly due to hunting, which caused their numbers to become scarce. The word "endangered" indicates that the buffalo are still at risk of becoming extinct, but efforts have been made to increase their numbers. The other options imply that the buffalo are no longer in danger or that they were never in danger at all, which does not fit the context of the sentence.
very important | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher emphasized the importance of the topic by indicating that it would appear on the test. Therefore, everything the students were learning about the topic was likely very important for them to know. The other options do not reflect the gravity of the situation or the teacher's emphasis on the topic's significance.
anguish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the father is upset about the lack of justice being served, which implies that he is experiencing emotions related to sadness or disappointment. Out of the options given, anguish is the best fit for such a scenario, as it refers to severe mental or physical pain or suffering. Revenge, retaliation, and going to jail do not fit the context of the sentence, while remorse implies that the father was somehow responsible for the man's release, which is not mentioned in the sentence.
high school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that teenagers dislike going somewhere, but have a reason to attend anyway. This description fits most closely with high school, as many teenagers may not enjoy attending school but are incentivized to attend by the need to receive an education and graduate. The other options are not usually associated with being mandatory or necessary for teenagers to attend.
to give the ark more diversity | Knowledge: The question is referencing the story of Noah's Ark, in which it is said that every kind of animal was represented. The idea of having different kinds of dogs is connected to the need to have a diverse collection of animals, so that the world could be repopulated after the flood. The other options do not provide any clear explanation for why there are different kinds of dogs.
farmer's field | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that an agricultural specialist was walking from row to row, which suggests that he was likely in a location where crops were being grown. This narrows down the choices to farmer's field and vegetable garden. However, the context of the sentence suggests a larger area, so farmer's field is the more accurate choice. The other options, such as sequence of similar things or auditorium, do not fit the context of the sentence.
in kentucky | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about the location of the world's most famous horse race, implying that there is a particular event that holds this distinction. Kentucky is known for its horse racing culture and hosts the Kentucky Derby, which is widely considered the most famous horse race in the world. The other options offered do not have any clear connection to horse racing or famous events.
clear | Knowledge: The word "ambiguous" means unclear or having multiple possible interpretations. Therefore, the opposite of ambiguous would be something that is clear and has a single interpretation. The words "certain," "distinct," and "explicit" all suggest something that is clear and specific. The word "blurry" suggests the opposite of clear, so it is not the correct choice.
pleasurable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that kissing is being described. Kissing is often associated with pleasure, as it can be a physically enjoyable experience. The other options may also be associated with kissing to some degree, but they do not fit as well with the idea that kissing is often pleasurable.
win game | Knowledge: Monopoly is a board game where players compete to be the last one remaining in the game by accumulating as much wealth and property as possible. The game ends when one person has achieved a certain level of success, in this case, winning the game. The other options do not reflect the objective or rules of Monopoly.
play games | Knowledge: The sentence implies that children are engaging in some activity while in the car, and the options provided all suggest possible activities that children can do. However, throwing things does not seem like a desirable activity and saying the alphabet is more of an educational task than a play activity. On the other hand, hearing stories, playing with toys, and playing games are all common ways for children to pass the time and stay entertained during car rides. However, since the sentence specifically asks about what children like to do, playing games seems like the most appropriate answer as it allows for creativity and interaction with others.
apartment | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason to buy new cups when moving into a specific location - the city. When moving into a new apartment, it is common to purchase new kitchen supplies, including cups. The other choices do not have a clear connection to buying new cups when moving into a city.
embrace | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not abandon his son, meaning he did not leave or neglect him. Instead, he did something else to him. Out of the given choices, "embrace" is the most appropriate, as it means to hold someone tightly and show affection or acceptance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
village | Knowledge: The description suggests that James lives in a place where there are many cottages, which is a common feature of villages. Additionally, the fact that he enjoys drawing pictures of the cottages and people in the area and sharing them with others implies that it is a community where people know and interact with each other. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
running out of money | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone would stop buying products, which implies that they were previously buying products. Of the choices provided, running out of money is the most plausible reason for someone to stop buying products. Comparison shopping refers to the process of comparing prices and features of different products before making a purchase, so it doesn't necessarily lead someone to stop buying products altogether. Overstocking refers to having an excess of products, which is not related to why someone would stop buying products. Spending money and bankruptcy are related to financial difficulties, but running out of money is a more general and likely reason for someone to stop buying products.
Germany | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a location where one can drive unrestricted on a superhighway, which is commonly associated with the autobahn in Germany. The autobahn is known for having stretches without a speed limit, allowing drivers to travel unrestricted. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Laddie's dental office is the only one in the area, which implies that it is located in a small town or a rural area. It is unlikely that Laddie would reside in the dental office or an office building, as those are not typically used as living spaces. "Main street" and "patient" are not likely options either, as they do not necessarily indicate where Laddie might live.
have sex | Knowledge: The other choices are all related to things a child might not want to do or might be restricted from doing, but "have sex" is not appropriate for a child to engage in and therefore can be eliminated as the correct choice.
cup | Knowledge: In this context, the question is asking for a container that can hold water for the dog to drink from. A cup is a logical choice because it is a common household item that can hold liquids, and it is small enough for the dog to easily drink from. The other options (empty bottle, can, cabinet, backpack) do not provide a good solution for the dog's need to drink water.
straight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the round piece of road was effective at slowing down traffic, while something else was not as effective at stopping traffic completely. The word "long" could indicate that the other option is a long, straight road, which may not have enough obstacles or turns to slow down traffic effectively. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dependence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that some people have a belief that providing aid to those in need can create a dependency, meaning that the individuals become reliant on the assistance and lose the ability to provide for themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is dependence. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence or convey a negative connotation.
suicide | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was experiencing extreme hardship, which can lead to depression and thoughts of suicide. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence. "Grief" may be a natural response to difficulty in life but it does not specifically suggest an action that the person took. "Going to jail" and "not living" are not logical responses to a difficult life situation. "Writing his congressman" may be a course of action for some, but it does not address the severity of the situation described in the sentence.
disciplined | Knowledge: The question is about finding a fun way to get in shape, but the word "disciplined" suggests that the answer may not be something that is inherently fun. A disciplined approach to fitness may involve sticking to a workout routine, eating a healthy diet, and setting achievable goals. While these activities may not be immediately enjoyable, they can result in long-term benefits and a sense of accomplishment. The other options do not have a direct connection to the idea of getting in shape. "Sitting down" and "overweight" may even hinder fitness goals, while "sex" and "feeling good" may have some health benefits but may not be reliable methods for achieving overall fitness.
nightmares | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monsters in the dream are causing fear or unease, which is a common experience during a nightmare. Nightmares are often associated with scary or disturbing images and can create a sense of confusion and frightening experience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cellar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the canned vegetables need to be stored over the winter, indicating that they are to be kept long-term. The microwave and salad are not suitable storage options as they are not designed for long-term storage. The farmer's market is a place where vegetables are sold, not stored. Store is too broad and could refer to any type of storage location. The cellar is a common storage location for canned goods as it is a cool and dry space that can help preserve their shelf life.
store | Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to get furniture from, indicating that the options should be places where furniture is sold or obtained. The option "room" is not a place where furniture can be obtained or purchased. "Warehouse" and "loft" could be places where furniture is stored or made but not necessarily where it is sold. "Rug" is only a type of furniture and not a place where it can be obtained. "Store" is the most appropriate option as it is a place where furniture is usually sold.
plate | Knowledge: The fork is a common utensil used for eating food, and it is typically placed on a plate during meal times. The other options, such as video game, kitchen drawer, table, and road, have no clear connection to the context of the question and would not be a logical place for a fork to belong.
hydration | Knowledge: Drinking water is known to have a hydrating effect on most humans, as it helps to replenish the fluids lost through sweating, urination, and other bodily processes. This can also lead to the need to urinate more frequently, as excess fluids are excreted from the body. Swallowing is the act of ingesting food or beverages and does not necessarily refer to the effects of drinking water specifically. Sickness and runny nose are not typically associated with drinking water, unless the water is contaminated.
trouble | Knowledge: The use of the word "always" suggests that the answer relates to a recurring situation that the president finds themselves in, rather than a physical location. Out of the options provided, only "trouble" fits this criteria, as it implies that the president is often involved in controversy or difficulty. The other options (building, white house, board room, limousine) are all physical locations that the president may be in, but do not provide a fitting answer to the question.
music store | Knowledge: A fiddle is a type of musical instrument commonly used in folk or country music. As such, it's likely that one would find it in a music store, which is a place that sells musical instruments. The other options - dance hall, orchestra, Tennessee, and rock concert - do not necessarily imply that a fiddle would be present.
countryside | Knowledge: The question suggests that the sloth was taken from its natural habitat or environment. Wilderness and countryside are both options that could refer to a natural setting. Encyclopedia, school, and dictionary do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
stagger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's condition was a result of his decision to get drunk. The word "hangover" implies that he consumed a significant amount of alcohol the night before, which would have affected his ability to walk steadily or maintain his balance. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be "stagger," which means to walk unsteadily as if about to fall, and is commonly associated with the effects of alcohol consumption. The other options, such as "get arrested" or "sleep over," are not related to the context of the sentence.
cultural revolution | Knowledge: The term "changing society" implies a desire for significant transformation in the way things are currently done. A cultural revolution involves changing the values, beliefs, and norms of a society, which would align with the idea of wanting a significant societal change. The other options, such as new laws, confusion and chaos, happiness for, and train, do not necessarily indicate a desire for a major societal change.
though | Knowledge: The question is asking for an illogically spelled word, which means it may have unconventional or irregular spelling. "Though" is a commonly misspelled word because of the silent "gh" at the end, and it may not follow normal English spelling patterns. The other options do not have any known spelling irregularities.
increased efficiency | Knowledge: The question asks why someone would want to use a computer, and one of the choices, increased efficiency, is a benefit often associated with computer use. Computers can streamline tasks and automate processes, allowing individuals to complete work faster and with greater accuracy. The other choices, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain, are negative effects of computer use that may be avoided with proper ergonomic practices or breaks from screen time. Work and pleasure are general reasons for computer use, but they do not provide specific benefits or reasons for using a computer.
music store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking for a place to physically try out keyboard instruments before making a purchase. A music store would be the most likely option as they typically have a selection of instruments for customers to try out. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a band or orchestra may not necessarily have multiple keyboard instruments available for someone to try out, accompanying a singer may not require a keyboard specifically, and a museum likely would not have playable keyboard instruments available for visitors.
study books  | Knowledge: A library is a place where books are kept and people are expected to engage in activities related to reading and learning. Studies by librarianships show that libraries are quiet places where people go to read and work on their studies. Therefore, the most likely activity taking place in a library is studying books, which distinguishes it as a resourceful place for research and information gathering. The other options given in the choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are therefore not suitable answers.
entertainment | Knowledge: Playing games is often seen as a form of entertainment and is viewed as an engaging activity that people engage in to relax and have fun. While people may enjoy playing games competitively or become excited when they win, entertainment is the most common reason people play games. Anger is generally not a desirable emotion associated with playing games, so that option can be eliminated as well.
keeping quiet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the women were previously keeping quiet about an issue and decided to finally talk about it. This implies that they had been staying silent or sitting silently before. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to the idea of speaking up about an issue.
dressing room | Knowledge: Mirrors are commonly found in dressing rooms or areas where people get ready, such as bedrooms or closets. The use of the word "usually" implies that this question is asking about the typical or expected location for a mirror to be long, and dressing rooms are often designed with mirrors that extend from floor to ceiling to provide a full-length reflection. The other options, such as a car or shoe store, do not typically have mirrors that are long in length.
pine tree | Knowledge: Bald eagles are known for perching on tall trees, especially pine trees, in order to spot prey and protect their nests. While they can be found in many places, including Canada and wildlife refuges, the specific question asks where they would land, suggesting a preference for a specific type of location. Open country and on a lake are less likely choices since they are not typical perching spots for bald eagles.
reflection | Knowledge: The use of the word "contemplating" suggests that the student was deep in thought and considering different aspects of the problem. The phrase "that's when he made the" implies that the student did something intentional that led to the answer, indicating an active process of problem-solving. The word "reflection" fits in with this line of thinking, as it suggests a period of introspection or careful consideration that leads to a breakthrough. The other choices - action, discovery, deciding, and thinking - are all possible outcomes of reflection, but they do not fit as neatly with the context of the sentence.
map | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the astronaut was looking for a specific location, namely, the United States, and needed a tool to help him navigate from outer space. An atlas or history book may provide information about the country's history or geography, but a map is the most specific and practical tool for locating a specific point on the Earth's surface. The option "towards ocean" is too vague and doesn't provide the necessary information to pinpoint a specific location. The northern hemisphere is a large area that encompasses many countries and doesn't provide the necessary specificity to answer the question.
cakewalk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Devil's food is a prize that you can win at a fundraising game that is commonly played at churches. The only option that fits this context is cakewalk, which is a popular game played at carnivals and fundraisers where players walk around a circle while music plays, and when the music stops, they must stop on a number. The number corresponds to a cake, which the winner gets to take home. The other options, such as satanism and yoke devil, do not make sense in this context.
commit crime | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the company's auditors are concerned about the speaker's practices, which implies that there may be some ethical or legal concerns involved. The phrase "commit crime" directly relates to this interpretation and is the most appropriate answer. The other options do not address the context of the sentence or provide a logical connection to the idea of auditors being worried about the speaker's practices.
buffet | Knowledge: In the context of the question, "filling a salad bowl with as much as you can eat" suggests a self-service situation where the person can take as much as they want. A buffet is a type of restaurant that typically offers self-service options and allows customers to serve themselves from a selection of dishes. The other options, such as a dishwasher or cupboard, do not make sense in the context of the question.
ocean water | Knowledge: Ocean water is known to contain natural salt due to the various minerals and salts that dissolve into it from the earth's crust and ocean floor. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
incarceration | Knowledge: The act of imprisoning someone is commonly associated with the punishment for committing a crime, especially a serious one like murder. Incarceration refers to the act of being confined to a jail or prison, which is the punishment typically given to those found guilty of murder. The other options do not have any direct connection to the context of the question, and are not associated with the punishment for murder.
partial | Knowledge: The question mentions that the producer requested the removal of a scene with "full nudity" and specifies that this was due to the restrictions of a PG-13 rating. PG-13 movies typically allow for some nudity, but it must be "non-sexual" and "brief," according to the Motion Picture Association of America. The term "partial nudity" is often used to describe the type of nudity that is allowed in a PG-13 movie, which involves brief glimpses of certain body parts but without showing everything. The other answer options do not accurately describe the type of nudity allowed in a PG-13 movie.
frustration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was not successful in winning at chess, which caused him a great deal of emotional distress. The word "failure" also implies that James was not achieving his desired outcome. The word "frustration" accurately describes this feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment. The other options do not accurately describe the emotional experience that James may have had.
sign checks | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the boss has to pay the workers for their job and this usually happens at the end of the week. To pay the workers, the boss would have to sign checks, which is the only option related to paying employees. The other options, such as talking to each other, liking popcorn, disagreeing with each other, and reading a newspaper, do not have any relation to the context of the sentence.
pediatrist's waiting room | Knowledge: The key information in the sentence is that the waiting room has "only some fathers". This implies that it is a waiting room specifically for a type of appointment that would typically involve mothers as well. The most likely option is a pediatrist's waiting room, as this would be a place where fathers might accompany their children for check-ups, but not necessarily their partners. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
natural history museum | Knowledge: The question is asking where you can find a non-living weasel, implying that it is a taxidermied specimen. The options "court room", "cherry tree", "chicken coop", and "zoo" do not typically have taxidermied animals on display, whereas a "natural history museum" often has exhibits of various animals, including taxidermied specimens.
school | Knowledge: The word "students" suggests that the answer will be related to a place where students typically spend a lot of time. The other options, such as "office" and "conference," are not typically associated with student life. "Drawing" may seem like a possible answer since pens are often used for drawing, but the context of the question implies a more everyday use. The word "backpack" might be misleading, as it suggests a physical location, but it is not a place where pens are commonly used. Therefore, "school" is the most likely answer as it is a place where students spend a lot of time and use pens frequently for taking notes, completing assignments, and other tasks.
south america | Knowledge: The question is asking about an area with a high concentration of lizards. South America is known for its wide variety of lizard species and large populations, making it a likely answer choice. The garden, arctic, and New Hampshire are not known for high numbers of lizards, while Utah may have some, it is not typically considered one of the largest areas with lizards.
accord | Knowledge: Accord is often used to describe when two or more people or entities are in agreement. It suggests a mutual understanding or a coming together of ideas. Harmony is also used to describe agreement or balance, but it usually refers to a pleasant combination of different elements rather than a direct agreement between individuals. Problem and text are not related to the concept of agreement, while acceptance suggests a willingness to agree or comply rather than an actual agreement.
surface of earth | Knowledge: Rocks are typically found on the surface of the earth in desert environments, as the arid conditions prevent much vegetation or other layers from covering them up. Oasis, countryside, and mountains may have some rocks, but they are not specifically associated with these geographic features. Bridges are unlikely to have rocks unless they are located near a rocky area.
appreciate more | Knowledge: The word "vapid" suggests that Sarah found the movie to be shallow or lacking substance, despite being entertaining. Therefore, it is possible that she may be more drawn to a book that has more depth and substance, leading her to appreciate it more. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stock market | Knowledge: A fortune typically refers to a large amount of money, which can be earned or found through various means. However, the context of the sentence implies that there is a specific place where one could "find" a fortune, rather than earning it through hard work or other means. Real estate and parks may offer opportunities for financial gain, but they do not guarantee the discovery of a fortune. A treasure chest and imagination are irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The stock market, on the other hand, is a well-known place where large sums of money can be made or lost, making it the most likely answer.
state | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a distinction between a town and a township, and that townships are more common in particular locations. The word "fifty" likely refers to the fifty states of the United States, indicating that the answer choice should be a state. The other options (valley, train station, executive suites) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. While Michigan is a state, there is no indication in the sentence that it is the answer.
skill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that climbing is not something that can be achieved through sheer physical strength or muscles alone. Instead, it requires a certain set of abilities or techniques that are characterized by the word "particular." Skills are often associated with a specialized set of abilities that are necessary to perform a task. The other options, while important in their own way, do not emphasize the need for specialized abilities to climb effectively.
compost pile | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally used the leaves to add them to something that is used for disposing of organic waste. The option "compost pile" is the most logical choice as it is a common method of composting organic material such as leaves. The other options, such as trees or blower, do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
fifties | Knowledge: The phrase "too old for this shit" implies that Jerry feels out of place or uncomfortable with something that may be more common or accepted among younger people. The mention of him being square and not doing drugs or drinking further reinforces this idea. The only choice that correlates with age is "fifties," indicating that Jerry is likely in his 50s and may not be as open to new experiences as he once was. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
admiration | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone who does good to others is likely to have a positive reputation. The word "garners" suggests that this positive quality is earned or acquired through their actions. "Admiration" is a commonly used word to describe a positive reputation or perception of someone, whereas the other options do not have a clear association with reputation or good actions.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercise has a positive effect on stress. Stress can cause negative health effects, such as heart attacks, so that option can be eliminated. The option "busy" does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Exercise is commonly associated with good health, but the sentence specifically asks about the result of exercising when stressed, so that option can also be eliminated. Tiredness may not be the best result for someone looking to relieve stress, leaving relaxation as the most logical option.
moral outrage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the change in the way things are done is not popular with the public. In such a situation, it is likely that people will react with strong emotions like anger and protest, which are commonly associated with moral outrage. Going to court or trial would only happen in specific legal cases, and hurt feelings are unlikely to be the primary reaction to a larger societal change. Confusion is possible but would not necessarily lead to a strong public reaction.
play games | Knowledge: The context suggests that the cards are used for entertainment and leisure, which is commonly associated with games. It is unlikely for a child to do homework with cards, and while they may play with toys or play ball, the context specifically mentions cards. Hearing stories is also not mentioned in the context and does not seem to be a common use for cards.
chimney | Knowledge: Footprints are typically created by people walking on surfaces such as the ground, rugs, or the surface of the earth. However, it is unlikely that anyone would leave footprints inside a chimney as it is not a surface designed for walking and is often inaccessible to humans. Therefore, the correct answer is "chimney", while the other options are more likely to show footprints.
travel to europe | Knowledge: The question refers to someone wanting to see Prague, which is a city located in Europe. Therefore, the correct answer would be to travel to Europe in order to visit Prague. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
smell terrible | Knowledge: Landfills are places where garbage is deposited and left to decompose over time. As a result, the smell of rotting garbage is a common issue for those who live near landfills. While it is possible for some materials to be composted in a landfill, the sentence suggests a negative outcome for the garbage in question. The options "container," "healthy," and "composted" do not make sense in the context of landfills or the decomposition of garbage.
set off | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that starting the car had a specific effect on the attached device. "Set off" is a common phrase used to describe activating a device or triggering a mechanism, which may explain why it is the correct answer in this context. The other options do not make sense in this context or do not have any clear connection to the attached device.
bowl of fruit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny picked a grape out of some sort of receptacle on the table. The options "kitchen" and "painting of fruits" do not fit the context of the sentence. While a fruit basket, a fruit stand, and a bowl of fruit are all possible receptacles for fruit, the sentence specifically mentions that Danny picked a grape out of it, which suggests that the fruit was contained in a bowl with smaller pieces of fruit. Therefore, "bowl of fruit" is the most likely correct answer.
headaches, fall, vomiting, sickness | Knowledge: Too much alcohol consumption can lead to various negative effects, such as headaches, falling due to loss of coordination, vomiting, and general sickness or discomfort. However, it is important to note that hydration can also be an issue when drinking alcohol and can lead to dehydration.
spend money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order for customers to be respected by companies, they need to do something that is beneficial to the company. One action that is mutually beneficial is for customers to spend money, which supports the company's profitability and growth. The other options do not necessarily demonstrate the same level of support for the company's success or may have negative consequences, such as demanding satisfaction without reason or pestering on social media.
shallow | Knowledge: The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that is the antithesis of "deep". "Frivolous," "high," "light," and "funny" do not have an obvious antonymic relationship with "deep." However, "shallow" is a commonly used antonym for deep, particularly when referring to depth or knowledge, which gives us enough context to confidently choose this option.
tree | Knowledge: Snakes are known to climb trees, so it is plausible that they could drop from a tree. Pet shops and cages are places where snakes might be kept, but it is unlikely that a snake would drop from these locations. Fields are open areas that do not provide much opportunity for snakes to climb or drop from, and a tropical forest is a general location that does not provide any specific information about where a snake might drop from.
democracy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the governments of republics typically have a certain form, which can be inferred from the choices given. The term "republic" usually refers to a form of government in which power is held by elected officials rather than a monarch or other hereditary ruler. Of the options given, democracy is the most commonly associated form of government with republics. The other options, such as dictatorship or aristocracy, are generally not associated with republics as they tend to involve the concentration of power in a single individual or group, rather than being distributed among elected representatives.
north carolina | Knowledge: The question specifically mentions barbecue and apples, which suggests that the correct answer must be a region known for its BBQ but not for apple orchards. North Carolina is a famous location for BBQ, with various styles of pork-based barbecue served throughout the state. Although Washington State and Maine are located in the eastern United States, they are not particularly well-known for their BBQ culture. The Great Outdoors and Garden of Eden are not regions or states, so they can be eliminated as options.
wind down | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the clock is still working, but the time is not accurate. "Wind down" suggests that the clock is mechanical and needs to be manually set by turning a knob or key. "Drop" and "stop working" are not actions that would help reset the time, while "continue ticking" and "tell time" are not actions that involve changing the time on the clock.
nightclub | Knowledge: The word "teenagers" suggests that the answer is a place that caters to a younger crowd. The options "mall," "drive in movie," "high school," and "desert" do not seem to fit this criteria, but "nightclub" is commonly known as a place where young adults and teenagers can go to hear music and socialize.
protection | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person worked hard on fencing, which is a sport that involves the use of swords and requires a lot of dexterity. However, the sentence also suggests that the purpose of the fencing was to provide something, which in this case is likely to be protection. Fencing can be used as a form of self-defense or for other protective measures, such as fencing around a property. The option "obesity" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Any of the choices could be correct, depending on the context.  |  | Knowledge: A hurricane is a powerful and destructive storm that can cause a wide range of damaging effects, from high winds and heavy rainfall to storm surges and flooding. Depending on the severity of the storm and its impact on a particular area, it could be described as horrific or catastrophic, bringing about widespread devastation and loss of life. It could also be described as bringing tremendous amounts of rainfall or wind, or as spawning tornadoes in some cases. Therefore, the correct answer would depend on more specific information about the hurricane being referred to, as well as the context of the sentence or question.
dump | Knowledge: Refuse refers to waste or garbage, so it needs to be disposed of properly. The options basement, wastebasket, and garbage can are all places where refuse is temporarily stored before it is taken away for proper disposal. An incinerator is a device that burns waste, but not all places have them. A dump is a site where refuse is permanently buried and managed, making it the correct answer.
catch on fire | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Jane's quick thinking was needed to solve a problem that occurred during her flight, and the fact that she received a medal and promotion suggests that the situation was serious and potentially life-threatening. Catching on fire is a serious situation that would require quick thinking and decisive action from a pilot to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. The other options do not involve such a serious situation, and therefore are unlikely to be the cause of Jane's promotion and medal.
train wreck | Knowledge: The phrase "off the rails" is commonly used to describe a situation where something has gone out of control or has failed. In this context, "flying off the rails" suggests that the situation or person in question is experiencing a sudden and dramatic failure or loss of control, which is most commonly associated with a train derailing or crashing. The other options do not make logical sense in this context.
concrete jungle | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where apple trees are not known to grow, so we can eliminate choices where apple trees are commonly found, such as Washington state and Wisconsin, which both have thriving apple industries. "Front yard" and "countryside" are too vague to know for sure, so we can assume they are possibilities. However, we can be certain that "concrete jungle" refers to a city or urban area, which is not a suitable environment for apple trees to grow. Therefore, the correct answer is "concrete jungle."
go away | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to go home, but his mother is telling him to do the opposite. Out of the given choices, only "go away" accurately represents an action that is contrary to what Billy wants to do. The other options either suggest the same thing as what Billy wants to do (run away, leave, going away) or are not related to the context of the sentence (backspace).
television show | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "Shark tank" and suggests that it is a popular reality show. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being good | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a reputation for causing trouble, but the teacher only needed to keep an eye on him when he was not behaving well. This implies that the person had a habit of good behavior, but also had moments where he acted out. The other options (being crooked, okay, calm) do not make sense in this context.
paragraph | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John did not use any formatting techniques to indicate where one paragraph ended and another began, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The other options do not relate to formatting or written communication.
suffer pain | Knowledge: The question asks what people try to avoid, and suffering pain is a common experience that people try to prevent or alleviate. The other options do not have as much universal applicability - some people may avoid talking to others or believing in god, but these are not universal experiences. Banking money and waiting in line are also not universal experiences, as some people may actively seek out banking services or enjoy waiting in line for certain things.
control events | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person does not believe in fate, which implies that they believe in free will and the ability of people to shape events. Therefore, the most likely answer is "control events." The other options, such as "pray" or "talk to each other," do not necessarily imply a belief in personal agency or control over outcomes. "Dress themselves" and "think creatively" are even more tangentially related to the topic at hand.
being tired | Knowledge: The sentence implies that jogging all day could lead to some negative consequences. While jogging is generally good for improving health and building strength, doing it all day could have negative consequences such as exhaustion and being tired. Heart attacks and shin splints are more likely to occur with an inappropriate level of activity, such as excessive jogging or jogging with improper form. Strong legs may result from jogging regularly, but the sentence specifically mentions jogging all day which could lead to fatigue rather than building strength.
understood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone feels lost, they need someone who will listen and understand them. Being accepted or happy may be helpful, but the main focus is on feeling understood. The option of victory in war is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
bad karma | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of hurting someone else, even if the perpetrator is not caught. "Jail time" is only a consequence if the person is caught and prosecuted. "Sadness" and "depression" may be experienced by the perpetrator, but the question is asking about a more general consequence that is likely to manifest regardless of the individual. "Resentment" could be a possible answer, but it is not a consequence that commonly arises in this scenario. "Bad karma" is a concept drawn from Hinduism and Buddhism that refers to the negative energy or consequences that accrue when someone performs an immoral act, regardless of whether or not it is detected or punished by society. This makes it the most likely answer to the question.
dropping out  | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about graduates who are not attending school later in life, suggesting that they have left school after completing their education. The term "dropping out" commonly refers to leaving school before completing a degree or program, and is the only choice that directly relates to this scenario. The other options (detention, stupidity, overwhelmed, much work) do not provide a logical explanation for why graduates would leave school.
landfill | Knowledge: Tin is not typically considered a valuable or desirable material, so it is often disposed of in landfills or junk yards. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not places where unwanted or discarded items are typically stored.
babies | Knowledge: The word "copulating" suggests sexual activity, which can result in pregnancy and the birth of babies. The word "finally" implies that something was achieved after a prolonged period of time, which is consistent with the idea of pregnancy and childbirth. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
go far | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that flying in an airplane typically involves a significant distance of travel, which is commonly associated with going far. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
kitchen | Knowledge: The sentence is asking where it would be unlikely to find a card catalog, which is a system for organizing information or materials. While a library is a common location for a card catalog, a store, bank or kitchen are not. Therefore, the correct answer is "kitchen" as it is the only option that is not a logical place to have a card catalog. The repetition of "library" in the choices is likely a typo.
fearful | Knowledge: Horror movies are known for their ability to elicit fear and terror in viewers. Watching a horror movie can cause a person to feel scared, anxious, and uneasy, which may result in them being fearful. The other options do not align with the experience of watching a horror movie.
story book | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the adventures of a talking monkey can be found in a particular type of medium, such as a book or story. Out of the options, only the library and story book suggest a place where a child could learn about this type of story. The rain forest and tropical areas are geographic locations and the pet store is unlikely to have books about talking monkeys.
mexican peso | Knowledge: Centavos are a subunit of the Mexican peso currency, where 100 centavos equal one peso. The other options are currencies used in different countries and do not have any connection to centavos or the Mexican peso.
pta | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother is involved in her child's education and is ambitious for a leadership position in a group related to the school. The options "corporation," "whitehouse," and "board room" do not have any clear relation to education or the mother's goals for her child. "Church" could be a possibility, but "pta" is the most likely option since it is a parent-teacher association that is primarily focused on supporting and advocating for children's education.
sporting event | Knowledge: In the context of the question, the word "fan" implies someone who is a spectator of a sport or team. Therefore, the correct answer should be related to a place where people can watch sports. The options "bathroom" and "hot room" are not applicable as they are not related to sports at all. While "football stadium" and "sports stadium" are related to sports, they are too specific and limit the possibilities of what a fan could watch. "Sporting event" is a more general option that encompasses a wide range of sports and events that fans could watch.
paper money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John attempted to pay with something other than paper money, and as a result, Billy did not make change for him despite a prior agreement to do so. The options "unpleasant," "tradition," "stagnation" do not make sense in this context, and "laptop" would not be a typical item used to make a payment. Therefore, "paper money" is the correct answer.
ground | Knowledge: Footprints are typically formed by the pressure of a foot stepping on a surface, which creates an indentation or impression. The options "rug," "roof," and "surface of the moon" are unlikely to have footprints formed in them, as they are not typical walking surfaces. The option "surface of the earth" is too vague, as footprints could potentially be formed on a variety of surfaces on earth, but "ground" specifically refers to the surface level of the earth and is a common walking surface, making it the most likely correct answer.
supermarket | Knowledge: The word "many" suggests that the location where soup can be purchased is a place where a variety of soup options are available. Out of the given choices, only supermarkets typically offer a wide range of soups for purchase. Cupboards and containers are places where soup may be stored, but not necessarily purchased. Gardens and jars are not typically associated with purchasing soup.
binge drinking | Knowledge: The phrase "cash in" suggests that the person has earned a lot of money for working overtime and double shifts. The sentence then goes on to say that he will celebrate and relax with something unhealthy, which rules out options like drinking coffee. "Binge drinking" is a common way for people to celebrate and let loose after a period of hard work, which is supported by the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit with the idea of celebrating and relaxing after working hard.
coffee cup | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that a person has made coffee using hot water and coffee grounds, which is typically consumed in a coffee cup. The other options do not make sense in the context of this sentence as it would be unusual or illogical to pour coffee into a whirlpool bath, a glass filled with a different beverage, or onto the surface of the earth.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eatery is being used as a synonym for another word. Out of the given choices, restaurant is the one that is associated with the act of eating. The other choices are not related to food or dining in any way.
body | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location of illness, which implies that the answer is related to the physical body. Illness can occur in various parts of the body, such as the respiratory, digestive, or cardiovascular system. The other options do not relate to the question or are not anatomical locations where illness typically occurs.
plethora | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the traveler was used to a lack of diversity in the suburbs, implying that they were not accustomed to a wide variety of options. The word "shocked" suggests that they were surprised by the abundance of food options, which is represented by the term "plethora." The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they either do not convey a sense of abundance or do not relate to food.
helicopter | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject being discussed is a flying vehicle that is able to lift straight up. The options "electric motor," "jet engine," "train," and "rotator" do not fit this description. However, a helicopter is a flying vehicle that uses a rotor to generate lift and is known for being loud and moving a lot of air. Therefore, the correct answer is "helicopter."
strong emotion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the artist believed that creating art was not just about creating a mere picture, but about creating something that would provoke a strong emotional response in the viewer. This implies that the artist believed that art should have a deeper meaning than simply being aesthetically pleasing, and that it should convey a message or elicit a response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pay attention | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drive was difficult and challenging, which would require the driver to be alert and focused in order to navigate through the obstacles. The option "listen to radio" and "sleep" suggest a lack of focus and alertness, which would not be helpful in a challenging drive. "Get into vehicle" is not a relevant option as it is assumed that the driver is already in the vehicle. "Hole in one" is not a relevant option as it has no connection to the context of the sentence.
sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was in a desert, which is an arid, dry region that typically does not have many trees or buildings. Therefore, it is unlikely that the birds were on a roof, in a forest, or in a countryside park. The only logical option is that the birds were in the air, specifically the sky, which is where birds typically fly.
adequate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the product received negative feedback from the public, but the expert still found something positive about it. The word "despite" indicates a contrast between the negative reviews and the expert's opinion. Out of the given choices, "adequate" is the most appropriate because it suggests that the product may not have been exceptional, but it was sufficient for the expert's needs. The other options, such as "first rate" or "sufficient," suggest a higher level of excellence that is not supported by the context of the sentence.
tidal waves | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that being on the water after an earthquake could be dangerous, indicating a potential for large waves. Tidal waves, also known as tsunamis, are often caused by earthquakes and can be very destructive when they hit shore. The other options, such as a steam room or crushed ice, do not make sense in this context and are not related to the potential dangers of being on the water after an earthquake.
surf net | Knowledge: The term "millennials" refers to the generation born between 1981 and 1996, who grew up in the era of the internet and technology. The sentence suggests that when they experience boredom, they tend to turn to the internet to entertain themselves, which is reflected in the option "surf net". The other options may also be ways to combat boredom, but they do not align as closely with the behavior of millennials in this context.
ream | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the IT guy needed to replace the paper in the printer. A ream is a common measurement for a bundle of printer paper, typically containing 500 sheets. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
become old | Knowledge: The question is asking about a process that occurs over time, and the most obvious option is the natural aging process. As people age, they experience physical changes that can include wrinkles, gray hair, and loss of mobility. The other options do not make sense in this context - using money, feeling cold, playing games, and believing in god are all potential activities or states of being, but they do not necessarily change over time.
hard work | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the father was dissatisfied with his son's laziness, and that he wanted to encourage some sort of positive change. Among the options presented, hard work is the most directly opposite to laziness, and therefore the most logical answer. The other options could also be desirable traits, but they do not specifically address the son's laziness in the same way that hard work does.
own house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the basement with children playing in it is located in a place that the reader has access to, since it uses the phrase "own house". The other options do not fit this description, as a closet is too small, an office building or church may not have a basement open to the public, and "downstairs" is too vague.
suitcase | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is leaving and needs to pack their belongings. Keeping a shirt in a drawer or on the floor would not be practical for packing. The dresser and closet options are possibilities, but the suitcase is the most logical answer as it's commonly used for packing clothes when traveling.
unhappy | Knowledge: The question asks for the emotion that is furthest away from "unhappy." Therefore, we need to consider the opposite or most opposite emotions of unhappy. Emotions like "glad," "joyful," "happy," and "delighted" are all positive emotions and are therefore likely to be closer to happiness than unhappiness. Therefore, we can deduce that the correct answer is "unhappy," which is clearly the opposite of happiness.
socialize | Knowledge: The verb "socialize" means to interact and spend time with others in a social context. It is commonly used to describe spending time with friends and acquaintances. The other options do not accurately describe spending time with others in a social context. "Tell story" implies a more specific activity of sharing stories, while "go somewhere" could refer to any type of activity. "Wedding" is a specific event, not a general term for spending time with others, and "clean room" is a household chore unrelated to socializing.
great outdoors | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the answer is referring to the natural habitat of a weasel, rather than an artificial or fictional environment. A weasel is a wild animal that is commonly found in outdoor environments such as forests, fields, and wetlands. The other options do not provide a realistic location where you could find a weasel.
communication | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking a phone call will always result in something happening. Given that the options include regret, decisions, food, and car accidents, the most likely option is communication, as that is the most common outcome of a phone call. Regret, decisions, and food are all possible outcomes but are not guaranteed, while car accidents are an unlikely and negative outcome that is unrelated to the context of the sentence.
orgasm and possibly pregnancy or children depending on the context | Knowledge: Good sex can result in a variety of outcomes depending on the individuals involved and their intentions. Orgasm is a commonly desired experience during sexual activity, as it can provide pleasure and release tension. Other potential outcomes include pregnancy or children, which may be intentional or unintentional depending on the use of contraception. The option "doom" is not a likely outcome of good sex, and "venereal disease" suggests a negative outcome that is not necessarily a result of good sex.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that grooming oneself can lead to an increase in self-esteem, which can be linked to feelings of satisfaction. Feeling satisfied with oneself and one's appearance can contribute to a positive self-image and improved overall mental health. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James bought an iPod specifically to listen to music, implying that he would most likely use it in situations where he wants to listen to music, such as during a meeting, at the mall, at a concert, or at work. However, the fact that the iPod is described as 'delicate electronics' implies that it would not be suitable for use in water or other environments where it might be damaged. Therefore, the correct answer is "water."
desktop | Knowledge: The word "computer" usually refers to a desktop computer, which is a device used for work or personal use. A department store, school, space shuttle, or library may have computers available for use, but a job seeker would need their own desktop computer to complete job applications and resumes.
open country | Knowledge: Bald eagles are known to prefer open areas near water, such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines, where they can easily hunt for fish. Open country would provide the eagle with ample space to fly and locate prey. While it's possible for bald eagles to live in other environments such as mountains or pine trees, open country is the most relevant answer based on the bird's habits and preferences. Wildlife refuges and specific locations like Colorado are not necessarily indicative of bald eagle habitats, making them less likely choices.
crash | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's efforts were not able to prevent the computer from stopping working. "Crash" is a common term used to describe when a computer suddenly stops working due to a technical issue, which makes it the most likely answer. "Old equipment" could also be a possibility, but the sentence does not suggest that the computer stopped working due to its age, so it is less likely. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
obesity | Knowledge: The question suggests that eating too much lunch frequently can have negative consequences. Obesity is a known result of overeating and a diet high in calories, which would fit with the idea of eating too much lunch. The other options may also be associated with overeating, but are not specifically related to the question's focus on lunch.
getting information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Susan does not support the KKK's cause, which would make it unlikely that she would be sharing or exchanging ideas with them. Selling hotdogs and falling asleep are also unlikely given the context of attending a meeting. Therefore, the most likely reason for Susan to attend a KKK meeting would be to gather information, either for personal interest or for a journalistic or investigative purpose.
home or cabin | Knowledge: Fireplaces are typically found in indoor spaces where heating is necessary, such as homes or cabins. While a fireplace could technically be found in a desert area, it would be very unlikely as the desert is typically hot and does not require heating sources. The family room or living room are common areas within a home where a fireplace may be found.
sharing information | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker needs help with answering questions, which implies that they require more information or knowledge to do so. The most logical choice from the options is sharing information, which can provide the speaker with additional knowledge or perspectives on the topic at hand. Getting tired, better grade, interesting, and teaching do not seem relevant to the context of the sentence.
lacerations | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was falling into a pile of broken glass, which is a dangerous situation that could potentially cause physical harm. Of the choices given, the term "lacerations" specifically refers to cuts or wounds, which would be a common fear in this scenario. The other options, such as "injury" or "being laughed at," do not specifically relate to the danger of broken glass.
garments | Knowledge: Silk is a luxurious and high-quality fabric that is often used to make high-end clothing items such as dresses, blouses, and suits. Nightgowns may also be made from silk, but the sentence does not provide any context to suggest that this is the correct answer. Mulberry trees are the primary food source for silkworms, which produce silk, but this answer choice is not asking about the raw material used to make silk. Chinatown and bushes have no connection to the context of the sentence.
working | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the slaves were working on a line or in a group, and that even if one died, the others were still forced to continue. This suggests that the slaves were likely doing physical labor, hence the answer is "working." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve physical labor or group work.
less dense than water | Knowledge: Wood is less dense than water because of its cellular and fibrous structure. This means that the amount of matter in a given volume of wood is less than that of an equal volume of water. This property also makes wood buoyant in water, allowing it to float. The other options, such as "good swimmer" or "gilded," are not related to the physical properties of wood in water.
throw things | Knowledge: The word "dodge ball" is commonly associated with a game in which players throw soft balls at each other while trying to avoid being hit. The other options do not make sense in relation to dodge balls. Children may hear music or watch TV as separate activities, but it is not directly related to dodge balls. While playing with toys and playing sports are both plausible options, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on a specific activity that involves throwing objects.
ardor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James had a strong emotional reaction to rock music, which is often associated with passion and intensity. The term "ardor" specifically means strong enthusiasm or passion, making it the most fitting choice out of the options given. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response typically associated with rock music.
plant | Knowledge: Animals are mainly classified into three categories based on their diet - herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Herbivores primarily eat plants, while carnivores mainly feed on other animals. Omnivores eat both plants and animals. Therefore, out of the given options, plant is the most correct answer as it refers to the main food source of herbivores. The other options - human, cuddly pet, specific, and eat cake - are not relevant to the topic of animal diet.
apartment complex | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is moving to a place that is not allowing their small dog, despite being advertised as pet friendly. The options "trailer park" and "grandmother's house" do not fit the context of the sentence. The option "basket" is not a place and seems to be included as a distractor. The option "Germany" may not have any relevance to the context of the sentence, so the correct answer is "apartment complex".
spring forth | Knowledge: A faucet is typically used to dispense either hot or cold water that flows out from a source, such as a pipe or reservoir. The phrase "spring forth" suggests that the water coming out of the faucet is flowing freely and quickly, which is commonly associated with fresh water sources like natural springs. The other choices do not accurately describe the nature of water that comes from a faucet. Room temperature simply refers to the temperature of the water, while wet clothes and take several forms are not related to water sources. Hard water refers to water that has a high mineral content, which would not be an accurate attribute of all water that comes from a faucet.
national emblem | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to a symbolic or representative meaning of the bald eagle for America. The bald eagle is the national bird and serves as the national emblem of the United States, which represents freedom, strength, and majesty. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hollywood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question aimed to become a famous actor or performer, which is commonly associated with moving to Hollywood. Hollywood is known as the center of the film and entertainment industry and attracts many aspiring actors and performers. The other choices, such as the solar system, constellation or night sky, are not relevant to the context and do not provide any clues to the correct answer. Theatre could be a possible choice; however, it does not specify which city or country the theatre is located in, making it an unlikely option.
complete test | Knowledge: The context suggests that the student is in a quiet classroom and has a piece of paper in front of them, indicating that they are likely taking a test. The other options do not fit the context of a quiet classroom or suggest that the student is actively working on something.
entertain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the father was trying to do something to alleviate the child's boredom. The word "goof" implies that he was being silly or playful, which is a common way to entertain young children. The other options - listening to music, playing chess, knitting sweaters, and meeting interesting people - do not seem related to the context of the sentence or the goal of entertaining the child.
pass class | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person was looking at his report card, which typically indicates academic progress. Feeling pride after looking at a report card often indicates that the person has achieved good grades or passed their classes with flying colors. The other options, such as competing against someone or winning a prize, don't make sense in the context of the sentence, while "improve yourself" and "conquer opponent" are too general and could apply to many situations.
own house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific location where people feel most comfortable. "Own house" is the most logical answer because it is a place that people typically associate with safety, privacy, and familiarity. "Dance floor" and "compliments" might make people feel good, but they do not imply the same level of comfort as being in one's own house. "Headache" and "good things in life" are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
train station | Knowledge: The sentence describes John as a bum, which implies that he may not have a permanent home. The sentence also suggests that he lives near a transportation infrastructure, which implies that he may rely on public transport to get around. The stereotype of a bum living near a train station is well-known, as it provides shelter and access to transportation. The other options may not be ideal living locations for someone without a home.
workplace | Knowledge: The word "job" implies that an individual is employed and working in a specific setting. This setting is typically referred to as a workplace, where individuals earn money by performing tasks or providing services. While it is possible to work from home or in a store, these options are not always referred to specifically as a "job." School and park are not commonly associated with paid employment opportunities.
safe deposit box | Knowledge: The question is asking for a safe place to keep jewelry in a hotel room. A safe deposit box is a common option provided by many hotels for guests to store valuable items. A suitcase may be easily accessible to others, a vault is not typically available in a hotel room, and storing jewelry in a department store or hole in the ground is not practical.
furniture store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person needs to obtain a night table in a legal manner. Typically, furniture stores are where people purchase furniture for their homes legally, while hotels and grocery stores do not typically sell furniture. Homes and hallways would not be applicable options for finding a new night table.
attraction | Knowledge: Flirting is often seen as a way of showing romantic interest in someone. Therefore, it makes sense that the most likely reason someone would begin flirting with another person would be because they are attracted to them. Curiosity, confusion, and getting into trouble do not have the same direct connection to flirting as attraction does. Being slapped would likely have the opposite effect and discourage someone from flirting.
save money | Knowledge: Going on vacation usually requires some level of financial preparation. Saving money refers to setting aside funds in advance to cover the cost of the trip. Paying bills and having money may be important as well, but they are not necessarily the first step in vacation planning. Packing and having a reliable car are also important, but they are not as essential as having the necessary funds to pay for the trip.
office supply store | Knowledge: The context suggests that John wants to buy writing supplies, such as a writing instrument and paperclips, which are commonly found in an office supply store. The other options, such as a desk drawer or purse, may contain these items, but they are not specific places where one would typically purchase them. A writer's hand is not a physical location where John can buy these supplies. A stationery store may have a wider selection of writing supplies as well, but an office supply store would still be the most common choice.
neighborhood | Knowledge: Family owned barber shops are often found in residential neighborhoods where they have established a loyal customer base. They are less likely to be found on busy commercial streets, like high streets, because the rent and overhead costs are typically much higher. Canada is a country and not a specific location where a barber shop would be found. Comb and wig stores are specialized shops that are not usually associated with barber shops.
drawer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher was in need of paper clips, which she retrieves from a specific location. The sentence also provides a clue that this location can be opened, eliminating the options of "work," "university," "desktop," and "window." The correct answer, "drawer," is the only option left and is commonly used to store office supplies like paper clips.
closet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the book in question is not needed for a while and should be stored nearby to fabric items you wear. This indicates that the book is likely related to fashion or textiles, and should be stored in a place where such items are also stored. The closet is the most likely option, as this is where people generally store their clothes and other items related to fashion or textiles. The desk, library of congress, classroom, and bookshelf do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
look better | Knowledge: The sentence implies that getting in shape has a positive impact on clothing. One way this may be true is that after losing weight or toning muscles, clothing may fit better and look more flattering. The other options are not directly related to the improvement of clothing after getting in shape.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that rain can make something wet and dangerous, which is commonly associated with streets. When it rains, streets can become slick and slippery, increasing the risk of accidents for drivers and pedestrians. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tool kit | Knowledge: A saw is a tool commonly used for cutting wood or other materials and would likely be found in a tool kit, toolbox, or tool shed where tools are kept. A hardware store may also sell saws, but it is not the most specific or likely option for the question. A bathroom has no clear connection to the context of the question.
knowledge | Knowledge: The question is asking for an association with remembering. Nostalgia and pleasure are generally positive associations that may help with remembering pleasant memories, but they don't necessarily relate to familiarity. Sadness and depression may hinder remembering, particularly if associated with traumatic events. Knowledge, on the other hand, refers to familiarity with a subject or topic, which can aid in remembering details and information related to that subject.
lights | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions the janitor climbing high up in the rafters of the auditorium, which indicates that they were likely working on something located above the stage. The word "replacing" suggests that the janitor was performing maintenance or repair work, and the most likely item that would need to be replaced in this context would be the lights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
table | Knowledge: A dish is something typically used for serving or eating food, and the most common place to eat food is at a table. While dishes can be used for picnics, they are not exclusively used for this purpose, and a sink or kitchen cabinet are not places where dishes are used but rather where they are stored or cleaned. A pantry may also be used to store dishes, but again, it is not a place where they are used.
bad smell | Knowledge: The question is asking about the negative aspect of farting that people dislike. The options 'social ostracism,' 'people laughing at,' and 'loud noise' could be possible negative consequences, but the main thing people dislike about farting is the bad smell it creates. The option 'flower smells' is not relevant to the context of the question and is not a common complaint about farting.
descend | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the counterweight is rising, which creates the potential for the elevator to move in the opposite direction. The word "descend" means to move downward or to lower oneself, which is the opposite of what the counterweight is doing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Park" implies that the elevator is stopping, "reduce" suggests that the elevator is decreasing in size or quantity, "fall" implies that the elevator is dropping suddenly, and "set" does not make sense in this context.
will have to wait | Knowledge: The sentence implies that standing in a queue means you have to wait for your turn, and there is nothing you can do about it. The option "will have to wait" is the only one that is directly related to waiting, while the others are unrelated or even inappropriate. "Become impatient" or "impatience" may be the result of waiting, but they do not describe what you do when standing in a queue. "Spit watermelon seeds at others" and "look around" are irrelevant and inappropriate actions.
jewelry store |  | Knowledge: The question asks where you could get a chain if you don't have one, suggesting that a chain is needed for some purpose. The options "tow truck," "bicycle," and "motorbike" are all modes of transportation and do not typically provide chains. "Chain link fence" is not a place to acquire a chain but rather an object made of chains. A "jewelry store" is the most likely option as they commonly sell a variety of chains for fashion and practical purposes.
food poisoning | Knowledge: The question suggests that eating a hamburger that is not cooked is likely to cause illness. This is because raw or undercooked meat can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli or salmonella that can cause food poisoning. The other options - being full, to fill the stomach, heartburn, and gas - do not relate to the specific cause of illness from eating undercooked meat.
enjoyable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were enjoying the music, which indicates that the music was likely pleasant and enjoyable to listen to. The other options do not necessarily convey a positive or negative connotation, nor do they provide any clear context clues from the sentence.
jeans pocket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object in question is small enough to fit in a pocket, and specifically mentions a man, which implies that it is an item typically associated with masculine clothing. Sunglasses are commonly worn by both men and women, but the option "shirt pocket" may be less likely since it can easily fall out or get lost, and "purse" is typically associated with women's accessories. "Drugstore" and "bag" are not relevant to the context.
train station | Knowledge: Ticket offices that offer different types of tickets, such as for different modes of transportation or events, are commonly found in train stations. Movie theaters and opera houses usually only have one type of ticket office for their respective events. Cities and humans do not have ticket offices as they are not physical locations, and it is unclear what is meant by "different types" in this context.
monitor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is discussing the use of window cleaner on their computer screen, which implies that the correct answer must be something related to computers. The choices "theatre," "movies," "drive-in movie," and "closet" have no clear connection to computers, so the correct answer must be "monitor," which is a piece of computer hardware that displays the images on the screen.
offer to help | Knowledge: The question suggests that your friend needs help with moving, which is a situation where they need physical assistance. Therefore, the best option would be to offer your help. Relying on someone else or writing a letter are not appropriate responses in this situation. Pretending to be busy is dishonest, and promising to help is not necessary as it is implied in the question that your friend needs help and you are available to assist.
barber shop | Knowledge: A comb is a tool commonly used in hair care and styling. While it is possible for individuals to keep a comb in their medicine cabinet, trashcan, suitcase, or pocket, these locations are less likely to be associated with the regular use of a comb. Barber shops, on the other hand, are known for using combs to style and cut hair. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "barber shop".
shelf | Knowledge: Board games are generally stored on shelves when not in use. However, they may also be stored in closets or other storage spaces. The den and the house are not specific enough to indicate where the board game would be stored. The toy store is a retail store where games are purchased, not stored.
teach another | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person had some sort of knowledge or information to share with someone else. Teaching is a natural way to transfer information and help someone else learn. The other options do not relate to sharing knowledge or information, and therefore are not correct.
time | Knowledge: The question is asking what else is needed besides research materials when finding information. The options "internet," "ask questions," "searching for," and "logic" all relate to the process of researching, but only "time" refers to the additional resource needed. Researching for information takes up time which cannot be compensated by the other options.
hat shop | Knowledge: The question asks for a location where a head would not move. In a hat shop, the head is typically a mannequin or a hat stand, which are stationary objects used to display hats. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - a submarine, human body, morgue, and movie theater do not have any clear connection to the concept of a stationary head.
obesity and/or heartburn | Knowledge: Unhealthy lunches are often high in calories, sugar, and fat, which can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of developing conditions like obesity and heartburn. Becoming tired can also be a result of consuming a high-carbohydrate meal or one that is lacking in protein, but it is not necessarily a common outcome of an unhealthy lunch. Spending money may be a consequence of eating out or buying convenience foods, but it is not directly related to the health effects of the meal.
brewery | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "spirits," which refers to alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, gin, and vodka. In order to serve spirits appropriately, a restaurant would likely require a brewery, which is a facility that produces and stores alcoholic beverages. A kitchen cupboard is not adequate for storing and serving alcoholic beverages, and ghosts and a chemistry lab are not related to the production and serving of spirits.
car | Knowledge: The context suggests that the location where bread is being found is unusual or unexpected. Bread is commonly found and consumed during mealtimes such as dinner, and can easily be purchased at a supermarket. It is also stored in the refrigerator or bread box at home. Jail may be a less common location to find bread, but it is still a plausible option for prisoners to receive bread as part of their meals. However, finding bread in a car is not a typical or expected location for it to be stored or consumed.
take a vacation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person injured themselves while working and their coworker suggested they do something to prevent further injury or to recover from the injury. One common suggestion in such a situation is to take a break or a vacation. The other options are not relevant to the context and do not offer a solution to the problem presented in the sentence.
computer store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking to purchase a new computer system. The most likely place to buy a computer in person would be a computer store, as opposed to an online purchase. The other options, such as "place" and "human body," do not make sense in the context of purchasing a new computer system. "Computer science" is not a place to purchase a computer, but rather a field of study related to computing.
new york | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the filming location was recognizable to the audience, which implies that it was a popular or frequently used location. New York is a well-known city for film and television production, and many iconic scenes have been filmed there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
making friends | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man wanted to improve his communication skills before a large event because he was new to the city. It also implies that he wanted to use these skills to connect with people. Making friends is the most logical choice among the options given because it directly relates to the man's desire to communicate effectively and connect with others. The other options may be related to communication, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as making friends.
post office | Knowledge: A post office is a place where people can buy stamps and send mail. The other options do not commonly have mailboxes or sell stamps. A front yard might have a mailbox, but it would not sell stamps. A street corner, school, or apartment complex are also unlikely places to find a mailbox or to buy stamps.
larger family | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the siblings continued to have children with their partners, which would result in an increase in the size of the family. The phrase "reproducing with their husbands and wives" indicates that they were having children within the context of marriage, rather than outside of it, which implies a focus on building a larger family unit. The other options (problems, fun, birth, offspring) do not necessarily follow logically from the sentence.
ore | Knowledge: Smelting is a process of extracting metal from its ore through heating and melting. This implies that the mineral being talked about must be an ore that contains the metal to be extracted. Therefore, the correct answer is ore. The other options are not commonly associated with the extraction of metals.
south | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the use of an air conditioner is more common in a specific area. The option "south" is the most appropriate answer because it is known that temperatures are higher in the southern regions of the United States, where air conditioning is often necessary to keep indoor spaces cool and comfortable. The other options do not provide any contextual clues or logical connections to the sentence.
rainforest | Knowledge: Marmosets are a type of monkey that are typically found in the rainforest. Rainforests provide plenty of trees and vegetation for marmosets to climb and hide in, as well as a diverse range of plant and animal life to forage for food. Other options like wilderness, mountains, swamp, and burrow do not provide the same level of safety and resources for marmosets as the rainforest.
cabinet | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place where a television can be stored and hidden, which suggests that the answer is a piece of furniture or location that can conceal the television. Options like apartment, living room, bedroom, and kitchen are rooms in a house or types of residences, and are not specific enough to answer the question. Cabinet, on the other hand, is a piece of furniture that can be closed to hide the television, making it the correct answer.
laughter | Knowledge: Peek-a-boo is a game commonly played with babies and young children, and it typically involves hiding and then revealing oneself to the child. When the child is surprised by the reveal, they often respond with laughter. Therefore, choosing "laughter" as the answer makes the most sense based on the context of the question and the common reactions of babies during this game. The other options do not accurately reflect the typical response of a baby playing peek-a-boo.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The use of the word "ground" in the sentence suggests that Sam was not on the ground himself, but was communicating with people on the ground through a radio. This is a common procedure for astronauts on a space shuttle, who need to communicate with mission control on the ground. The other options (school, shop, bedroom, train) do not fit the context of the sentence and do not involve the need for radio communication with people on the ground.
The answer cannot be determined as the sentence does not provide enough context to determine where the uncle left.
shaped | Knowledge: The question asks for a method to give ice a desired shape. Out of the given choices, melted and sculptured involve altering the physical state of the ice whereas carved and shaped involve manipulating the ice to create a particular form. Antarctica is not a relevant option as it does not provide any information on how to shape ice. Amongst carved and shaped, shaped is the more general term that can be used to describe techniques like carving or molding that are used to give ice a specific shape. Therefore, shaped is the most appropriate answer.
active | Knowledge: Jumping rope is a physical activity that requires movement and can increase heart rate, making it a good choice for those who want to be more active. Becoming tired and sweating may also be effects of jumping rope, but those are not necessarily the desired outcomes. Being happy and having a sense of rhythm may be personal feelings or experiences associated with jumping rope, but they are not universal outcomes associated with the activity.
carpet | Knowledge: Mold is a common problem in areas that are damp and have poor ventilation. Carpets, especially those in basements or bathrooms, can absorb moisture and provide a breeding ground for mold. Mold can release spores that can cause allergies and other health problems, as well as emit an unpleasant odor. The other options are less likely to be affected by mold and may not contribute to a smelly room.
giggling | Knowledge: Tickling is a sensation that can cause someone to laugh or giggle. The sentence suggests that a person tickling someone else is aware that they are getting close to a very ticklish spot when they hear a certain sound, and that sound is most likely associated with the tickling sensation. Nausea and yelling are not commonly associated with tickling, while itchiness would not produce the sound described in the sentence.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah filled something with peanuts, which is a food item commonly stored in jars. Jars have tight-fitting lids that help to keep the contents fresh, which makes them a popular container for food items like peanuts. The other options (ballpark, box, container, carnival) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cross road | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the store is in sight, which indicates that the person can physically see the store. In order to reach it, the person would need to physically move towards it, which entails crossing a road or some other barrier that separates them from the store. The other options, such as "drink coffee", "dream dreams", or "think critically", do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
thing to do | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trend in question was unusual or strange, but that it had become accepted or popular. The phrase "the new thing to do" typically refers to a trend or activity that has gained popularity or become fashionable. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence, which implies that the trend was once uncommon but is now widely accepted.
discomfort | Knowledge: The word "awakening" suggests that the person was asleep before and suddenly woke up, which can be uncomfortable for some people, especially if they were in a deep or restful sleep. This discomfort may manifest in physical or psychological symptoms such as muscle soreness, headaches or a feeling of grogginess upon waking. While the other options may be possible reactions to waking up in the middle of the night, discomfort is the most likely based on the context of the question.
cute | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a common word that people use to describe puppies. While options like "soft" and "kennel" may be associated with puppies, they do not specifically describe the puppies themselves. "Very cute" also seems redundant with "cute" as an option, and "one choice for pet" is too specific and doesn't match the question. "Cute" is a common descriptor for puppies because of their adorable and playful nature.
garage | Knowledge: The use of the word "stored" suggests that the question is asking about where one can keep an old refrigerator when it is not in use. The option "garage" is the most logical answer because it is a common place for people to store items that are not frequently used. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
have fun | Knowledge: The question asks why young people like to drive a car, suggesting that there is an element of enjoyment or pleasure associated with this activity. The option "have fun" aligns with this idea and is a commonly cited reason for why people enjoy driving. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - cooking food is not related to driving, listening to the radio and concentrating are things that can be done while driving but do not explain why young people specifically enjoy it, and changing gears is a technical aspect of driving but not necessarily a reason why people enjoy it.
memorize | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to remember facts for a test, one must engage in a specific study technique. The option "memorize" directly corresponds to this need, as memorization involves committing information to memory through repetition and recall. The other options - "not forget," "know," "concentrate," and especially "fry up badger fillets" - do not accurately describe a study technique that is likely to help someone remember information.
have legs | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order to run after a ball quickly, you need to have the physical attribute of being able to run fast, which is typically associated with having legs. The other options either do not make sense in the context of running after a ball (e.g. "look first") or are not related to physical ability (e.g. "obese").
relaxation | Knowledge: Listening to someone play the violin can be a relaxing experience because of the soothing and melodic sound produced by the instrument. Violin music is often associated with classical music, which is known for its calming effects on the mind and body. The options "magic," "sadness," and "loud noises" do not describe the typical experience of listening to a violin, while "making music" is a vague option that could apply to any musical instrument.
read book | Knowledge: The sentence implies that parents encourage their kids to do something productive when they experience boredom. Reading a book is often seen as a productive and engaging activity, making it a likely answer choice. Traveling, sleeping, and playing chess may not be practical solutions for a child experiencing boredom, while "falling down" is clearly not a logical or appropriate suggestion.
stumbling | Knowledge: Alcohol affects the central nervous system and can impair a person's balance, coordination, and motor skills. When someone gets drunk, they may struggle to walk in a straight line or maintain their balance, leading to stumbling or swaying. The other options, such as passing out or fever, may also be associated with excessive drinking, but they don't explain why someone wouldn't be able to walk in a line specifically.
It depends on the person, so any of the choices could be correct.
eat fruit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for something that is both sweet and healthy. In this context, the only option that makes sense is "eat fruit," as it is a well-known fact that fruit is a natural source of sweetness and is also considered a healthy food option. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
further knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is seeking truth because he has unanswered questions that are causing him to feel weighed down. Learning would provide him with further knowledge and potentially help him resolve these questions, indicating that "further knowledge" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "lies" or "matters to," do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Free mind" and "work to advantage" are not necessarily inaccurate, but they do not directly relate to James' desire for knowledge.
hotel room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place in question is a temporary sleeping arrangement away from home. The word "kitchenette" implies a small kitchen, which is commonly found in hotel rooms for guests to prepare simple meals. The other options, such as house or apartment, are more permanent living arrangements and wouldn't typically have a kitchenette in the sleeping area. Allen key is a tool and not a place. Dormrooms may have communal kitchens, but not necessarily kitchenettes in the sleeping area.
slowly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hare was overconfident and the tortoise was able to win the race despite moving at a slower pace. The correct answer, "slowly," aligns with this context and is the opposite of "fast," which was used to describe the hare. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
put down | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Joe is doing something with a cup after Bill asked him to do something with it. The phrase "set on the table" suggests that Joe is placing the cup on the surface. "Put down" is the most fitting phrase that describes this action. The other options are not related or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
religiosity | Knowledge: The question is asking for an example of a religious practice, and attending church and praying are commonly associated with religion. Religiosity refers to the degree of devotion or religiousness that an individual exhibits, and attending church and praying are both activities that demonstrate a high level of religiosity. The other options do not have any clear connection to religious practices.
use money | Knowledge: Trading using money is a common practice in modern economies. Money is a medium of exchange that is widely accepted, and it allows people to trade for goods and services without the need for bartering or exchanging other goods or services. The other options do not make sense in the context of trading for goods and services.
school | Knowledge: Schools often have organized lines for activities such as lining up to enter the classroom, lining up for lunch, and lining up for recess. The other options do not have any clear connection to children lining up with other children in an organized manner.
frequent urination | Knowledge: Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it increases urine production and can lead to more frequent urination. Therefore, it is common to go to the bathroom after drinking alcohol in order to relieve the body of excess fluids. The other options may also be associated with drinking alcohol, but they do not provide a physiological explanation for why someone may need to use the bathroom.
satisfaction | Knowledge: Winning a game is typically associated with feeling satisfied and accomplished, as opposed to feelings of disappointment or tiredness. Injuries are not typically a result of winning a game, and competitiveness is more of a mindset than a direct consequence of winning.
learn to fly | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bird is not yet capable of flight, but is in the process of developing this ability because it is still nesting. Therefore, the correct answer is "learn to fly." The other options are not likely to happen soon because they require the bird to have already mastered the art of flying.
bowl | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject of focus is related to Asian restaurants and how food is eaten there. In many Asian countries, it is common to eat food using a bowl and a spoon or chopsticks. The other options are not typically associated with how Asian cuisine is traditionally consumed.
food court | Knowledge: The question is asking about the closest place to eat, suggesting that the options should be related to food. "Serving drinks" is not enough to fulfill the requirement of a place to eat. "Shopping center" is too general and may not necessarily have food options. "Own house" is not a viable option for someone who is not currently at home. "Downtown" may have restaurants but is not specific enough to be considered the closest place to eat. "Food court" is the most appropriate option as it is a designated area specifically for multiple food options.
faces | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was hypnotized by the lips, which implies that they were part of a larger human face. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stay put | Knowledge: The phrase "stay put" is commonly used to describe someone who does not want to move from their current location or situation. It implies a sense of resistance to change or a desire to maintain the status quo. The other options, such as "sit still" and "standing still" do not have the same connotation and do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
playing around | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two people were engaged in a playful activity, which is commonly associated with "playing around." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Making things and constructing imply a more focused and goal-oriented activity, while hug and kiss are not related to wrestling or playing around.
bath tub | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was trying to protect her ring from getting wet while she was in a bath tub. The phrase "get it wet" implies that water may damage the ring, which is a common concern for jewelry. The other options do not provide any context for why the woman would need to remove her ring.
get angry | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer should be an action that is typically associated with a physical altercation or argument. "Get angry" is a common response when people are in a conflict, as emotions are heightened and tempers can flare. The other options do not fit with the context of the question, as "facing each other" and "gather together" could apply to friendly interactions, while "kiss" and "learn from each other" do not typically apply to fights.
air | Knowledge: Insects are known for having the ability to jump long distances through the air using their powerful leg muscles. While some insects may jump through fields or over logs, none of the other options would make sense in this context. Insects cannot jump through solid objects like rocks, and they do not typically jump through bodies of water. Therefore, the correct answer is air.
traffic jams | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cause of a problem is too many people driving, which is commonly associated with traffic congestion or "traffic jams." Transportation and freeway may be related, but they do not explain the result of too many people driving, which is congestion. Traffic accidents are also a problem related to driving, but they are not mentioned in the sentence as a result of too many people driving. Moving is not related to the context of the sentence.
falling in love | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action the individuals referred to happened before their first kiss, which makes options like "embrace" and "asking questions" unlikely. The phrase "at first sight" indicates that they fell in love immediately upon seeing each other, ruling out options like "smile." This leaves us with the correct answer "falling in love."
toy store | Knowledge: The question is asking about where a child can get a wagon, which suggests that it is a toy or plaything. The options "field," "garage," and "backyard" are locations where a wagon might be found, but they are not places where a child could obtain a new one. "Bookstore" is also unlikely as bookstores usually sell books and not toys. "Toy store" is the most appropriate option as it is a place where a child can buy a new wagon.
have moved | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the director's cameras have moved and the extra is now standing in the way of the shot. Asking the extra to step out of or move away from the scene would have been a more obvious choice in this situation, which rules out those options. "Sit down" and "get off" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, "have moved" is the correct answer as it fits with the information provided.
hang up |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the babysitter did something in response to the mother's attempted phone call that was not desirable or expected. The use of the word "panicked" also implies a reaction of fear or anxiety, which may explain why the babysitter hung up the phone rather than answering or responding normally. "Park" and "communicate" do not make sense in this context, and "answer" and "respond" are too generic to fit the specific tone of the sentence.
deadly in wrong hands | Knowledge: This answer is supported by common knowledge and experience. It is widely recognized that guns, when in the wrong hands, can be very dangerous and deadly to others. While the other answers may also be true in some cases, they do not fully explain why guns are not allowed in certain areas.
on planet earth | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location of human residence, which would be on Earth. China and dress shop are specific locations, and train wreck is not relevant to the question. Homes are a possible answer, but "almost all" humans live in homes, so it is not a distinctive enough answer.
It depends on the severity and type of heart problem, but the most serious possibility is death. | Knowledge: Heart problems can range from mild palpitations (an irregular or fast heartbeat) to life-threatening conditions such as heart attack, heart failure, or arrhythmia. In the worst cases, a serious heart problem can lead to death. While perspiration and getting old are not necessarily symptoms of heart problems, they may be associated with certain conditions or lifestyle factors that can increase the risk of heart disease. Therefore, it's important to seek medical attention if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns about your heart health.
accelerate | Knowledge: When a train leaves the station, it typically begins to accelerate, increasing in speed until it reaches its desired velocity. Opening doors is typically done at the station before departing, arriving late would not be a direct result of leaving the station, and decelerating or braking would only occur when the train needs to stop or slow down, which is not the case when leaving the station.
eternal | Knowledge: The word "secular" suggests a focus on the present life and material world, rather than on religious or spiritual beliefs about an afterlife. Therefore, a life that is not acknowledged in the secular world likely refers to a belief in an eternal life or an afterlife that extends beyond this physical existence. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
increase of temperature | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the solution is becoming warmer, which indicates that heat is being added to it. The expected consequence of adding heat to a substance is an increase in temperature. Pleasure, global warming, starting a fire, and feeling comfortable do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not expected consequences of adding heat to a solution.
occasionally | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy eats cheeseburgers, but not always. He eats them more often than some people but less often than others, indicating that he eats cheeseburgers occasionally. The other answer choices all suggest that Billy rarely or never eats cheeseburgers with cheese, which would be contradictory to the information provided in the sentence.
do business | Knowledge: The two conglomerates reached a tentative agreement, which suggests that they are discussing some sort of business deal or partnership. The other options do not make sense in this context- "accomplish" and "make progress" are too general, "stop arguing" does not seem like something that would be a goal of a business negotiation, and "digging holes" is irrelevant.
ground | Knowledge: Dust is commonly found on surfaces that are closer to the ground, such as floors and low-lying furniture. It is less likely to accumulate in higher areas like attics or on windowsills unless they are located near sources that generate a lot of dust (such as a busy street or construction site). While dust can accumulate on carpets, it is less likely to be found underneath them unless the carpet has been in place for a long time without being cleaned. Closets may collect some dust, but they are not as likely to be a primary source.
physical world | Knowledge: The phrase "physical world" refers to the tangible, visible universe that can be directly observed and measured. The question asks what the world is made out of, so the most appropriate answer is the physical substances that make up the Earth, such as rocks, water, and air. The other options, such as fabric stores, ideas, and science labs, do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence and do not provide a plausible explanation for what the world is made of.
let go of | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is afraid of dropping or losing hold of the cup due to their shaking hands. "Letting go of" is the clearest option that matches this context. "Breaking" and "bend over" are not relevant to the sentence, and "careful" and "pick up" do not accurately reflect the fear expressed in the sentence.
popcorn | Knowledge: Movie theaters are known for selling popcorn as a popular snack choice for moviegoers. Popcorn is a crunchy and easy-to-eat snack that can be enjoyed while watching a movie. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
refund | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the payroll tax amount is too high, the IRS will provide some form of compensation. A refund is a common way that the IRS returns excess payments to taxpayers. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a discount implies a reduction in the tax owed, income and spend are not related to tax payments, and a credit would only be applicable if the taxpayer had overpaid in a previous period.
gaining knowledge/inspiration | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the purpose of attending a self-help lecture is to improve oneself in some way. Going to sleep would not be the intended purpose of attending. Gaining happiness could be a possible goal, but it is more likely that attending a self-help lecture would be focused on gaining knowledge and inspiration to improve one's life or situation. Therefore, the correct answer is gaining knowledge/inspiration.
artist | Knowledge: The question is asking for a descriptor of someone who creates art. The word "artist" directly refers to someone who creates art, so it is the correct answer. The other options do not fit the context of the question or provide a descriptor of someone who creates art. "Inspired" may describe the creative process, but it does not describe the person. "Be mean" is irrelevant and negative. "Starve" may relate to the stereotype of starving artists, but does not describe the person themselves. "Imagine" may describe the creative process, but does not describe the person specifically.
stuttering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was trying to say something smooth and impressive, but was struggling to speak clearly. This indicates that they were likely stumbling over their words, which is commonly associated with stuttering or mumbling. The other options, such as being speechless or striking out, do not fit the context of someone trying to come up with a pick-up line and struggling to express themselves verbally.
let down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the emotional reaction of a person when their friends abandon them is being asked for. To be "let down" means to feel disappointed or betrayed, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not relate to the emotional reaction of being abandoned by friends.
bathroom | Knowledge: Plumbing is typically associated with the water supply and waste removal systems in a house, which are most commonly found in the bathroom. This includes pipes for sinks, showers, toilets, and possibly a bathtub. While plumbing may also be present in other areas of the house, such as the kitchen or laundry room, the bathroom is the location where most plumbing is concentrated.
watch again | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taping a television show is done for the purpose of watching it again, which is the same as "re-watching" or "watch again." The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence - "see again" and "reconsider" imply a more critical or evaluative approach, while "enjoyed" and "found interesting" describe a positive reaction to the show, but do not address the act of watching it again.
having sex | Knowledge: The sentence implies that drinking alcohol while being in a couple leads to a specific outcome, which must be understood to select the correct answer. While alcohol can lead to negative outcomes like sickness and disorientation, they are not specific to being in a relationship. Having children and death are not directly related to drinking alcohol while in a couple. However, it is commonly believed that drinking alcohol can lead to increased sexual activity, which explains why having sex is the correct answer.
guard house | Knowledge: A large dog might live in a guard house because guard dogs are often used to protect a property or establishment. Guard houses are small buildings that provide shelter for security personnel and their dogs. The other options do not make sense in the context of where a large dog might live.
loose | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bundle was not tight enough, which caused some contents to fall out. The word "loose" is the opposite of "tight" and is the most logical choice. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not contradict the idea of the bundle not being tight enough.
isolation | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason someone may check up on someone else while they are working is due to a feeling of isolation. When someone is isolated, they may feel lonely or disconnected from others, which can cause them to seek out interaction or reassurance. Schizophrenia and mistrust relate more to a sense of paranoia or distrust, while annoying and executed are not relevant to the given context.
possessing more | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people being referred to have an excessive desire for something. The use of the word "pathological" indicates that this desire may be abnormal or unhealthy. The other options do not accurately reflect this context, as they do not suggest an excessive or unhealthy desire. "Possessing more" is the most closely related option, as it implies a desire to accumulate or acquire more possessions.
excrete | Knowledge: The sentence states that cats mark their territories, which is typically done by excreting urine or spraying a pheromone. The options "eat meat," "have cancer," "cross roads," and "meows" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated as possible answers.
All of the above could be correct depending on the context of the question.  |  | Knowledge: A percussion instrument can be obtained in a variety of places depending on the purpose and the context of the question. If the question is specific to a marching band, then the correct answer would be marching band. If the question is about finding a cheap or used instrument, then pawn shop may be the best answer. If the question is about playing in an orchestra, then orchestra or music store may be the right choice. And if the question is about owning a percussion instrument for personal use, then own home may be the correct answer. It's important to consider the context of the question in order to choose the correct answer.
being late | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that waiting for traffic for a long time might lead to a negative consequence when arriving at work. Among the choices, "being late" is the only option that represents a negative consequence. The other choices ("lengthy," "have time to think," "time-consuming," and "boredom") do not necessarily suggest a negative outcome.
sporting event | Knowledge: Bleachers are commonly found at sporting events and are used as a seating arrangement for spectators to watch the game or match. They are typically made of long rows of benches without any backs and are arranged in tiers for better visibility. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
school yard | Knowledge: The sentence specifies that the soccer field is at a school, which implies that it is likely located within the school's premises or adjacent to it. Among the given choices, only "school yard" fits this description. The other options, such as "countryside" or "park," do not correspond to the context given in the sentence, which is focused on the location of the soccer field.
ride horses | Knowledge: Ranches are typically associated with horses and other farm animals. As such, it is likely that children would enjoy interacting with the horses in some way. While petting the horses is possible, riding them is a more active and exciting activity that is commonly associated with ranches. Playing games and learning together are possible activities that could happen on a ranch, but they are not specifically tied to the context of ranches and horses. Watching TV is unlikely to be something that children would typically do on a ranch.
undivine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny enjoyed the show and used a religious term ("divine") to describe it. Lila disagreed with Danny's assessment, but she did not use the term "bad" to describe it. Instead, she thought the show was "undivine," which could suggest that it did not live up to Danny's religious associations with the word "divine." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to Danny's use of a religious term to describe the show.
misunderstandings | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using the wrong words in a language can lead to misunderstandings, or the misinterpretation of what is being communicated between two or more people. Frustration and headaches may also occur as a result of this, but are not directly connected to the idea of misusing words. Problems and nausea are also not directly relevant to the context of the sentence.
office building | Knowledge: The mention of workers passing through a lobby suggests a professional or business setting, which is commonly associated with office buildings. Opera buildings do not typically have workers passing through lobbies, while hotels often have guests instead of workers. A receptionist is a position within a building, not the building itself. A business plan is a document, not a physical location.
stockpile | Knowledge: The verb "stockpile" means to gather and store a large quantity of something, especially in preparation for a shortage or difficult times. In the context of weapons, it is commonly used to refer to the act of collecting and storing weapons for future use or for security purposes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of gathering weapons.
insignificant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the effort made by the person was not successful and was surpassed by a better solution. Therefore, the result of his effort was insignificant or unimportant in the end. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Innovative" suggests that the solution was groundbreaking or new, which is not indicated in the sentence. "Helpless" and "powerless" imply a lack of agency or ability, which does not match the situation described.
reflection | Knowledge: The word "contemplating" suggests that James is engaging in deep thought and reflection on the research results, rather than simply thinking about them or discovering them for the first time. The other choices do not accurately describe the level of introspection and consideration implied by the word "contemplating."
anxiety and fear | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that applying for a job while currently working can have a negative impact on someone. The option "anxiety and fear" is a common response to the stress of job searching while currently employed, as it can create a sense of uncertainty and pressure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
having sex | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the young attractive people's inhibitions were lowered due to drinking alcohol, which often leads to engaging in risky behaviors such as having sex. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Disorientation, throwing up, and frequent urination may all be potential side effects of excessive alcohol consumption, but they do not necessarily follow from the given sentence. Calling an Uber is not directly related to the behavior of the young attractive people after drinking.
dentist office | Knowledge: A drill is a common tool used in dentistry for procedures such as drilling cavities, removing old fillings, and shaping teeth for crowns. Therefore, it's likely that a drill not being used would be found in a dentist office. The other options are all places where drills would commonly be used, making them unlikely choices. An oil rig would need drills to extract oil, a workshop or repair shop would use drills for various construction and repair tasks, and a tool shed would likely have drills available for use.
bathroom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John urgently needed to use a specific part of the house, and the mention of removing his pants implies that it is a private area. The most likely option is the bathroom, which is where people typically go to take care of their personal hygiene needs. The other choices, such as the living room, yard, and doughnut, do not make sense in this context.
see king | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat in the children's book had completed a quest and was returning to the castle. In this context, it is likely that the cat was returning to the castle to report to the king about the completion of its quest, which would explain why the correct answer is "see king". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
listen | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person has a passion for music, which suggests that they enjoy listening to music. The phrase "all day" suggests that this activity can be done for a prolonged period, so options like "skate" or "relax" don't seem to fit. "Opera" could be a possible answer since it's a type of music, but ultimately, the most fitting answer is "listen," which directly relates to a passion for music.
photosynthesis | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the plants are lacking in some essential nutrient or energy that they require for growth and sustenance. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants generate their own food using light energy from the sun, so it is a logical answer to the question of what they need to do for satiation. Reproduction, not drinking water, and growing tall may be important for the plants' overall health and survival, but they do not directly address the issue of hunger. Bearing fruits and vegetables may be a byproduct of healthy growth, but it is not directly related to the process of satiation.
introduced | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lane introduced James to Sam, leading Sam to think that James was a native. This implies that Lane knew James and had some level of familiarity with him, and that Lane's introduction created the impression for Sam that James was a local. The other choices (guide foreigners, foreigner, established, immigrant) do not fit the context of the sentence, which is discussing how Sam's perception of James was influenced by Lane's actions.
derivative | Knowledge: The sentence implies that much of the art that is being created today is not entirely original. This suggests that many artists are influenced by existing works or styles, leading to derivative pieces that draw heavily from pre-existing art. The other options do not fit with the idea of originality or creativity, and are therefore not appropriate choices.
enjoyable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human enjoys making up questions for the A.I. overlords, so the correct answer should be a synonym for "enjoyable." "Do enjoy" and "enjoy living" both contain similar words, but they don't fit the sentence structure as well as "enjoyable" does. "Eat cake" and "get laid" are completely unrelated and can be eliminated as options.
park | Knowledge: Frisbee is a popular outdoor activity that is typically played in open spaces like parks, beaches or fields. While it is possible to throw a frisbee on a roof or in the air, these are not typical locations for playing the game. A golf course is also an unlikely location for frisbee play, as it is usually reserved for the sport of golf. The option "deadhead's van" does not make sense in the context of the question.
ice cubes | Knowledge: The phrase "on the rocks" is commonly used to request a mixed drink served over ice cubes. This is a way to serve the drink chilled while also diluting it slightly with the melting ice. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, and scotch is a specific type of alcoholic beverage that may or may not be used in mixed drinks.
jar | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about where to put olives if you want to cook them, which suggests that they need to be stored in a container before being cooked. Putting them on a pizza or in an oven are cooking methods, while pressing them for their oil is a completely different process. Refrigerating them may be a step in the process, but it doesn't answer the question of where to put them specifically for cooking purposes. Therefore, the correct answer is jar, as olives are often stored in jars in oil or brine.
northern hemisphere | Knowledge: European red foxes are native to Europe and parts of Asia, which are located in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, it is most likely that a European red fox roaming in the wild would be on the northern hemisphere of the earth. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the location of the fox.
man's hat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item being referred to is made of felt, which is a common material used in the production of hats. Additionally, the specific mention of a "man's hat" narrows down the options to a specific type of hat, as opposed to shoes, tables, or clothes. The option "hat shop" is not an article of apparel or accessory, but rather a location where items such as hats may be purchased.
office supply store | Knowledge: The question implies that the person does not currently possess a marker, so they would need to obtain one from somewhere else. The most likely place to find a marker would be an office supply store, as that is a common location for purchasing writing implements. The other options (desk, pocket, drawer, briefcase) are all possible locations, but they would depend on if the person had already had a marker there, which the question does not suggest.
catching fish | Knowledge: Fishing is a sport or activity that involves trying to catch fish with various types of equipment and techniques. The sentence asks what someone is doing if they are fishing, so the correct answer would be related to the activity of catching fish. The other options do not accurately describe the action of fishing.
military base | Knowledge: The term "civilians" often refers to people who are not part of the military, so the only option where it would make sense to see them standing in a line inside would be a military base. Bus stops, apartments, swimming pools, and water fountains are all unlikely places to find civilians standing in a line indoors.
weather report | Knowledge: The other options do not provide any relevant information about whether there will be a cloud in the sky. "Night or day" and "atmosphere" are too general and broad to provide any specific information about cloud formation. "Car" and "murky liquid" have no connection to the context of the question. The most logical and reliable source of information about weather conditions is a weather report, which can provide specific forecasts for cloud cover.
kitchen | Knowledge: A small house typically has limited space, which means that a dining room or conference room may not be present. Additionally, a furniture store or roof would not typically have a table in the context of a small house. However, the kitchen is a common place to have a table in a small house, as it can serve as both a dining area and a workspace. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be kitchen.
winery | Knowledge: Grapes are typically grown for the purpose of making wine, and the winery is where the grapes are processed and turned into wine. While grapes may end up in other places, such as a fruit stand, field, or garage, the correct answer is the winery because it is the final destination for grapes that are grown for winemaking. The option "painting" does not make sense in this context since grapes cannot physically go into a painting.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy doesn't trust the lighting at certain places, so he takes his desk lamp with him. The options "office," "corner," "shop," and "house" are all locations where Billy may have a more consistent and reliable light source, making them unlikely choices for the correct answer. "Hotel" is the only option that suggests a temporary location that Billy may not be familiar with, and where he may not trust the lighting.
California | Knowledge: The question is asking for the largest state with a coast in the US, so we can eliminate options like "country" and "united states." New York has a coastline, but it is not the largest state with a coast. Florida has a long coastline, but it is not the largest state overall. California, on the other hand, has a coastline that extends over 840 miles, making it the largest state with a coast in the US.
flower garden | Knowledge: Roses are a popular flower for ornamental gardening, and they are commonly planted in flower gardens. While they can handle a range of temperatures, a temperate climate is not necessary for their growth. Botanical gardens and hedgerows may also have roses, but a flower garden is more likely to have a variety of plants that complement the roses. A front lawn may not have the optimal growing conditions for a healthy rosebush.
meadow | Knowledge: Animals are often associated with open spaces and natural environments like meadows, where they can run, play and interact with one another. The other options - fairgrounds, kennel, surface of earth and zoos - are unlikely to be the correct answers as they do not fit the context of the question which suggests a natural environment where animals are free to roam around.
gymnasium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity being described involves playing basketball, which is a sport commonly played in a gymnasium. The use of the word "echoed" suggests a large, open space, such as a gymnasium, where sound can bounce repeatedly off the walls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
classroom | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place where people specifically go to gain knowledge. Out of the choices provided, only a classroom fits this description. Classrooms are typically associated with educational settings where individuals can learn, study, and develop their knowledge of different subjects. The other options do not have any clear association with learning or gaining knowledge.
desert | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the crossroads had no traffic, which suggests that it was located in a more remote area. The option "desert" seems like the most logical choice, as deserts are often sparsely populated and not heavily trafficked. The other options do not fit the description of a deserted crossroads.
grandmother's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children loved visiting a place that had love, candy, and a small dog. This indicates that the place was likely a comfortable and welcoming environment, and the fact that a small dog was mentioned suggests that it may have been a home rather than a communal living space like an apartment complex or trailer park. The mention of "grandmother's" further suggests a familial setting, making "grandmother's house" the most fitting choice among the options given.
advice | Knowledge: The sentence states that Jim gave advice to the homeless person, so the answer must be "advice." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. The fact that Jim is not religious suggests that the advice he offered was likely not related to religion, but this cannot be determined definitively.
table | Knowledge: Cups are commonly used for drinking and are typically kept on a table in a kitchen or dining area. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A closet is for storing clothes and other items, an apartment is a type of housing, a cupholder is a feature in a car, and a restaurant is a place to eat but not necessarily where you keep a cup.
movie | Knowledge: A DVD typically contains a recording of a movie, which is a cinematic production. Concert halls, circuses, and theatres typically offer live performances that are not typically recorded on DVD, although some concerts or theatrical productions may be recorded and sold as DVDs after the fact. Singing is a broad category that could technically apply to any of the other performance types listed, so it is not a helpful clue in this context.
movies  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is buying gum, candy, and popcorn before watching something. The only option that fits with this context is movies, as they are typically associated with purchasing snacks before viewing a film. The other options, such as a water fountain, store or sidewalk, do not fit with the context of purchasing snacks before watching something. The option of hospital does not fit either, as the sentence does not indicate that the person is going to a hospital to watch something.
friendships | Knowledge: The therapist's advice to "get out there and begin socialising" suggests that the person should try to meet and interact with other people. The purpose of this is likely to develop connections with others, which is a primary motivation for forming friendships. The other options do not align with the advice given by the therapist or the context of the sentence.
garage | Knowledge: Car parts are typically stored in a location that is easily accessible and related to the maintenance or repair of vehicles. The garage is a common location for storing car parts as it is often where repairs and maintenance are performed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something happens after someone lives a life, and the most common and expected outcome is death, which is the end of one's life. The other options are either not applicable or incomprehensible in the context of the sentence.
office building | Knowledge: The phrase "workers in suits and ties" suggests a professional environment, and the term "ground floor" implies a larger structure with multiple floors. Of the options provided, only an office building fits this description. A brownstone is typically a small residential building, a highrise building could house a variety of businesses and individuals, a hotel would not necessarily require workers in suits and ties, and a school would most likely not have a ground floor designated for professional workers.
chemistry lab | Knowledge: Hydrogen is a gas that is often used in chemistry labs, where it can be stored in containers for various experiments. While it is also found in the universe and as a component of air, these options do not specifically refer to containers that would hold hydrogen. The ocean and barrel options do not make sense in the context of storing hydrogen.
library | Knowledge: Since Billy is an archaeologist who is interested in ancient human civilization, he is more likely to enjoy finding a library than the other options. A library contains books and manuscripts that may provide valuable information about the culture and history of a particular civilization. The other options such as school, love, adventure, and space shuttle do not necessarily have a connection to archaeology or ancient civilization.
wasting time | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is not engaged in something productive, and rather than focusing on his work or responsibilities, he is watching television. The phrase "much to do" implies that he has responsibilities or tasks that require his attention, but he is choosing to prioritize entertainment over completing them, which suggests he is wasting time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
patience | Knowledge: The sentence implies that getting in line for a long time can be difficult or challenging for a person, indicating that certain traits or characteristics may be needed in order to do so successfully. The option "patience" directly addresses this, suggesting that waiting in line requires a certain level of endurance and ability to tolerate discomfort or frustration. The other options do not directly relate to this idea or provide a convincing explanation for what is needed to wait in line.
leg cramps | Knowledge: Going for a run can sometimes cause physical pain or discomfort, especially if a person is not properly hydrated or has not properly stretched before exercising. Leg cramps are a common issue that can occur during or after a run and can cause significant discomfort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
ante up | Knowledge: The phrase "to join the hand" suggests that the person is getting ready to play poker, and "ante up" is a common phrase used in poker to indicate that someone is putting money into the pot to begin playing. Therefore, the correct answer is "ante up." The other options are not directly related to the act of starting a game of poker.
food | Knowledge: Marmots are herbivores, which means that they primarily eat plants. As a result, they are likely to be good at finding food sources in their environment, such as grasses, herbs, and other vegetation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the characteristics or behavior of marmots.
airplane | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "boarding group" suggests that the sentence is referring to an activity in an airport, which is often associated with airplane travel. The other options - theatre, wedding hall, show, and auditorium - have no clear connection to airplane travel and therefore are not likely to be the correct answer.
corner | Knowledge: The phrase "out of the way spot" suggests that James was looking for a location that is not in the main area or easily visible. A corner is a logical choice for such a location as it is often away from the center of the room and can provide a cozy and intimate setting for a floor lamp. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as an office or desktop would be too visible and next to the bed and at a hotel do not specify a location within a room.
pocket | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a portable writing instrument that a man may want to bring with him. The options of purse and desk drawer are associated with women and stationary locations, respectively, and are therefore unlikely to be correct. A briefcase is a possibility, but not all men carry a briefcase, and the question seems to be asking for the most common answer. A classroom is a location, not a place to put a writing instrument. A pocket, on the other hand, is a common and convenient place for a man to put a writing instrument when he is on-the-go.
books | Knowledge: The sentence describes two bookends on a shelf, which are used to support a line of books. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make sense in relation to the use of bookends on a shelf.
church | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that people were worshiping when the electricity went out, which strongly suggests that they were in a place of worship such as a church. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
breathe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah did not allow proper ventilation for the birds in the jar. Birds need to breathe, so lack of air flow would be harmful or fatal to them. The other options do not make sense in this context - picking berries or reproducing would not be relevant to why the birds died, and the terms "sky" and "roof" do not relate to the situation at all.
dog | Knowledge: The sentence mentions Snoopy and Charlie, who are commonly associated with the comic strip "Peanuts" by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy is a dog, which can help rule out the options cat, house, carpet, and rug. The sentence mentions that Charlie was treating his pet, which also suggests that the correct answer is related to an animal. Therefore, the correct answer must be dog as it is the only option that is related to an animal and fits the context of the sentence.
volunteer | Knowledge: The question asks about building character and padding a resume, which suggests that the answer should be something that is seen as a positive trait or accomplishment. Hanging out and smoking are not productive activities that would typically be included on a resume or seen as character-building. Being stranded on a desert island may be a unique experience, but it is not something that one can actively choose to do. Homework is important for academic success, but it is not necessarily related to building character or padding a resume. On the other hand, volunteering is a common way for teens to gain valuable experiences, develop skills, and demonstrate their commitment to helping others, all of which can enhance their character and impress potential employers or colleges.
live life | Knowledge: The context suggests that the person in question is lacking happiness, which is most commonly associated with a fulfilling and enjoyable life. The choices "fiddle," "sing," "play games," and "run in circles" do not directly address the issue of unhappiness, while "live life" offers a solution that is relevant and logical.
tool box | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was looking for a tool that he needed in order to do some work that required a hammer. The most obvious place to keep a hammer would be in a tool box, which is designed specifically to hold tools. The other options could also contain tools, but they are less likely choices because they are not designed specifically to hold tools like a tool box is.
sitting still | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the young boy was afraid to dance and chose to spend the entire evening in a corner of the auditorium. The phrase "sitting still" suggests that he did not move around or participate in any activities, indicating that he was likely feeling anxious or uncomfortable. The other options, such as "celebrate" and "partner," do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct answers.
do time | Knowledge: The phrase "do time" is a common idiom that refers to serving a criminal sentence in jail or prison. It is likely that a prisoner would have to "do time" if they have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment. The other options may be associated with a person in prison, but they are not as directly related to the concept of serving a sentence as "do time" is.
go to high school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is reaching an age when he is starting high school. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Teach class" would be unlikely for a 15-year-old, "try to get" is unclear, "go to class" is too generic and doesn't convey any particular goal or milestone, and "study book" doesn't make sense as a standalone activity.
enjoyment, euphoria, excitement, laughter | Knowledge: The key phrase in the sentence is "having fun," which suggests that the answer choices are related to positive emotions commonly associated with enjoyable experiences. Enjoyment and euphoria refer to feelings of happiness and pleasure, while excitement can involve a sense of anticipation or thrill. Crying is not typically associated with having fun, and while laughter can be a sign of enjoyment, it is not the only possible reaction to a fun experience.
pack | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when going on vacation, one needs to do something with the things they want to take with them. The most logical option for this would be to pack those items. Paying bills and saving money are unrelated to the context of the sentence. Selling items is not necessary unless one is trying to downsize or make extra money. Having money is also not related to the act of packing.
sky | Knowledge: Meteors are visible from Earth's atmosphere, so the correct answer would be a location that can be observed from our planet. Outerspace and orbit are too far away to see a meteor with the naked eye and an observatory may be useful in tracking and predicting meteor showers, but not necessary to see a single meteor. Universe refers to everything that exists, so it is not a specific location on Earth to observe a meteor.
plamodel | Knowledge: Plamodel (short for "plastic model") refers to kits that allow users to assemble various models, such as vehicles or figures, from plastic pieces. The other options (plasticulture, cookies, cups, and plastisol) are not related to creating something new in the same way that plamodels are. Plasticulture, for example, refers to the application of plastics in agriculture, while cookies, cups, and plastisol are all unrelated to the act of creating something new.
train station or bus depot | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that "many people take public transportation," which suggests that the answer is probably a place where people wait for buses or trains. The options "cricket ground," "surface of earth," or "football stadium" do not fit this description, so the correct answer must be either "train station" or "bus depot".
motel room | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the toilet was likely in a place that is frequently used by people who may not be sober, such as a party or a motel room. The other options do not fit this context, as trains, restaurants, stadiums, and space shuttles are not typically associated with overuse or drunken use of toilets.
Food and/or liquid | Knowledge: Containers are commonly used for storing both food and liquid. The other options, such as garage or pantry, do not typically require a container for storage.
meeting people | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is going to a party of other singles, which likely means that they are looking to socialize and meet new people. The other options, such as racing cars or visiting friends, do not necessarily align with the context of going to a party and meeting new people. Additionally, while drinking alcohol may be a common activity at parties, it is not necessarily the main reason why someone would go to a party of other singles.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individuals were dining out at a place where they could order a meal and also choose a dessert from a selection that was presented to them. A buffet, movies, box, and supermarket are not typically places where this scenario would occur. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "restaurant."
buying | Knowledge: The question suggests that waiting for a sale may be a good idea before making a purchase. The word "buying" is the only choice that directly connects to this idea. The other options are either specific store names or descriptors that do not give any indication of whether or not it is a good idea to wait for a sale before making a purchase.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person is playing basketball through an injury, indicating that they are experiencing pain. The phrase "ignore the pain" is a common expression used when someone is trying to push through discomfort to achieve a goal. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as sweating, cheers, and having fun are not obstacles to playing with an injury, and the knee injury is already mentioned in the sentence.
hunting lodge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the building in question is a rustic or primitive structure with drafting floors. The fact that the friends slept in lofts also implies that the building has a high ceiling. Of the given choices, the most likely option is a hunting lodge, which is typically constructed in a remote area and may have a simple, functional design. The other options do not fit the characteristics defined in the sentence.
overspending | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe's shopping habit was causing him some negative consequences despite having a good job and having extra funds. The word "dangerous" implies that there might be some risky or harmful behavior involved, which could be overspending. The phrase "not enough for his taste" suggests that Joe was looking to spend more money than what he had, indicating that he might be overspending. The other options do not seem to accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
eye contact | Knowledge: Maintaining eye contact is one of the key elements in having successful communication with someone. It shows that you are engaged and paying attention to what they are saying, and can help to build trust and connection between the parties involved. The other options do not contribute to successful communication and may even hinder it. "Being heard" and "conversation" are important, but maintaining eye contact is a specific action that helps achieve these goals. "Not listening" obviously has nothing to do with successful communication.
windows | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that large trucks have the ability to fling rocks on the highway, which can be problematic for other cars. In particular, the rocks can damage or break the windows of cars, which could lead to potential safety hazards. Seat belts and trunks are not likely to be affected by rock flinging, and diesel engines and exhaust pipes are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
planting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after the deer has eaten the rosebush, a person will begin to do something related to plants or gardening. The most logical answer is 'planting', as it directly relates to replacing the rosebush that was eaten. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
control panel | Knowledge: A knob is typically used to adjust settings, such as volume, temperature or brightness. In this case, the question implies that the knob is used for a device that has various settings that need to be adjusted, which fits with a control panel. The other options do not typically use knobs to change settings, for example, opening doors usually require a handle rather than a knob, which is typically used to rotate.
warm room | Knowledge: The question suggests that the sun was affecting the residents inside a room or a house, and the word "warm" is used in the sentence. This indicates that the sun was likely creating a warm temperature inside. The other options, such as dry clothes, tan, or dry ground, do not make sense in the context of the question.
taste sweet | Knowledge: The question is asking about a reason why someone would eat fruit, of which the primary purpose is for taste and enjoyment. While some people may eat fruit for health or nutritional benefits, the choices "monkey," "go off," "keep fresh," and "market" do not offer any reasons why someone would actively choose to eat fruit. Therefore, "taste sweet" is the most logical and supported answer.
mail order or ship goods | Knowledge: The options "mail order" and "ship goods" are both commonly used methods to get products to customers. "Carrier pigeon" is not a viable option for most companies, as it is not a reliable or efficient method of delivery. "Own factory" is also not necessarily a method of delivery, as it refers to where the products are manufactured, not how they are delivered to customers. "Commit crime" is obviously not a legitimate option for any company.
thorough | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John missed the real cause of death because he only gave a perfunctory examination. This implies that if he had done a more thorough examination, he may have found the real cause of death. Therefore, the correct answer is "thorough." The other options don't necessarily imply a more in-depth examination, and therefore are not as relevant to the context of the sentence.
stretchable | Knowledge: When you drink a lot of water, your bladder is able to stretch and hold more liquid than when it is empty. This is because the bladder's walls are made of smooth muscle tissue that can expand and contract to accommodate the amount of fluid inside. The other options do not accurately describe what happens to the bladder when it fills with liquid.
the mail to be delivered | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James dislikes communicating through mail because he doesn't like waiting for something. The other options don't really fit the context - "response" could be a possibility, but it doesn't convey the idea of waiting. "Learning" and "exchanging ideas" don't make sense in the context of waiting, and "confusion" doesn't relate to the issue of not liking communication via mail. Therefore, the correct answer is "the mail to be delivered."
bankruptcy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a barrier to buying products, which is difficult or impossible to overcome if you experience a certain condition. The word "bankruptcy" means a lack of financial resources, which would certainly prevent someone from buying products. The other options do not have any clear connection to a lack of resources.
shopping bags | Knowledge: The sentence is asking how to carry groceries, suggesting that the items are likely purchased from a grocery store. Shopping bags are a common way to transport groceries, and the other options do not make sense in this context. Restaurants are not relevant to the scenario, two wheels could refer to a bike but the sentence does not suggest this, vegetable soup is unrelated, and exhaust pipe is not a practical way to carry groceries.
community | Knowledge: The phrase "public recreational areas" typically refers to shared outdoor spaces where people can participate in leisure activities together. This suggests that the purpose of these areas is to create a sense of community within the condominium complex, where residents can interact and engage in shared experiences. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
utah | Knowledge: The question is asking for a state that still has wild bald eagles. Canada is not a state, but a country. Cliff and mountains are not states either, but geographic features that could be habitats for bald eagles. Captivity would not be a correct answer since the question is asking for wild bald eagles. Utah is the correct answer as it is one of the few states in the US where bald eagles still exist in the wild.
party | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about what needs to be cleaned up after a party, which may include things like empty cups, plates, and general debris. The other options, such as a son's room or a dishwasher, do not necessarily have any connection to the context of the question. The dish washer option is too similar to the dishwasher option to be a separate, distinct choice. The dining room could be associated with a party, but it does not represent the general cleanup that would be required after a party.
entertainment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lilly enjoys watching films as a way to relax before going to sleep. The other options (falling asleep, fatigue, crying, fall asleep) are related to the physical or emotional effects of watching films, whereas entertainment is the only option that refers to the enjoyment or pleasure that Lilly derives from them.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel was housed in a location that was accessible to the children, as they were able to come visit it. The only option that fits this context is classroom, which is a common location for pets in educational settings. The other options do not make sense in this context.
food consumed | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a requirement that is necessary for an organism to continue living. Out of the options given, only "food consumed" directly relates to the basic biological need for nutrients and energy to sustain life processes. While reproducing is necessary for the continuation of a species, it doesn't necessarily apply to an individual organism's survival. "Eventually die" and "growing older" are not requirements, but rather eventualities that occur during the course of life. "Money" is not a biological requirement for living organisms.
tickle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children were engaging in a playful activity that involved causing each other to laugh. Tickle is a common way to do this among children. Play ball, reading a book, jump rope, and see exhibits do not typically involve causing laughter between children.
hospital | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the needle is being looked for in a place where it is commonly found, and the options present a list of places where needles are likely to be found. A haystack is a common expression used to describe the difficulty of finding something small and sharp like a needle, so it is an unlikely place to find one. A spool of thread is also a likely place to find a needle since they are often used together in sewing. A box of needles and a doctor's office are both places where needles are commonly stored and used, so they are also unlikely places to find a needle. However, a hospital does not typically keep needles lying around, but rather uses them in a controlled and sterile environment, making it the least likely place to find a needle.
rain water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something falls out of the sky and is generally well received, implying that it is something beneficial. Rain water is commonly associated with being beneficial and well received as it nourishes plants and replenishes water sources. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
football stadium | Knowledge: The description of a location where you would sit in bleachers and watch large men run strongly implies a sporting event, and specifically one where men are running around on a field. The term "bleachers" specifically refers to a type of seating often found at sporting events like baseball, basketball, and football games, but the description of large men running suggests that it is likely a football game, where players are often larger and more physically imposing than in other sports. The other options (pharmacy, concert, soccer game) do not fit the description provided.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John took his appointment book with him to the checkup but could not find it anywhere. Later, he found it after buying a new one, going home, and taking a shower. The fact that he found it after taking a shower implies that it was on his person while he was at the checkup. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he looked for the appointment book but couldn't find it, which suggests that it was not in his handbag, wallet, or any other place where he would normally keep it. Therefore, the most likely option is that the appointment book was in his pocket, which he discovered after taking off his clothes for the shower.
back alley | Knowledge: A city cat is a domestic cat that lives in an urban environment. They are often seen wandering around back alleys in search of food or shelter. Compost piles and garbage cans may attract stray cats, but it is unlikely that they would be a regular habitat for a city cat. The milky way galaxy is not a location where a cat can physically live. While a backyard may be a part of a city cat's territory, it is not specific enough to be the correct answer for this question.
shaker | Knowledge: The question relates to the common practice of keeping salt in a container called a shaker, which is designed for easy dispensing. The other options are not relevant to the context of mealtime and the practice of seasoning food.
There is not enough information in the sentence to determine the correct answer.
painful | Knowledge: Research suggests that many girls experience some pain or discomfort during their first sexual experience due to the stretching of the hymen or vaginal opening. While some girls may experience pleasure or no pain at all, the options "pleasant," "irritating," "effect of burning calories," and "dirty" do not accurately reflect the common experiences or feelings associated with the first time having sex for a girl.
England | Knowledge: The sentence provides three distinct clues about the location John is booking a flight to: it is known for being foggy, residents enjoy tea, and it is ruled by a Queen. These three characteristics are all associated with England, a country known for its frequent fog, traditional tea culture, and a constitutional monarchy under Queen Elizabeth II. The other options have no connection to the clues provided in the sentence.
chair | Knowledge: The question is asking for an alternative furniture item that can be used for relaxation in a bedroom. While some of the other choices, such as a sofa or couch, could be used for relaxation, they may not fit in a typical bedroom due to space constraints. A chair is a more likely option as it can be small and comfortable, and is often found in bedrooms for reading or relaxing. Footbed is not a common piece of furniture for relaxing, and furniture is too broad of a category to provide a specific answer.
fairy tale | Knowledge: The phrase "handsome prince" is a common trope in fairy tales, where the prince often serves as the romantic hero who rescues the damsel in distress. While there may be princes in real-life courts and castles, the use of the term "handsome prince" suggests a fictional portrayal rather than a historical or factual one. The option "fairy tale" is the most specific and relevant to the context.
away from | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the child was forcefully taken from its parents, which suggests that the correct answer would relate to the direction in which the child was taken. "Away from" is the only option that indicates a direction, while the other options do not provide any clear indication of direction or context.
supermarket | Knowledge: The word "sale" suggests that milk is being sold, which would typically occur in a store or shop. The option "supermarket" is a common place where milk is sold, whereas the other options do not make sense in the context of milk being sold. The options "opera", "apartment", "train station", "the refrigerator", and "kitchen" do not typically involve the sale of milk.
floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy placed chairs somewhere, which implies a physical space. The most likely place for chairs to be set up is on a floor, which is a common surface for furniture. The other options, such as conference or theater, describe larger spaces or events and do not specify a surface. Building and online are even more vague options that do not relate to the physical placement of chairs.
become adult | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something significant happens to a child when they reach their late teens, indicating a milestone in their life. The commonly accepted idea is that a child becomes a legal adult at 18 years old, marking the end of their childhood and the beginning of their adult life. The other options such as cleaning their room or reading a book may be tasks associated with being a responsible adult, but they do not represent a significant life change. Getting married is also a common milestone for adults, but not all children get married in their late teens.
bored | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the father is encouraging the kids to play games because he doesn't like seeing them sitting around and looking bored. Therefore, the correct answer is "bored." The other choices are possible reasons why the father may have told the kids to play games, but they do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
create | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam feels like he has destructive abilities, which may lead one to assume that he does not feel confident in his creative abilities. Therefore, when he discovers that he is capable of creating something, he is surprised. The other choices do not align with the context of the sentence, as they imply that Sam is capable of fixing or building something, which is not implied in the sentence.
illness | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the person feels like they are getting a cold, which indicates that they are not feeling well. Therefore, the correct answer is illness. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not fit the information given.
pantry | Knowledge: The sentence refers to storing canned goods behind a type of door, suggesting that it is a closed storage area, such as a pantry, where goods are commonly kept. The other options, such as a cabinet, cupboard, or even supermarket, do not necessarily imply that canned goods would be specifically stored there.
pull muscle | Knowledge: The word "not" in the question suggests that we need to find an option that is not a reason to go for a run. Pulling a muscle is a negative outcome that can occur during a run and is not a reason to go for a run. The other options suggest positive outcomes such as improved health, weight loss, and increased fitness, which are common reasons people choose to go for a run.
neighborhood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bungalows are located in a small area, implying a sense of community. The terminology "group" further supports the idea of a collection of homes in close proximity to each other. The word "neighborhood" specifically refers to a small, defined area that is inhabited by a community of people living in proximity to one another. The other options, such as "park," "woods," and "suburbs," do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bed" is not an appropriate term to describe a group of bungalows.
ballpark  | Knowledge: The phrase "peanuts or Cracker Jacks" is often associated with a baseball game, as it is a common snack sold at concession stands. The fact that the person in the sentence couldn't have these snacks because of allergies suggests that they were at a baseball game, which makes the correct answer "ballpark." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
asia | Knowledge: Continents are large landmasses that are typically divided based on geology, geography, and culture. Asia is one of the seven continents on Earth, which includes Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Islands, oceans, and Australia are not continents, but they are geographical features that can be found on or around them.
peace  | Knowledge: Paintings of pastoral scenes often depict serene landscapes with picturesque settings, conveying a sense of peace or tranquility. This type of artwork generally portrays nature in its unspoiled form, and viewers may experience a sense of relaxation or calmness when viewing these artworks. The other options such as seeing artifacts, joy, wonder, and shock do not fit with the context of the question which is about a specific emotion that may be elicited by viewing pastoral scenes.
human body | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the organ being referred to is part of the human body and cannot be played in the traditional sense. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a system or a music store may contain organs that can be played, while a cathedral or a band hall may have instruments called organs that can be played, but they are not part of the human body.
high school or college  | Knowledge: The sentence states that James is a senior, which typically refers to a student in their final year of high school or college. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The typo in the second option, where "talking" should be "taking," does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
underground | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the typical location of buildings (overground) and something else. The options "tall," "huge," "small," and "overground" are all related to size or height, which is not the opposite of being located overground. The opposite of being overground is being underground, which is the correct answer.
courtroom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the situation being described is related to a legal accusation or trial. One person having a briefcase may indicate that they are a lawyer or someone involved in the legal system. The option "to help" does not make sense in this context, and the options "hand" and "desk" do not relate to a legal accusation. The option "airport" could potentially be relevant if the accusation occurred in an airport, but there is no clear indication of this in the sentence.
purchasing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was actively filling up their cart, which suggests that they were likely purchasing items rather than just browsing. The option "debt" implies a negative context and is not supported by the sentence. "Giving up" and "meeting friends" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Compare prices" may be a possible choice, but it is not clear if the person was actively comparing prices or just making purchases.
preposition | Knowledge: The question is asking for the type of word used as a preposition to someone. The other answer choices are not types of words that function as prepositions in a sentence. A pronoun is a type of word used to replace a noun, while an adjective describes a noun. Position refers to a physical location or placement, while an interjection is a word used to express emotions or feelings. A conjunction is a word used to join clauses or sentences together. Therefore, the correct answer is preposition, as it is the type of word used to indicate the relationship between someone and another element in the sentence.
feelings | Knowledge: The sentence implies that playing violin can evoke strong emotions in a person, which is a common experience shared by many musicians. The act of creating music is often seen as an emotional outlet, where the musician can express their feelings through their instrument. The other options, such as sadness or hunger, are not necessarily associated with playing music and do not fit the context of the sentence.
well | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual was using a bucket to retrieve something, but it was empty. The most likely scenario is that they were attempting to retrieve water from a well, which can often dry up. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mansion | Knowledge: The term "palatial estate" suggests that the property in question was a grand and luxurious residence, typically denoting a mansion or a large and opulent house. The drawing room, being a central feature of such a property, would most likely be located within the main building, which would be the mansion or large house. The other options such as artist's house or bordello do not fit the context of a grand and opulent estate. The term "studio" could potentially fit if the property belonged to an artist, but without more information, it is less likely than "mansion" or "large house."
warehouse | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man worked in a place where large containers are unloaded from delivery trucks, which is a common practice in warehouses. The fact that the containers always had food in them could be a hint that the man worked in a food-related warehouse, such as a distribution center for a grocery store or a warehouse for a food production company. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence as they do not involve large containers being unloaded from delivery trucks.
feel proud | Knowledge: The sentence implies that achieving something is a positive experience, which is often associated with a sense of pride or accomplishment. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this context.
eat food | Knowledge: The question is asking for what always happens during lunch, and the most common and expected action during a meal is to eat food. The other options may happen during lunch, but they are not guaranteed or universally experienced by everyone during a meal, unlike the act of eating food.
movies | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that studios spend a lot of money on something, and the only option that is related to the film industry is "movies." Studios typically invest a significant amount of money in making movies, including hiring talent, renting equipment, creating sets and special effects, and marketing the finished product. None of the other options have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lawyer  | Knowledge: When going through a divorce or separation, a lawyer is often necessary to help navigate the legal process and ensure that each party's rights are protected. While friends may provide emotional support, civil authorities and judges may be involved in the process, but they are not typically sought out as a direct source of assistance. "Trouble" is not a viable option as it does not make sense in the context of the question.
regret | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim's reason for not wanting to talk on the phone with his family is because it brings up painful feelings for him. The word "painful" implies that the feelings are negative and not something he wants to experience. The choice "regret" is the most likely because it suggests that Jim may have made choices or decisions in the past that he now regrets, and therefore wants to avoid interacting with his family. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence.
buy things | Knowledge: The question is asking for the reason why people spend money, and the answer that best fits the context is "buy things." People spend money in order to purchase goods and services that they need or want. "Spend cash" and "go shopping" are both ways of spending money, but they do not fully answer the question of why people do so. "Have job" and "make money" are factors that may enable people to spend money, but they do not address the direct reason for spending it.
front door | Knowledge: The sentence implies that leaving through a window is a possible option, but it is not the only way to leave a home. The front door is the most common and expected way to exit a home, which makes it the correct answer. The other options (office, wall, and building) are not relevant to the context of leaving a home. Additionally, "wall" is repeated twice in the choices, suggesting that it was an error in the options.
waiting | Knowledge: The word "queue" typically refers to a line or sequence of people waiting for something, so the most logical answer would be "waiting". The other options may be relevant to someone in a queue, but do not directly describe what happens when standing in a queue.
Seattle | Knowledge: Seattle is well known for its rainy weather, often being jokingly referred to as the "rainy city". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
movie theatre | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a film and discomfort, which suggests that the clientele were at a place where movies are shown. The option "movie theatre" is the only choice that fits this context, as the other options do not have any clear connection to films or air conditioning.
machines | Knowledge: Ball bearings are commonly used in machinery and mechanical applications to reduce friction and allow for efficient movement or rotation. The other options (support axial loads, can, allow movement, church) do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence or the use of ball bearings.
great joy | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the guy was successful in cashing in his check, which implies that he received some form of payment or reward. It is likely that he would feel a sense of relief or happiness after being able to cash in the check. The option "extra money" also suggests a positive outcome, but it does not describe the guy's emotional state. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
liked by | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific action that can be taken to please parents with regards to a house. The option "buy" may seem like a possibility, but it is vague and doesn't specify what needs to be bought. "Graffiti it" is clearly not a desirable action for a house. "Respect" and "success" are vague and don't provide any information on what needs to be done. "Liked by" is the best option as it suggests that parents will be pleased if they like the house, which could be achieved through various means such as appealing design, good maintenance, or a desirable location.
aggravation  | Knowledge: The question suggests that reading newspapers nowadays has a negative effect on the reader, leading to a feeling of aggravation. This could be due to the prevalence of negative news stories and sensationalized headlines commonly found in modern newspapers. The other options are not related to the context of the question and do not provide any insight into the intended answer.
fish market | Knowledge: Crab is a type of seafood commonly sold at fish markets. Hotels and markets may sell seafood, but it's not clear if they specialize in crab specifically. Chesapeake Bay is a specific location known for its seafood, but it's not a type of establishment. Tidepools and beach sand are not places where one would typically go to buy crab.
spread wings | Knowledge: The verb "scoop up" suggests that the bird is trying to gather or collect something. In this case, the bird is trying to gather more air. Since birds use their wings to fly and to manipulate air currents, it makes sense that spreading their wings would be the action they would take to scoop up more air. The other options, such as laying eggs, heading south, or squawking, do not relate to air scooping.
living room | Knowledge: The question indicates that the excess ottoman needs a place to go, so it is likely that it is currently taking up space in a room where it is not needed. Out of the choices given, a living room is the most logical place for extra furniture. A furniture store is where one would go to buy furniture, not to place it, and a basement or parlor may not be suitable areas for furniture that is intended for regular use. The option "turkey" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
unhappy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person received help from his father and feels glad about it. The opposite of feeling glad in this context would be feeling unhappy. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Regretful would suggest that the person had made a mistake, which is not implied in the sentence. Hatred is too extreme a reaction to not receiving help. Downcast and disappointed both suggest a degree of sadness, but don't work as opposites to feeling glad.
wait in line | Knowledge: When shopping at a store, it is common for customers to wait in a line until it is their turn to make a purchase. This is a standard practice in most stores as it helps to maintain order and ensures that customers are served fairly. The other options do not relate to the act of purchasing something at a store.
die | Knowledge: The phrase "green thumb" is commonly used to describe someone who is skilled at gardening and can make plants thrive. The sentence states that the person in question did not have this skill and every time she tried to make something grow, it would die. Therefore, the correct answer is "die." The other options, such as growth, flowering, ground, and plants, might seem like plausible choices, but they do not fit with the context of the sentence.
social life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person who is going out often and talking to a lot of people has a certain type of lifestyle or behavior. The term "social" relates to interactions between people, and a person who has an active social life would be engaging in activities and interactions with others frequently. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as well as "social life."
spring into action | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person took action to achieve their dreams, as opposed to accepting their fate or feeling upset. "Spring into action" means to take quick and decisive action, which fits with the idea that the person was proactive in pursuing their goals. The other options do not align with the idea of taking action towards a goal.
high school | Knowledge: The age of the player suggests that he is likely playing on a high school football team, as this is the age range typically associated with high school athletics. It is also common for high schools to have their own football fields for home games. The other options, such as college campus, Oklahoma, park, or school campus, do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
college campus | Knowledge: Fraternities are typically associated with college campuses, so it would make sense for the gymnasium they prefer to work out at to also be located on a college campus. The other options (spa, high school, school or YMCA, stadium) don't fit the context of the sentence as well.
with sour cream and cheese | Knowledge: The other options do not make sense as a way to eat a potato. Restaurants might offer potato dishes, but they do not describe a specific way to eat a potato. Vegetable soup might contain potatoes, but it is not a way to eat a potato on its own. Exhaust pipes and shopping bags are not related to eating potatoes. With sour cream and cheese is a popular way to eat potatoes, especially baked potatoes, and is a commonly recognized option.
ticket booth | Knowledge: Buying a ticket in person typically involves physically going to a location where tickets are sold, which in the case of trains is usually a ticket booth. A train depot may also have a ticket booth, but not necessarily. "Purse" and "manual" are not relevant to the context of buying train tickets. A conductor's hand would only be used to collect a ticket that has already been purchased.
calm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after experiencing shock, the person settled down and felt a certain way. The word "calm" is often associated with feeling relaxed or at ease, which makes sense in the context of someone settling down after experiencing shock. The other options either contradict or do not fit the context of the sentence.
coffeepot | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a container holding hot liquid broke when it hit the ground. Choosing "coffeepot" as the correct answer is supported by the fact that coffeepots are commonly used to hold hot liquids and have plastic handles that can break if dropped. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
biology laboratory | Knowledge: Fungi are often studied in biology labs, as they are important organisms to understand in the context of ecology, genetics, and disease. While fungi can certainly be found in caves and on decaying matter, the reference to a university suggests that the context is academic in nature. Mushroom hunting and old cheese are less likely to be associated with a university setting.
have talent | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order to go on stage after an audition, one must possess a certain quality or skill. The phrase "have talent" is commonly associated with performing on stage, as it suggests that the person has a natural ability or skill in acting or some other talent that is useful for stage performances. The other options do not necessarily apply to performing on stage or do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hop garden | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker believes a garden would be more valuable than gasoline, and specifically mentions a hop garden as a possible example. This may indicate that the speaker is interested in gardening or horticulture, and believes that growing hops would be a valuable use of land. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
build | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after years of work, something was finally brought to fruition, which means it was completed or accomplished. Out of the choices given, "build" is the only option that makes sense in this context. "Laugh" and "anxiety" do not fit the tone of the sentence, and "excitement" and "celebrate" don't directly relate to the idea becoming a reality.
gilded | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that wood is covered thinly with gold metal, which is a process known as gilding. Gilding is a common decorative technique in which a thin layer of gold or gold-colored metal is applied to a surface. The other options do not accurately describe the process of gilding, as they do not relate to the use of gold or the thinness of the layer applied.
war | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the loss of soldiers' lives, which is a common occurrence during a war. The word "general" also suggests that there was a military operation, and apologizing for confusion is a common response when things go wrong in a war. The other options, such as Germany, class, quandry, or opera, do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
sporting event | Knowledge: Local fans are likely to showcase an athlete at a sporting event, such as a game or competition, where the athlete can demonstrate their skills in real-time. Museums and locker rooms are not typically places where athletes are showcased, and while the Olympics is a major sporting event, it is not specific to a local fanbase. A stadium is a possible option, but it is still most commonly used as a venue for sporting events.
join | Knowledge: The opposite of dissociate is to join or connect with someone or something. Dissociate refers to the act of disconnecting or separating, so the opposite would be to bring together or unite. Fuse, unit, combine, and incorporate can also be synonyms for join, but in this context, join is the best answer as it is the most commonly used opposite of dissociate.
shoes and socks | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common item that people wear on their feet, which would be shoes and socks. Floors, tables, surfaces, and desks are not typically associated with being worn on one's feet, making those options unlikely choices.
South Carolina | Knowledge: Columbia is the capital city of South Carolina, which means that this state is the most likely answer. While other states may have a city with the same name, the context of the question suggests that the question specifically pertains to the capital city of a state. Therefore, options such as Wyoming, Tennessee, and Missouri can be eliminated because they do not have a city called Columbia that serves as a state capital. Similarly, Washington DC is not a state, so it cannot be the correct answer.
relax | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the woman wanted to do something calming and soothing at the end of the day, which is often associated with relaxing activities. Putting on soft music is a common way to create a calming atmosphere, and the other options do not fit in with the context. Dance and skate are both physical activities that are unlikely to help you relax, while opera is not typically associated with creating a relaxing environment. Therefore, the correct answer is relax.
battlefield | Knowledge: The question is asking about where medics practice their craft when they are helping soldiers in the middle of fighting. This suggests that the location would be somewhere near or on the battlefield. The other options, such as a funeral, hospital, or safety tent, do not make sense in the context of the question.
All of the choices could potentially be correct, as someone could learn about a piccolo in any of these settings. However, some choices may be more likely than others depending on the context. For example, if the question is asking where a beginner might learn about a piccolo, the answer may be music class or a music instructor. If the question is asking where an experienced musician might play a piccolo, the answer may be orchestra or wind ensemble. The bandroom could apply to both situations.
direct traffic | Knowledge: If power is out, traffic lights may not be functioning, which can cause traffic congestion and potential accidents. Police officers are trained to direct traffic in such situations to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The other answer choices are not relevant to the context of the question.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the artist is satisfied with their work, which usually results in a feeling of relaxation and contentment. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional state associated with completing a satisfactory work of art. Enlightenment and controversy are typically associated with more profound responses to creative work, while tiredness and frustration usually result from difficulties encountered during the creative process.
air | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the frisbee is currently in motion and being used in a game. Therefore, it is most likely to be in the air during play. The other options, such as outside or park, do not provide information about the location of the frisbee within the game. Roof and tree are unlikely options as they are not typically part of a frisbee game.
canon | Knowledge: A "ball projectile" typically refers to a type of ammunition fired from a cannon, which is a large gun designed to launch heavy projectiles over long distances. The other options, such as a machine or a weapon, may also be capable of firing projectiles, but are not typically associated with the term "ball projectile." A battlefield may be a location where a ball projectile is used, but it is not where the projectile is shot out of. A tornado is a natural phenomenon and does not relate to the context of the question.
wave | Knowledge: The phrase "sees his or her friend nearby" suggests that the person is likely to greet or acknowledge the friend in some way. The option "wave" is the most common and appropriate response in this context. "Experience life" is generalized and doesn't make sense in this context. "Cross road" is irrelevant and doesn't have any connection to meeting a friend. "Thank god" is also not related to acknowledging a friend. "Man crew" is a random set of words with no relevance to the context of the sentence.
anxiety | Knowledge: Biting nails is often a nervous habit or behavior associated with anxiety, stress, or nervousness. This means that the person may be experiencing some level of discomfort or unease, rather than relaxation or contentment. The other options do not fit the context, as they imply positive or neutral states of mind rather than a negative or uncomfortable one.
quarry | Knowledge: An excavation site refers to an area where digging or excavation occurs, often for the purpose of uncovering buried objects or structures. A quarry is a type of excavation site that specifically refers to a place where rocks, minerals, or other materials are extracted from the earth. Therefore, it is more likely that a quarry would be near an excavation site rather than a shopping mall, city, or even a state like Montana. A work area could be near an excavation site if the excavation is being done for construction or industrial purposes.
fairgrounds | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place where you would eat lots of fried foods on a stick is a location that is associated with events or gatherings where food vendors are selling a variety of fried foods. These types of events are commonly held at fairgrounds, where carnival rides and games are also found. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
graduate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned has been a student for four years and is now reaching a milestone where they will no longer be a student. This milestone is usually associated with graduating from college or university, which is the act of receiving a degree or diploma for completing a course of study. The other options may be related to being a student, but they do not accurately reflect the end of the four-year period mentioned in the sentence.
sun-resistant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is sensitive to sunlight, which means she may be prone to sunburn or other negative effects of UV radiation. To protect herself from these effects, she wears thick sunscreen. The most appropriate answer, therefore, is "sun-resistant," which means she is resistant to the harmful effects of the sun. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not describe Sarah's ability to resist or protect herself from the sun.
casino | Knowledge: Gambling is often associated with casinos, where people go specifically to play games of chance and bet on various outcomes. While gamblers could potentially be found at a race track or a bar, these locations are less commonly associated with gambling than casinos. "Back horses" is not a location and "building" is too vague to give any indication of where gamblers might be found.
make others happy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is dressed as a clown, which is often associated with performing or entertaining. Therefore, the most logical answer would be that the person is hoping to make others happy. This is a common goal for clowns, who often perform at parties, festivals, and other events to entertain and bring joy to others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
prepare food | Knowledge: The word "prepare" means to get something ready for use or consumption, which indicates that the correct answer involves some form of food preparation. Going to a restaurant or getting food could involve someone else preparing the food, but it may not be the case that the person themselves is actually preparing the food. Similarly, saying grace is a religious act of giving thanks before a meal, but it does not necessarily involve preparing or consuming food in itself. Cooking food is also a form of food preparation, but it is more specific than the general act of preparing food, and therefore may not be the best answer in this context.
kiss | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Betty are in a romantic relationship, and that they engage in a specific activity when they are alone together. Of the choices provided, kissing is the most likely activity for a romantic couple to engage in while alone together. Proposing to a woman can be done in private, but it is not an activity that a couple typically engages in together, and singing, living life, and dancing are all very broad and non-specific activities that do not fit the context of the sentence as well as kissing does.
cloy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the banana was sweet because it was "full of sugar", and yet it was green suggesting that the banana was not yet ripe. If a banana is not yet ripe, it can be hard and starchy, making it difficult to eat, and the fact that the banana was "full of sugar" suggests that it might have been cloying, which means overly sweet or sickly. Therefore, the best answer is 'cloy'. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
oven | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the meat needs to be cooked for a significant amount of time, at least four hours, which suggests that it needs to be slow-cooked. Using a pot or a frying pan may not be suitable for slow cooking because the meat will be exposed to direct heat. A ham sandwich and a butcher shop are not relevant to the cooking process. Therefore, the correct answer is an oven.
compassion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John believes that understanding people better leads to a deeper sense of something. The word "compassion" is often associated with understanding and empathy towards others, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have a clear connection to the concept of understanding people better.
drink water | Knowledge: Thirst is a clear signal that the body needs hydration, and the most appropriate way to quench thirst is to drink water. Eating may temporarily satisfy hunger, but will not provide the necessary hydration. Sunny days and compliments are not relevant to the context of the question. "All kinds of things" is too broad and does not provide a specific solution to the person's thirst.
catching fish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friend is already fishing, which means he is likely to be catching fish. The phrase "out there" implies that the friend is in a location where fishing is possible, and the fact that he surprised the speaker suggests that he was not expected to be there. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they do not relate to fishing or being "out there."
cut there | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person has long hair that can be styled into a ponytail. The only choice that relates to hair length is "cut there," which suggests that the person went to a hair salon or barbershop to have their hair trimmed or cut. The other options (such as coloring, combing, braiding, or washing) do not involve shortening the length of the hair.
river | Knowledge: Salmon are known for their anadromous lifecycle, which means they migrate from the ocean to freshwater rivers and streams to spawn. This process is essential to the survival of the species and is a well-known aspect of salmon biology. While salmon may occasionally be found in aquariums, ponds or seas, the context of the question clearly suggests that the correct answer is a freshwater habitat, which is most commonly a river.
office | Knowledge: A ring binder is a type of folder used for organizing papers, and budgets are often created and maintained in an office setting. Therefore, it is logical that a ring binder containing budgets would be found in an office. The other options do not have a strong connection to budgets or the use of a ring binder.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John ate until he was full, which suggests he was at a place where food was being served in large quantities, such as a restaurant. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (e.g., dining room and cupboard are locations where food is stored, while shelf does not indicate any connection to food at all). "Stomach" is the result of John eating, not the location where he ate.
bookshelf | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the bookend was placed on a shelf, which suggests that the location is likely to be a bookshelf. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not involve placing something on a shelf. A pair may refer to a pair of bookends, but it does not provide information about the location of the bookend. The other options, school cafeteria and library book, do not suggest a location where a bookend may be placed.
floor | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sally put newspaper on the floor due to having two dogs. This is a common practice for dog owners as the newspaper can be used to absorb any messes that the dogs make. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
roof | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the squirrel is moving horizontally between two gutters, which is most likely to occur on a roof. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A park or forest would not have gutters, chipmunks are not known for crossing gutters, and muddy water would not be a viable route for a small animal like a squirrel.
kalahari desert | Knowledge: Wild gazelles are a type of antelope that can be found in various habitats, but they are often associated with dry and arid regions such as the Kalahari desert. The open plain option could also be a possibility, but it is a less specific answer compared to the Kalahari desert option. The sheep pen, trophy room, and ball gown options are unlikely to be places where John might find wild gazelles.
water | Knowledge: Bleach is often used as a disinfectant and is commonly added to water to kill bacteria. The sentence suggests that there was a bacteria scare, and adding bleach to the well would be a logical step in addressing the issue. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tropical rain forest | Knowledge: The use of the word "tropical" suggests that the sloth was likely in a warm, humid environment. The mention of Portuguese being spoken may indicate that the location is in a region where Portuguese is commonly spoken, such as Brazil, which has a large portion of the Amazon rainforest within its borders. The use of the phrase "tropical rain forest" encompasses both the warm, humid climate and the possible Portuguese-speaking region, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
vision | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's strength as a sound engineer stems from his ability to understand the world through sound, indicating that he might have a vision impairment. This would explain why he relies on sound as his primary way of perceiving the world around him. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that can be used to determine the correct answer.
hotel room | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about a situation where someone is away from their own home, possibly staying in a different city for work. In this scenario, the most likely option for taking a bath would be a hotel room. Hotels typically provide bathrooms with showers or bathtubs, so it makes sense that this would be the correct answer. The other options are either irrelevant (such as Greece) or clearly not viable for taking a bath (such as a public fountain).
exercise and companionship | Knowledge: The question implies that walking a dog has multiple benefits. One of the benefits is exercise, which can be gained from walking for a long period. Another benefit is companionship, which can be gained from spending time with a pet. The other options, such as poop and sore feet, are not inherent benefits of walking a dog but rather potential side effects. Pride and tiredness may be subjective experiences but are not directly related to the act of walking a dog.
study literature | Knowledge: The question asks about becoming a good writer in college, and studying literature is a common way for aspiring writers to develop their writing skills. By studying literature, students can analyze different writing styles and techniques, learn about literary traditions and movements, and hone their critical thinking skills. The other options do not relate to the topic of becoming a good writer.
get tired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam is not skilled at running long distances, which implies that he may struggle or tire easily if he attempted one. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feel humiliated | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's reputation was damaged when they were exposed as a liar, which would likely result in feelings of shame and embarrassment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
earn money | Knowledge: The main goal of work outside of the home is to earn money. This is typically the reason why individuals seek employment and is a central aspect of modern society where most people need to work to support themselves and their families. While other options may also be benefits or outcomes of working, earning money is the primary reason for most people.
encyclopedia | Knowledge: An encyclopedia is a reference work that contains information on a vast range of topics. It typically provides detailed explanations and definitions of terms, and is organized alphabetically for easy access. Since the question is asking about the definition of a sloth, an encyclopedia would be the best source of information for this type of question. The other options do not have the same informational value as an encyclopedia for the purpose of looking up definitions.
home office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is considering the cost of ink, which is typically used for printing. This strongly suggests that the person is talking about purchasing a new printer for a home office rather than for a car, school, work, or newspaper office. The cost of ink is often a major consideration for people who print a lot, especially in a home office setting where they may need to print documents or pictures regularly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
reproduce | Knowledge: August is typically breeding season for many bird species, so it is likely that the birds were looking to reproduce. Building a nest and picking berries are also behaviors commonly associated with birds during breeding season. However, breathing and looking at the sky do not seem related to the context of the sentence.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person wants to keep their lemonade cold to make it more refreshing. The best option for keeping a drink cold is a refrigerator, as this appliance maintains a consistent low temperature. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and do not explain how to make the lemonade more refreshing.
write letter | Knowledge: The question is asking for the least aggressive way to show anger. Writing a letter is a non-violent and peaceful way to express one's emotions. It allows the person to organize and communicate their thoughts without resorting to physical harm. The other options, such as releasing energy, punching or breaking a leg, involve some form of physical violence or harm, which would be considered aggressive ways to show anger. Passing sentence may also be a form of aggression, as it involves judging and punishing another person.
sky | Knowledge: The question is asking where someone would be likely to see a moving airplane, which suggests that the airplane is in flight. The most likely place to see a moving airplane in flight would be in the sky, since airplanes are designed to fly in the air. While airplanes may be present at military bases, airports, or airplane hangars, these places are not necessarily associated with airplanes that are actively in motion or visible to the general public. Additionally, the spelling of "hanger" is incorrect and does not refer to a place where airplanes are typically seen.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is working a shift in a location where they are primarily standing in the kitchen. The option "restaurant" is the most logical answer as this type of workplace usually involves kitchen work and standing for long periods. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence or are unlikely scenarios.
affluent |  | Knowledge: The phrase "well off" suggests that the person is financially comfortable or wealthy. The word "affluent" means having a lot of money or wealth, which is the most fitting choice among the given options. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
weather | Knowledge: Rain is a type of weather phenomenon that occurs when water droplets fall from clouds towards the Earth's surface. Snow is also a type of precipitation but differs from rain in that it forms at colder temperatures and as ice crystals. Disneyland and forest do not have any relevance to the context of the question. Air is a general term that refers to the mixture of gases present in the Earth's atmosphere, which includes the components that make up weather systems like rain.
airport | Knowledge: Since John wants to reach a large and diverse group from many places, airports are a logical choice. Airports are typically populated by people from different geographic regions and cultural backgrounds, providing an opportunity for John to distribute his religious tracts to a wide and varied audience. The other options are unlikely to have the same level of diversity and reach as an airport.
lost | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is using a metal detector to search for a ring, which implies that the ring has been lost and not found. The context also suggests that the ring was lost while the person was pulling weeds, further supporting the idea that the ring was misplaced or lost in some way. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
inebriation | Knowledge: Alcohol is known to impair cognitive and physical abilities, leading to the state of inebriation. Vomiting and frequent urination may also be side effects of alcohol consumption, but they do not necessarily always happen. Hilarity and singing may be common reactions to alcohol, but they are not universal and do not necessarily always happen after consuming alcohol.
orchestra | Knowledge: Conductors are typically associated with leading orchestras, and are commonly seen raising and flailing their arms in the air to signal the musicians. This action helps to keep the musicians in sync and on tempo. While a conductor may also lead an opera or choir, the specific reference to flailing arms in the air suggests that the correct answer is orchestra, where this action is most commonly seen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
applause | Knowledge: While the other options may indicate different types of reactions from the audience, applause is the most commonly associated expression with liking a performance. Audience members typically clap their hands together to show appreciation for the performer, which is why applause is the correct answer. Smiling or a standing ovation may also indicate a positive reaction, but they are less commonly associated with expressing enjoyment of a performance. Music does not indicate an audience reaction at all, while a grimace is a negative expression that suggests dislike or discomfort.
might dream |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something could happen after going to bed that may have both positive and negative outcomes. Dreaming is a common occurrence while sleeping, and dreams can be either good or bad, explaining why it is a possible answer. Insomnia, needing a nap later on, and feeling refreshed all suggest negative or positive outcomes, but not both. Good sleep is a positive outcome, but does not allow for the possibility of a negative outcome.
adverse reaction | Knowledge: The question is asking for a negative response that someone might have towards a talkative person, indicating that the person does not want to engage in conversation. The phrase "not wanting to have someone talking to them" suggests that the person may have an adverse or negative reaction to the talkative person, perhaps due to annoyance or discomfort. The other options, such as increased understanding or rumors spread, do not make sense in the context of not wanting to talk to someone. Boredom or a headache may be a possible outcome of having to deal with a talkative person, but the phrase "not wanting to have someone talking to them" implies a more active response.
guilty conscience | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man is experiencing some sort of psychological distress or guilt after committing murder, which is typically associated with a guilty conscience. This feeling may be intensified by the fact that he can still hear the victim's heart beating, a sign that the experience is still fresh in his mind. The other options do not directly relate to the theme of guilt or regret.
males | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characteristic being discussed pertains to a dominant sex within a species. In many species of animals, males are often the dominant ones, meaning they possess traits that allow them to take charge of the group, fight for mating rights, and protect their offspring. The other options are not commonly associated with dominance within a species.
landfill | Knowledge: A broken keyboard is unlikely to be found in a school, music store, thrift store, or office, as these locations do not typically deal with the disposal of electronic waste. A landfill, on the other hand, is a common destination for discarded keyboards and other electronics. This knowledge allows us to choose the correct answer from the list of options.
believe in god | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while a computer is capable of processing information and making choices, there is something that it cannot do that is different from these functions. It is unlikely that a computer has the capability to have religious beliefs or faith, which explains why it cannot believe in God. The other options are all functions or capabilities that a computer is typically able to perform.
siberia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that koalas are not found in the environment that James mistakenly went to. Since Siberia is a cold, arctic region, it is unlikely that koalas would be found there. Therefore, Siberia is the correct answer. The other options - jungle, great outdoors, Queensland, and wilderness - do not provide any clear indication of whether koalas can or cannot be found in those environments.
cupboard | Knowledge: The question suggests that the item being stored does not need to be kept cold, which rules out the option of a refrigerator. This leaves the options of cupboard, corner, night stand, and bookstore. However, a shelf inside a cupboard is a common place to store non-perishable food items such as dry goods and canned goods, making the correct answer cupboard. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
written on paper | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child only learned music through hearing it, indicating that they did not have access to sheet music or any form of written notation. This connection is particularly clear in the phrase "never even seen it," which implies a lack of exposure to music in written form. Therefore, the correct answer is "written on paper." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bleeding | Knowledge: The phrase "stabbing to death the buck" suggests that the animal was wounded and bleeding, which would also explain why it was "everywhere." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fun to play | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that parents encourage their kids to play baseball for a specific reason. While the other options could be reasons why parents discourage their kids from playing baseball, they are not reasons why parents encourage their kids to play baseball. "Fun to play" is often cited as a reason why parents encourage their kids to participate in sports, especially at a young age. Playing baseball can also help kids develop important skills, such as teamwork and hand-eye coordination.
neighborhood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bungalow was located in a densely populated area where people could easily walk by and interact with those inside. This is a characteristic typically associated with neighborhoods, where it is common to see people walking, biking, or just hanging out on the street. The other options, such as suburbs or woods, do not have this same kind of bustling energy or pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.
point | Knowledge: The sentence uses conditional language, suggesting that having a head is a prerequisite for having a certain ability. Out of the given choices, "point" is the only one that makes logical sense in this context, as it is a common ability associated with having a head. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is referring to a piece of furniture or structure that has foot rails. The options "bookcase" and "repair shop" do not fit this description. "Toolbox" and "toolkit" are possible options, but the fact that the person always kept a screwdriver behind it implies that it is a place they frequent often and casually - this does not fit the context of a toolbox or toolkit, which are typically stored away and used for specific tasks. "Bar" is the best option as it is a place where foot rails are common, and the casual use of a screwdriver could indicate that the person frequents bars often enough to keep a screwdriver there.
china cabinet | Knowledge: The question suggests that the saucer is not in use and is being kept for display purposes. A china cabinet is typically used to store and display delicate, decorative dishes, and is therefore a logical location to keep a saucer for visual enjoyment. The other options do not offer a space for displaying items, with the exception of a tea room, which is not a common fixture in most homes.
attempting to communicate | Knowledge: The question is about the purpose or goal of talking, and the choice that best fits that context is "attempting to communicate." Talking is a form of communication, and the act of talking implies an attempt to convey meaning or information to others. While some of the other choices may be related to talking in some way (e.g., "getting to know people" may be a reason why someone wants to engage in conversation), they do not capture the main purpose of why people talk, which is to communicate.
till the soil | Knowledge: Tilling the soil is the first step in preparing the ground for planting crops. When soil is tilled, it is loosened and aerated, which makes it easier for the roots of the plants to grow and absorb nutrients. Planting seeds, producing food, farming land, and growing corn are all part of the process of farming, but none of them would be possible without first preparing the soil by tilling it.
victory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking the hill would lead to an advantage, which implies a positive outcome. Historically, taking high ground in battles has often been a strategic advantage, as it provides a better vantage point for surveying the battlefield and launching attacks. This would suggest that the likely result of taking the hill would be victory. The other options do not necessarily follow logically from the context of the sentence.
exceptional | Knowledge: The word "genius" is usually used to describe someone with exceptional intelligence and talent in a particular area. Therefore, it makes sense for the answer to be "exceptional" as it implies someone who is beyond ordinary in all subjects. The other choices do not accurately capture the idea of someone who is exceptionally talented in all subjects.
french fries | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the potato was sliced and fried, which is a common method of cooking french fries. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, mentioning that the potato was sliced implies that it was being prepared as a side dish or snack, which further supports the idea that the cook was making french fries.
joyfulness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is happy, which is commonly associated with the emotion of joyfulness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase "best things in life" is subjective and could vary from person to person, while a slim waist, own house, and comfortable shoes may contribute to overall happiness but do not necessarily guarantee it.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a goal and had finally saved enough money to achieve that goal. The word "satisfaction" implies a feeling of accomplishment or contentment, which is a common emotion when someone achieves a long-desired goal. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bathroom is located in a place where multiple people have access to it, such as a hotel. The fact that it is cleaned every day implies that it is a public bathroom that is used frequently. The other options, such as a neighbor's house or a flat, may also have shared bathrooms, but the context of the sentence does not support those options.
beautiful | Knowledge: The question implies that the girl desires to improve her appearance. The available choices all describe physical features or states of being, with "beautiful" being the most commonly used descriptor for attractive appearances of women. The other choices ("pretty," "pleasing," "handsome," "gorgeous," "pregnant") do not accurately reflect the implication of the question.
bruise | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the victim experienced physical harm as a result of being punched, which could manifest as pain, a bruise, or both. However, the use of the word "find" suggests that the victim may have noticed a physical mark or injury on their body, which would most likely be a bruise since it is a visible sign of trauma caused by blunt force. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
growth | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the process of watering the seeds after planting them in the ground results in something growing, which is likely to be plants. Additionally, the other choices don't fit with the logic of the sentence. Harvesting implies a later stage of plant development, dying and feeling sad are opposite of the desired outcome of gardening, and "plants" is a redundant option.
dangerous | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bears in the specific section that the guide is referring to are a potential danger. The word "safe" implies that there is a risk of harm, so it is likely that the bears are known to attack or pose a threat in some way. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "easily spooked" implies that the bears are more scared of the humans than the other way around, while "in danger" refers to the bears themselves being in danger rather than posing a threat to humans. "Precarious" is too vague, and "harmful" could refer to any number of dangers in the area.
large city | Knowledge: Delicatessens are typically located in urban areas with high foot traffic, making a large city the most likely answer. Michigan and hometown do not provide enough information about the specific location of a deli, while shop and mall could potentially be locations for a deli, but are not as commonly associated with this type of establishment as a large city.
educational | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that not all video games are just for fun and entertainment, but some serve a different purpose. The option "educational" makes sense in this context because there are many video games designed to teach specific skills or subjects, such as math, history, or language. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the idea that some video games can be more than just fun.
ground | Knowledge: Plants usually start from seeds planted in the ground, which provides them with the necessary nutrients, moisture, and anchorage to grow. The other options do not make sense in the context of plant growth: "at the beginning" is too vague, "surface of earth" is redundant with "ground," "windowsill" implies that the plants are already grown, and "park" does not provide the necessary conditions for plant growth.
confession | Knowledge: The fact that the man is reading the Bible before talking to a priest suggests that he is seeking spiritual guidance or advice, which is often done during confession. Confession is a sacrament in the Catholic Church in which a person confesses their sins to a priest, who then absolves them of those sins. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
go back to school | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to the end of summer and what happens next for a child. The most likely scenario is that the child will be returning to school after the summer break, making "go back to school" the correct answer. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence or are not as likely to happen after the summer.
Canada | Knowledge: Bald eagles are primarily found in North America, and Canada is one of the countries in the northern part of this continent. Bald eagle preserves are areas where these birds are protected and their habitats are conserved. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
belittlement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's friends did not treat him with respect, and that as a result he suffered something at their hands. "Belittlement" means to make someone feel small or unimportant, which fits the context of the sentence. "Humiliate," "embarrassed," and "irreverence" are all similar in meaning but do not precisely match the context of the sentence. "Contempt" means disdain or disrespect, but it is less specific than "belittlement" and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context.
incompetent | Knowledge: The question is asking for a negative characteristic of a real estate agent, and stealing, exaggerating, and covering up are all unethical or illegal behaviors that would not be associated with a reputable agent. Charming is a positive trait that a real estate agent might possess, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Incompetence, on the other hand, would lead to poor performance and negative outcomes for clients, making it a likely choice for a bad real estate agent.
disaster | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that a hurricane can have a catastrophic impact on a city. The term "disaster" is commonly used to describe events that cause significant damage or loss of life, and hurricanes are notorious for their ability to bring destruction to the areas they hit. The other options, such as rain or tornadoes, may be associated with hurricanes, but they do not capture the full impact that hurricanes can have on a city.
stream | Knowledge: The question asks for a location where fish can be found other than a refrigerator or a market, indicating that the answer should be a natural or outdoor location. A stream is a place where fish are commonly found swimming in the wild, making it the best answer. Mirach, on the other hand, is not a known location for fish. Aquariums are man-made places where fish can be kept, but not a location where they can be found in the wild.
side of road | Knowledge: When a vehicle experiences a breakdown, it is typically pulled over to the side of the road to avoid obstructing traffic. The other answer choices do not provide a likely scenario for where a broken-down automobile would be found.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not want to display his rug but his wife insisted on it. Therefore, he compromised and placed it under something. The most likely option for this would be a table, as it is a common item that can be used to display objects, and it would also hide the rug from view to some degree. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
forest | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the pond is surrounded by tall buildings, which would not be a typical feature of a forest. Forests are typically associated with tall trees and natural surroundings, rather than man-made structures like tall buildings. The other options are all plausible locations for a pond with tall buildings around it.
welcome guests | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "lit up" implies that the host was excited about someone arriving, which makes the most sense in the context of welcoming guests. The other options do not fit the description of someone who is excitedly waiting for guests to arrive, such as mounting a horse or offering food to guests.
dental office | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are multiple dentists located in one place that can be visited, which is commonly found in a dental office. The other options, such as Las Vegas or a garden, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The phone book and town could potentially have multiple dentists, but they do not specifically mention a location where they can be visited.
circus | Knowledge: The sentence describes a performance that involves lions, elephants, and acrobats, which are all commonly associated with a circus. A circus is a type of entertainment that features various acts or performances, including animal performances and acrobatics. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
choking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating hamburger too fast without swallowing has negative consequences. One likely consequence in this scenario is choking, as hamburger is a solid food that requires proper chewing and swallowing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
got injured | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was someone who enjoyed using violence, but his attitude changed after something happened to him. The phrase "when it was him that it was" implies that he experienced the effects of violence firsthand, which is most likely to have happened if he got injured. None of the other options offer a plausible explanation for what could have happened to James to make him change his tune about violence.
grown ups | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are some children who wish they were grown ups so that they could have more freedom to do whatever they want. This is a common desire among children who feel restricted by the rules and limitations placed upon them by adults. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cemetary | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spirits are haunting a location that is outside, which rules out options like a bar or liquor cabinet. The reference to a funeral home and haunted house may seem plausible, but the specific mention of "spirits" seems to suggest that the haunting is occurring in a place where people have been laid to rest, making a cemetary the most likely answer.
feeling guilty | Knowledge: The question suggests that lying constantly has a negative consequence, and the opposite would therefore be a positive consequence. Feeling guilty is a common consequence of lying, and it would be the opposite of a positive consequence. The other choices do not fit the context of the question or are not opposite in meaning to lying.
frustration | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the act of continuously applying for jobs without receiving any responses can result in negative emotions. The phrase "no calls come back" suggests that the person is not being contacted for interviews or job offers, which can be disheartening and frustrating. The options "hope" and "happiness" are unlikely because the context implies a negative outcome. "Working hard" may be a result of the frustration, but it is not the direct consequence being described.
grass | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something growing in a field that can be swatted at using a stick. The other options, such as woods, forest, bicycle spokes, or home, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Grass, however, is a common plant that grows in fields, and people may use sticks to swat away bugs or weeds from the grass.
post office | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about the location where computers are used for sorting. While computers are used in a variety of settings, including universities, labyrinths, and large cities, the most likely location for computer sorting is the post office. This is because the post office is responsible for sorting and delivering a large volume of mail and packages, which requires complex sorting systems that rely on computers. MIT is a prestigious university that is known for its technology programs, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer.
alabama | Knowledge: The question is asking for the name of a state that comes first alphabetically and has a high number of people who play the fiddle. The choices include two states that start with the letter "A," Alabama and Alaska. Since Alabama comes first alphabetically, it is the correct answer. The other options, such as "violin case" and "orchestra," do not pertain to the question and can be eliminated as possible answers.
please | Knowledge: Using "please" when requesting something is a polite and socially accepted way of making a request. The other options do not make sense in the context of asking someone to entertain you. "Hot" and "happy" are adjectives that do not fit the context, while "liked" and "now" do not express the request for entertainment.
pain | Knowledge: Standing in line for an extended period of time can cause discomfort and strain on the feet, leading to pain. Frustration and anger are emotional responses to the situation, while lime scale and order do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
high places | Knowledge: Cats are known for their climbing and perching abilities, which allows them to survey their surroundings and feel safe. They also enjoy basking in sunlight, which makes the option "beam of sunlight" somewhat tempting. However, the sentence specifically asks about the type of area, and high places (such as trees, shelves, or the top of furniture) are more commonly associated with cats than any of the other options.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pit being referred to is likely the pit of a fruit, such as a cherry or peach. It also suggests that the pit has been burned, which could potentially occur from a backyard bonfire or grill. The other options - hungry, mine - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
health problems | Knowledge: The question suggests that eating hamburgers in excess can have negative long-term consequences for a person's health. This is a common understanding, as diets high in saturated fats and processed meats have been linked to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems. The other options (death, gas, McDonald's, nausea) are not necessarily direct consequences of eating hamburgers in excess, and therefore do not fit as the answer.
farmers market | Knowledge: John wanted grapes, which are typically not found in a kitchen, fruit basket or bowl of fruit at home. Fields may have grapes, but it is unlikely that John would have access to one. A farmers market is a likely place to find a variety of fruits and vegetables, including grapes.
start | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the racers are preparing to begin a competition, which typically starts with all participants lining up at a designated starting point. The other options, such as podium or train, are not typically associated with the beginning of a race. The option "ready emotionally and physically" may be necessary for a successful race, but it does not address the specific action the racers need to take at the moment.
classroom | Knowledge: The context suggests that the person is getting their paper back with corrections, which is a common occurrence in a classroom setting. Conferences typically involve discussions with others and may not involve receiving papers back with corrections. A bench, cabinet, and notebook do not have any clear connection to receiving a paper back with corrections.
night sky | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the emphasis is on where humans are able to see the stars, rather than where they exist in the universe. The most likely option is the night sky, as this is where stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth. Outer space, constellation, galaxy, and universe are all related to stars, but they are not necessarily connected to the ability of humans to see them.
gymnasium | Knowledge: The word "exercise" implies physical activity, and a ball is commonly used in sports or fitness activities. The options "playground" and "toy store" suggest a more recreational use of a ball, while "bank" and "bowling alley" have no apparent connection to balls or exercise equipment. "Gymnasium" is the most appropriate answer as it is a place dedicated to physical fitness and likely to have a variety of exercise equipment, including balls for different types of workouts.
gas | Knowledge: Beans are known to cause gas in some people due to their high fiber content. This can lead to discomfort and bloating. While beans can provide energy, the sentence suggests that the focus is on the potential negative side effects of eating them for breakfast. Fullness and stomach ache could be potential outcomes, but they are not specifically tied to beans like gas and indigestion are.
send | Knowledge: The other options do not make sense in the context of replying to something. "Give" and "mute" do not apply to replying, "email" is a method of sending a reply, but not the action of replying itself, and "question" is not related to the action of replying. "Send" is the most fitting answer as it refers to the action of transmitting the reply to the recipient.
choice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is hesitant about doing something that is perceived as bad. The word "choice" indicates that she may feel like she doesn't have much control over the situation and is forced to make a decision that she doesn't want to make. The other options are not connected to the context of the sentence and do not help to answer the question.
Texas | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Sam's living situation fits a "stereotype" and that "everyone from out of state thinks he's a cowboy." This suggests that the state he lives in has a strong association with cowboys and ranching culture. Texas is famously known for its ranches and cowboys, so it is the most likely location where Sam might live based on the given information. The other options do not have as strong of an association with cowboys or ranching culture.
falling asleep  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that she was going to bed, which is typically associated with trying to fall asleep. The other options do not necessarily relate directly to going to bed at 11 at night, as someone might relax or rest without necessarily going to bed, for example. Additionally, "dreaming of" and "laziness" do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not suggest any specific reason for going to bed at that time.
dentist's office | Knowledge: Mouthwash is often provided in little paper cups at dentist's offices, where patients are asked to rinse their mouths before or after a dental procedure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
All options could potentially require a small table, so there is no single correct answer. Knowledge: The context of the question does not provide any specific information about why someone might need a small table, so each option could be a viable choice depending on the situation. For example, a small table would be useful in a kitchen for food prep or as a side table in an apartment, while it could also be used as a demonstration table or a display in a furniture store.
body | Knowledge: The flu is a viral illness that primarily affects the respiratory system, which is located in the body. While it can cause some digestive symptoms (nausea, diarrhea), it is not primarily associated with the stomach. Airplanes and hospitals may be places where people are more likely to come into contact with the flu virus, but they are not causes of the illness itself. The elderly population may be more susceptible to serious complications from the flu, but this does not necessarily mean that they are more likely to contract it.
rainbow | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the little girl smiled, which suggests that what she saw was something positive or beautiful. The option "happy" could be a possibility, but the sentence also mentions that the little girl pointed out something specific, which makes the option "make others happy too" less likely. The option "cry" and "frown" have negative connotations and would not fit with the positive tone of the sentence. The option "rainbow" is a common thing that people point out, especially children, because of its bright and colorful appearance.
synagogue | Knowledge: The mention of a Menorah and lighting candles is a Jewish tradition, specifically during the holiday of Hanukkah. Hanukkah is primarily celebrated in synagogues, which makes it likely that the sentence is referring to a synagogue and not any of the other options. The mention of "everybody" suggests that multiple people were present to witness the lighting of the Menorah, which is commonly done as a group activity during Hanukkah services.
having fun | Knowledge: Playing basketball is a popular recreational activity that many people enjoy for fun and exercise. It is not typically associated with negative experiences such as pain or injuries, although those can happen. "Crazy" does not make sense in this context, and "sweating" is a common result of physical activity, but not the reason someone would choose to play basketball.
mall | Knowledge: Revolving doors are commonly found in large public buildings, particularly in shopping malls and department stores. The other options, such as earth and New York, do not make sense contextually, while a bank may have a revolving door but may not have millions of them.
skyscraper | Knowledge: The use of the term "floor" indicates that the structure being referred to has multiple levels or stories. This is a common feature of skyscrapers, which are tall buildings designed to maximize the use of vertical space. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with tall buildings or multiple stories.
rocky mountains | Knowledge: the sentence suggests that the context is about a range where bald eagles can be found. The Rocky Mountains are known to have a significant population of these birds, and this mountain range spans across many northern states and Canadian provinces. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
mountain | Knowledge: A mountain is a type of hill that is typically taller than other types of hills and often has a pointed or peaked shape. Mountains are typically formed through geological processes such as tectonic activity or volcanic eruptions. The other options, such as flat land, pool, valley, and flat ground, are not types of hills, and do not accurately match the definition of a hill provided in the question.
become water | Knowledge: Ice is a solid form of water that melts when heated. The sun is a source of heat, so it is likely that ice will melt and turn into water when exposed to the sun. The other options do not relate to the behavior of ice when exposed to heat.
office building  | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that executives sit on the top floor of a building. The options "office building" and "tall building" are closely related to the context of the sentence, as executives are often associated with offices and the top floor of a tall building can be seen as a prestigious location. The options "chair", "apartment building", and "apartment highrise" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
mix | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are socializing at a bar, and the bartender is serving cocktails. The most likely action that the bartender would take is to mix the cocktails since that is their primary job function. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
cash register | Knowledge: A cash register is typically where money is kept in a business setting, making it a likely safe place to keep money. Pockets and on the ground are not secure locations, and a casino or supermarket may have higher risks of theft or loss. Therefore, the answer must be cash register.
lamb | Knowledge: A sheep during its first year of life is commonly referred to as a lamb. This is a well-known term in the field of animal husbandry and is used to differentiate between the different stages of a sheep's life. The other options either have no connection to sheep or are incorrect terms for a young sheep.
suffering pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that not eating enough food has negative consequences on the body, including the stomach. This is supported by common knowledge that a lack of proper nutrition can lead to discomfort, pain, and potentially more serious health issues. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the question.
correct | Knowledge: The question is asking about the proper way to tie a bow. The word "correct" indicates that there is a specific method or technique that should be followed. The other options - light, lightly, loosely, and slowly - do not provide any information about the proper way to tie a bow.
fire | Knowledge: Log cabins are typically heated with wood-burning stoves or fireplaces, which suggests that the most likely heat source would be fire. The other options are not typically associated with heating a log cabin, as a house or home could refer to any type of dwelling and a bedroom or sun is not a source of heat on its own.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had a space in his house that he referred to as a "man cave," which is typically a space reserved for men to relax and entertain themselves in. The fact that the space also included a sofa bed suggests that it doubled as a guest room, which is a common practice for homeowners who want to make the most of their space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
play sports | Knowledge: The term "athlete" typically refers to someone who regularly participates in sports and physical activity, so it's safe to assume that the correct answer is related to sports. Option 2 contradicts the idea of an athlete, as they would not be expected to rest excessively. Option 3 is too generic and could apply to anyone, not just athletes. Option 4 is inappropriate and unethical, as not all athletes take steroids, and it suggests that cheating is an acceptable practice. Option 5 is ridiculous and doesn't make any sense in the context of the question. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "play sports."
doorknob | Knowledge: In a typical doorway, the object that would be used to open or close the door is the doorknob. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they either do not relate to a specific part of the doorway or describe objects that would not typically be found in a doorway.
gathering information | Knowledge: The sentence states that studying requires using multiple sources, which implies that the task involves collecting information from different places. Gathering information is a common step in completing a project, as it helps to create a foundation of knowledge that can be used to develop new ideas or solutions. The other options do not relate to the main idea of the sentence, and are therefore incorrect.
selling food | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about the actions of people who own restaurants. Owning a restaurant involves running a business where food is prepared and served to customers for a profit, so the answer that best fits the context is "selling food." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
opera | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the conductor and performers are singing in German, and this is a clue that the correct answer is related to classical music. The options "subway" and "broadway" are not likely to be correct, as they are not traditionally associated with classical music. "Listen to music" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information. The options "orchestra" and "opera" both seem plausible, but since the sentence mentions singing in German, "opera" is the more likely answer because operas are typically performed in their original language.
concert hall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is performing with a musical instrument (a harp), and that it is their first performance. This implies that the person is likely a musician who is just starting out in their career, and may not have played in a large venue before. A concert hall is a common location for musical performances, particularly for classical or orchestral music, which are both genres that could potentially feature a harp. The other options do not make as much sense, as they do not align with the idea of a formal performance in a significant venue.
sweat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running is a physically demanding and rigorous workout that causes the body to perspire, which is commonly referred to as sweating. The other options, such as dehydration or trip and fall, are not directly related to the physical exertion of running. Exercise and breathing hard are both results of running, but they are not specific to the question of what running works up.
move | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that birds are known for doing something that is related to their physical activity. Birds are known for their ability to fly, which requires a great deal of physical movement. They are also constantly on the move as they migrate to different parts of the world. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
both positive and negative | Knowledge: The question suggests that having faith in religion has both positive and negative aspects. Having faith can provide comfort and a sense of purpose, but it can also lead to division and hatred. The other options do not address the complex nature of faith in religion.
water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being discussed is not suitable for a canoe, which implies that it is shallow or not deep enough to comfortably navigate with a canoe. The other options do not provide any explanation for why it would be too shallow for a canoe.
delays | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tickets were supposed to arrive by a certain time but did not, leading to frustration for Sally who had been waiting in line for a long time. The fact that the line had not moved indicates that there may be some kind of delay, which would explain why the tickets had not arrived yet. The other options, such as being annoyed or sprinting, do not provide a clear explanation for the situation described in the sentence.
frame | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was famous for her needlepoint, which requires the use of a frame to hold the fabric taut while stitching. The fact that she grabbed a round wooden frame suggests that the needlepoint project she was working on was also round. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
attic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family photos were stored in a high and dusty location that required the person to climb a ladder to reach them. The most logical option that fits this description is the attic, which is a common storage space located high up in a house. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hunger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person decided to have lunch because it was the logical thing to do, implying that they were hungry and need sustenance to continue with their day. The other options may also be possible, but they do not fit the logical decision making that the sentence describes.
wine | Knowledge: Wine is a type of alcoholic beverage that is made from fermented grapes. Grapes are crushed and the juice is left to ferment with yeast, which converts the sugar into alcohol. The other options, such as beer and cider, are made from grains and apples respectively, while a distillery is a place where alcohol is distilled, but does not refer to a specific type of alcohol. Plane is not related to alcohol at all.
orchestra | Knowledge: A bassoon is a classical instrument commonly used in orchestral music. The options "make music" and "high school band" are too general and do not specify a particular setting where a bassoon may be played. A cricket stadium does not typically host musical performances, so it can be eliminated. The option "symphony" is similar to "orchestra" but generally refers to a specific type of musical composition, whereas "orchestra" refers to the group of musicians who perform the music. Therefore, the correct answer is "orchestra."
arguments | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Randy's lack of contribution to the household chores is causing his wife to have more work, which is causing her stress. This stress may lead to arguments between the couple, as they may have disagreements about the division of labor in the household. The other options, such as asthma or boredom, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
drug store | Knowledge: A double edged razor is a type of shaving razor that has a razor blade on each side of the razor head. It is commonly sold in stores that specialize in personal care products, such as drug stores and pharmacies. While shaving kits may also contain a double edged razor, this answer choice is less specific than drug store and could refer to a variety of products. The option shower is unlikely as it is not a common place to purchase razor blades.
well rested | Knowledge: The sentence implies that spending most of one's time resting is not necessarily a bad thing, and in fact may lead to feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. "Laziness" and "doing nothing" have negative connotations and suggest a lack of productivity or motivation, while "relaxation" suggests a deliberate effort to unwind and destress. "Falling asleep" implies that the person is constantly dozing off, which is not necessarily the same as resting. "Well rested" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to feeling refreshed and energized after a period of rest.
museum | Knowledge: Statues are often displayed in museums as works of art, historical artifacts, or cultural representations. While some statues may also be found in large cities or outside of churches, the most common place to view a variety of statues in one location would be a museum. Amusement parks are not typically known for their display of statues, and New York City is too broad of a category to be a clear answer.
rest up | Knowledge: The phrase "go to sleep" is often used as a command to encourage someone to rest their body and mind by sleeping. Therefore, the answer that best fits this context is "rest up." The other options do not accurately reflect the purpose of the command, which is to encourage rest and relaxation.
aim | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person won a prize for hitting a bottle, which suggests that they were engaged in some kind of target shooting activity. Having a good aim would be an important skill for this kind of activity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
museum | Knowledge: Art books are typically found in places that are dedicated to art, such as museums, galleries, or art libraries. While it is possible to find art books in other places like schools or bedrooms, the fact that the question specifies "on a shelf or two" suggests that it is asking about a collection of books that is organized and displayed in a cohesive manner, which is more likely to be found in a museum or gallery setting. The other options, such as a cabinet or cupboard, are more commonly used for storing items that are not displayed for public viewing.
draw attention to itself | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy put the product on display because he believed it would attract people's attention. The phrase "great attraction" also suggests that Billy thought the product would draw people's interest. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
tree trunk | Knowledge: Lizards are known to be able to climb vertical surfaces, and tree trunks are a common habitat for many species of lizards. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for lizards to live in, as they may not be able to access or survive in those areas. Undergrowth may be too low for some species, swimming pools are not natural habitats for lizards, deserts may be too hot and dry, and front porches are unlikely to provide the necessary resources for lizards to live there.
pleasure | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning about the world and what is good in it will likely result in a positive experience. The option "pleasure" is the only one that fits this description. The other options are negative and do not seem to relate to the idea of learning about the world and what is good in it.
container | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the condiments need to be separated from each other to prevent them from combining, which implies the need for individual containers. Using a cup or placing them on the table may not provide enough separation between the condiments, while a pantry is not a typical location for storing condiments. A refrigerator could also work, but it does not necessarily imply separation unless individual containers are used.
meeting | Knowledge: In a work context, a meeting typically refers to a gathering of colleagues or coworkers to exchange information, discuss ideas, make decisions, or solve problems. Meetings can take place in person or online, but the sentence does not suggest that the gathering is specifically online or internet-based. The option "break" refers to a pause from work, which is not related to exchanging information. "Manual" refers to a book or document that provides instruction or information, which is not related to a gathering of people.
churchyard | Knowledge: The word "municipalities" suggests that we are talking about towns or cities, and historically, many towns had a designated churchyard or cemetery for burials. Personal homes would not be a logical choice for a public cemetery, and "most cities" and "populated area" are too broad and vague. "Field" could be a possibility, but it would not be as common as a churchyard in most municipalities.
facing each other | Knowledge: In an interview, it is common for the interviewer and interviewee to sit facing each other. This allows for eye contact and better communication between the two parties. Round-table discussions typically involve multiple people sitting around a circular table, while "gather together" and "get angry" have no relevance to the context of an interview. "Believe in god" may be a personal belief or preference, but it does not relate to the physical positioning of people in an interview setting.
tube | Knowledge: Silicone is often stored in tubes, as it is frequently used as a sealant or adhesive in the construction and automotive industries. While it may be used for artificial breasts, storing it in that context is not common or typical. Silicone is not typically stored in a bag, hardware store, or contact lens.
tape | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the task involves recording something on an old answering machine. The most common medium used for recording on an old answering machine is a cassette tape, which is inserted into the machine to record and play back messages. The other options, such as a disket, recorder, or spell checker, do not have any clear connection to answering machines or recording messages.
having fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person played cards at the casino, but it does not specify their motivation for doing so. One possible reason is to have fun, as playing cards can be an enjoyable social activity. While it is also possible to win money or break even by playing cards, the sentence does not indicate that this was the person's intention. Wasting time or losing money are negative outcomes of gambling, and the sentence does not suggest that the person was trying to do either of these things.
dishearten | Knowledge: Empowerment is the process of giving someone the authority or confidence to take control of their life or situation. If someone does not feel empowered, they may feel discouraged or disheartened because they do not have the ability to make decisions or control their own life. The other options, such as forbid, prohibit, and ban, refer to preventing something from happening rather than describing a feeling. Give up suggests surrendering, but does not necessarily describe the feeling of lacking empowerment.
suffer pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hitting a person with a stick would cause some kind of physical harm, which is commonly associated with pain. It is logical to assume that being hit with a stick would cause discomfort and possibly injury, which would lead a person to suffer pain. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the physical consequences of being hit with a stick.
downtown | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking for a place to go shopping in a dense urban area. A downtown area typically has a variety of stores and shopping options within close proximity, making it a good choice for someone looking to shop in a city setting. Detroit is a specific city, not a suggestion for a shopping location. An elevator and workplace do not offer shopping opportunities, and a mall may not be located within an urban area.
action | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is unsure of what Dane has planned for her and is contemplating her response to this uncertainty. The options "new insights," "enlightenment," and "speak" don't fit with the context of the sentence. "Hesitation" could be a possible answer, but it is not definitive. "Action," however, fits well as it suggests that Sarah may have to take action at some point, but is currently unable to do so due to her uncertainty.
better themselves | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that quitting work and going back to school is a way for some people to improve or enhance themselves in some way. This could be through gaining new skills or knowledge, improving career prospects, or simply for personal growth and development. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
teach | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Josh's mother recognized his love for learning and wanted to support him in that interest. The most logical way to support a child who loves to learn is to teach them new things. Ordering Chinese takeaway or quitting do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while remembering information or forgetting do not contribute to the idea of actively supporting Josh's love of learning.
known person | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is not known to the people mentioned, but is known to the speaker. Therefore, the correct answer is "known person". The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
leave home | Knowledge: The question is asking about what an animal does when it becomes old, which suggests that it is referring to the behavior of animals in their natural habitats. When animals become old, they often leave their homes or territories in search of a new place to live, as they may no longer be able to fend off predators or compete with younger members of their species. This behavior is commonly observed in many species, such as elephants, wolves, and birds. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
terrarium | Knowledge: A terrarium is a container used to keep and display plants and small animals, including snakes. It is designed to mimic a natural environment and provide shelter and hiding places for the animals inside. Therefore, it is likely that a snake would easily be hidden in a terrarium, compared to the other options provided such as a living room or an outdoor forest. Kew gardens and tropical forests are also unlikely options as they are known for being well-manicured and maintained, making it less likely for a snake to hide there.
being laughed at | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman is experiencing embarrassment due to her comical falls on the ice. This would make it likely that she is growing sick of being laughed at by others. Hair pulling, contact with, lacerations, and injury do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
illumination | Knowledge: Lighting a match in a dark tunnel is not likely to start a fire, as there is likely nothing combustible in the immediate vicinity. The primary purpose of lighting a match in this context would be to provide illumination, as matches emit a small but bright flame. Heat is a byproduct of the flame, but not the primary reason for lighting the match. "Make fire" and "frustration" are unlikely choices, as lighting a match is a well-known method of creating a flame.
casino | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a lot of money, which is commonly associated with gambling and casinos. The mention of visiting a desert may also hint towards a specific location such as Las Vegas, which is known for its desert location and numerous casinos. The other options such as a bank account, race track, supermarket, and art show do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
warm hands | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is feeling cold and needs warmth. One way that the fire can help is by providing heat that can warm up the person's hands, which are typically the first parts of the body to get cold. The other options either do not relate to the context of the sentence or are negative (e.g. hurt people).
liquid | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the matter inside a can of soda is being described. Since soda is a beverage, it is in a liquid state. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
office building | Knowledge: The word "lawyers" suggests that the answer should be related to their profession or workplace. The option "office building" is the most relevant choice as it is a common location for lawyers to work from. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as signing documents and going to court are activities that lawyers do, rather than places they use. Apartments are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
free time | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the employer has a preference regarding when an employee plans their vacation. "Free time" is a logical choice as it implies that the employee is not taking time off during important work-related events, such as meetings. "Organization" and "imagination" do not make sense in this context, and "money" is not relevant to the timing of the vacation.
carpet or cellar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John has mold in his house, which can be found in damp and dark places. Carpets are a common place for mold growth since they can hold moisture, while cellars are often damp and poorly ventilated. The other options, such as jello or a refrigerator, are unlikely places for mold to grow.
love | Knowledge: The context indicates that the two people involved in the affair were motivated by their strong feelings for each other, as they were willing to risk causing harm to others in pursuit of their love. The other options are not as closely related to the context; marriage and fidelity suggest loyalty and commitment, scandal implies negative attention, and relationship may not capture the intensity of emotions driving the affair.
concert | Knowledge: The context suggests that James was at a wild event where drugs were being passed around, and it was likely a one-time event since he didn't know what drugs he took and it was the "last time." The most likely event where this scenario could occur is a concert or music festival, where people often engage in drug use. The other options do not fit the context or suggest a more controlled environment (like a doctor's office or university).
stress | Knowledge: Heart tests are often conducted during routine check-ups to assess the overall health of the heart. Stress tests are one type of heart test that is commonly used to measure how the heart responds to physical activity or stress. The other options do not have any clear connection to heart tests or check-ups.
insights | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man believes that sitting alone in silence helps him to think deeply and gain a better understanding of various topics. "Insights" refers to these moments of clarity or discovery, which the man believes he is able to achieve when he is alone with his thoughts. The other options don't fit as well with the context of the sentence - anxiety and happiness are emotions, while wisdom and inspiration are more abstract concepts that don't necessarily relate to the act of sitting alone.
better grades | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to academic performance. Studying is a commonly recognized method for students to improve their understanding of academic subjects and to perform better on exams, resulting in better grades. While studying can also increase knowledge and inspiration, these options are not the most immediate and direct results of studying. Money and higher intelligence are not mentioned in the context of the sentence.
flashlight | Knowledge: A portable light source is a device that can be moved around easily and used to illuminate dark areas or spaces. The most common portable light source is a flashlight or torch, which is a small handheld device that emits a beam of light when switched on. The other options listed, such as books, house, falling down, and hallway, do not have any obvious connection to the concept of a portable light source.
disinclination | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is quick to adapt to challenges but struggles specifically in relationships. The word "alacrity" means eagerness and enthusiasm, which contrasts with the negative connotations of the options listed. "Disinclination" means a lack of willingness or desire to do something, which fits with the context of struggling in relationships. The other options all suggest a lack of enthusiasm or interest in general, which is not specific enough to relationships.
knife | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a sharp blade is necessary to cut through something, which is a characteristic commonly associated with knives. Knives are commonly used for cutting all kinds of food, which could be what the sentence is referring to. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feeling better and feeling stronger | Knowledge: Getting in shape typically involves regular exercise and healthier lifestyle choices, both of which can lead to increased energy levels, improved mood, and stronger muscles. Feeling better and feeling stronger are commonly reported benefits of regular exercise and physical activity. Feeling depressed and experiencing pain are much less likely outcomes of getting in shape. Looking better may also be a factor, but it is not necessarily the primary goal or outcome of improving one's physical fitness.
better communication | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Teddy enjoyed learning languages, which implies that he saw some benefit to doing so. Many people learn new languages in order to better communicate with others from different countries or cultures, as it can be very helpful for travel, work, and personal relationships. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
number 1 | Knowledge: The phrase "right-hand man" is commonly used to describe someone's closest and most trusted assistant or partner. The term "number 1" is often used in a similar context to refer to someone who is considered the primary or most important individual. The other choices do not relate to the concept of a trusted assistant or partner in any way.
humane society | Knowledge: The phrase "wonderful place" suggests that the answer should be a location that is desirable or high-quality. The options "comfortable chair," "floor," and "window sill" are not locations where a person would typically go to get a cat. While Walmart does sell pet supplies, it is not typically considered a place to acquire an animal. The Humane Society, on the other hand, is a reputable organization that is dedicated to finding loving homes for animals in need, making it a logical choice for someone looking to adopt a cat.
lung disease | Knowledge: Smoking is widely known to have detrimental effects on one's health, particularly on the respiratory system. One of the most common and severe consequences of smoking is lung disease, which can manifest in various forms such as COPD and lung cancer. The other options are not necessarily negative consequences of smoking, but rather potential perceived benefits or neutral outcomes.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the non slip mat was designed to be used in a place where there is water, as it is meant to collect it. Bathrooms are typically the only room in a household with water sources, such as sinks or showers, making it the most likely place to use a non slip mat that is designed to collect water. The other options do not mention any connection to water or potential uses for a non slip mat.
building | Knowledge: The word "building" suggests a structure that contains multiple rooms or spaces, which typically have doors. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of doors. A wall, for example, may or may not have any doors built into it. A hardware store may sell doors, but it is not a location where multiple doors are found in one place. An apartment or office may have multiple doors, but neither term specifically implies the presence of more than one door.
curiosity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was inspired to explore more after seeing old things, which indicates a sense of curiosity. The other options, such as painful memories or new memories, do not align with the context of the sentence. "Reverence" and "remind" may have some connection to old things, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that they are the correct answer choices.
conservatory | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the ficus tree is not originally from the state known for actors and surfers (presumably California) but can be found somewhere else. The option "conservatory" makes the most sense since it is a place where trees from different regions or climates are kept and maintained. The other options are either too obvious (front yard or farm) or too broad (tropical forest), making them less logical choices.
pain and suffering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when love is not reciprocated, negative emotions are involved. Pain and suffering are common reactions to unrequited love, as it can cause feelings of rejection, heartbreak, and loss. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not directly relate to unrequited love and its emotional impact.
own home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are most comfortable somewhere, and one of the options is "own home". It is a common belief that people feel most comfortable and at ease in their own homes where they have control over their environment and can relax without feeling the need to be on guard or cautious. The other options do not have as clear a connection to the context of the sentence, and spending time or talking to other people can vary in comfort levels depending on the situation.
accomplish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual is sharing the tasks they have completed with many people, which implies a sense of achievement or accomplishment. Bragging implies an excessive sense of pride or boastfulness, which may not be the case. Annoyance, religion, and learn about do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city or town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy owned a physical store in the Midwest that sold high-quality clothing. The options "strip mall" and "shopping mall" both suggest a more commercial or lower-end location, which may not be appropriate for a store that sells high-end clothing. "Heaven" is illogical and clearly not meant as a serious answer. Therefore, the most reasonable option is "city or town," which suggests a more upscale, boutique-style store location. Ohio may or may not be the correct answer, as the sentence does not provide enough information to determine Billy's specific location.
fish tank | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fish remained in the water that was transferred, which implies that they were not released into a natural body of water like a reflecting pool or the surface of the earth. The sewage treatment plant is also an unlikely choice as it is not a typical destination for live aquatic life. Therefore, the most logical place for the fish to end up would be in a fish tank where they could continue to live in a controlled environment.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pennies will be used soon, which implies that they are needed for everyday expenses. Therefore, the most convenient place to put them would be in a pocket, where they can easily be accessed when needed. The other options (jar, water fountain, drawer, trunk) are not practical or logical places to store pennies for daily use.
lie down | Knowledge: The context suggests that the cats are experiencing sunlight, which may make them feel relaxed and comfortable. The action that most cats would likely take in this scenario is to lie down and bask in the warmth of the sunlight. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jail | Knowledge: Petty crimes are small offenses that typically carry a relatively light punishment, such as a fine or brief incarceration. Jails are typically used for shorter-term confinement of individuals who have been charged with or convicted of a crime, while prisons are typically used for longer-term confinement of more serious offenders. The other options are unlikely to be places where someone convicted of a crime would spend time, with options such as selling or offering drugs being illegal activities themselves. Nightclubs are entertainment venues and are not typically associated with punishment or correctional facilities.
fulfilled | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person achieved their goals through hard work, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. A headache and disappointment would imply negative emotions, while celebrated and simplicity do not necessarily relate to the concept of achieving goals through hard work.
insight | Knowledge: The genre of documentary filmmaking is often associated with presenting a factual and informative perspective on a given subject. Viewers of documentaries are typically seeking to gain a deeper understanding or insight into a topic that interests them. While documentaries may evoke emotions such as fear or provide entertainment value, these factors are typically not the primary reason why someone seeks out a documentary. Similarly, while documentaries may increase awareness of certain issues, this is often a secondary goal to the primary objective of cultivating greater understanding and insight.
fly | Knowledge: Geese are known to migrate in flocks through the air, so if they are invading a secure installation, it is likely that they will be spotted first in the air as they fly in. The option "group together" could be a possible answer as well, but it is not as specific as "fly." The other options, such as "guard house" and "ground," are not directly related to geese invasion and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
wallet | Knowledge: A credit card is typically kept in a wallet, which is a small flat case that is used for carrying cash, cards, and other small personal items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question, as they are either locations (envelope) or unrelated words (resturant, wakket). The word "purse" may be confusing, as it is also used to refer to a larger bag that women carry, but in this context, it does not make sense as a place to keep a credit card.
provide shelter | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Robinson was stranded and needed some form of shelter, and that he relied on something or someone to provide it. The phrase "huge tree" implies that the tree was large enough to provide some form of shelter. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not offer a plausible solution for Robinson's need for shelter.
loss of heat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lance had a temper, but was actively trying to improve by removing himself from a situation to calm down. The phrase "cooling off" implies that Lance's body temperature was elevated due to his anger, so he did not need a "loss of heat." The other options (expansion, relaxation, soap, and revenge) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
productive | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite the person's outward appearance of laziness, they possessed a strong imagination. A productive imagination would make sense here, as it implies that the person is actively creating and generating ideas, despite their perceived laziness. The other options either do not match the context of the sentence or do not offer a viable alternative to a productive imagination.
cafe | Knowledge: The word "cafe" refers to a place where people can have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question - movies are a form of entertainment, Idaho is a state, universities are educational institutions, and the universe is everything that exists.
prepare | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is reluctant to eat vegetables, and specifically mentions baked potatoes. In this context, "prepare" makes the most sense as an answer, as it implies that the person doesn't know how to cook or season vegetables properly. "Clean" and "wash" are unlikely answers, as potatoes are typically cleaned and washed before baking. "Grow" is also unlikely, as the person's reluctance to eat vegetables suggests that they are not interested in gardening. "Open mouth" is a non-sequitur and is clearly not a viable answer.
county | Knowledge: A courthouse is typically a government building where legal proceedings take place, such as trials or hearings. The purpose of a courthouse is to administer justice and enforce the law. As such, the city where a courthouse is located is often considered the seat of government for the county in which it resides. Therefore, the correct answer is county. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
millions of cells | Knowledge: Plants, like all living things, are composed of cells. It is through these cells that they perform their various functions such as photosynthesis, respiration, and growth. The other options describe different parts of a plant and their functions, but do not directly answer the question of what plants are made of.
roof | Knowledge: Bugs are typically found in natural environments such as fields, meadows, and gardens, as well as in areas with organic matter such as garbage cans. Roofs are not typically a habitat for bugs, as they are typically dry and do not provide access to food or shelter for most insects.
sky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bird is flying upwards, which typically means it is soaring through the air. The most logical option for where the bird would be flying in this context is the sky. The other options, such as mountain or forest, do not make sense in relation to flight. Similarly, nest and roof are both objects that the bird may land on, but they are not locations for flight.
getting cold | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that skiing without warm clothes can lead to a specific consequence, and "getting cold" is the most logical choice as it directly relates to the situation. "Fall down" and "accident" are not related to the lack of warm clothes, while "hunger" is also unlikely in this context. "Get cold" and "getting cold" are both grammatically correct, but "getting cold" may be a more appropriate choice as it matches the present continuous tense of "you're skiing."
cabinet | Knowledge: The question is asking where someone might keep personal soap, suggesting that the answer will be a location where an individual has control over their belongings. The options "birthday party" and "supermarket" are unlikely places to keep personal soap as they are public spaces. "Jail" is a possible place where someone might keep personal soap, but it is unlikely as personal belongings are limited in such an environment. Therefore, the most logical answer is "own home" or a "cabinet" within the home, as this is a place where people commonly store their personal items.
office block | Knowledge: The words "clerks" and "businesses" suggest a commercial setting, which is often found in an office block. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
None of the choices are appropriate. | Knowledge: The options do not relate to the given context of a person wanting a seafood dinner. It is important to carefully read and understand the context before choosing an answer. In this case, we can infer that the person likely went to a seafood restaurant or prepared a seafood meal at home based on their desire for a seafood dinner.
high school band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teenager is playing a trumpet, which is a common instrument used in marching bands and concert bands. These types of bands are often associated with high schools and colleges, making high school band the most likely choice. Orchestra and music shop/music store do not fit the context of a teenager playing a trumpet, and rock groups typically do not use trumpets as a primary instrument.
house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lantern is not available for purchase, meaning it is likely owned by someone. The most likely place for someone to have a lantern is in their house, as it can be used for power outages or outdoor activities like camping. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence - an antique shop might have a lantern for sale, a trashcan is not a suitable place for a lantern, and a dark place doesn't provide any clue as to where the lantern might be.
car crash | Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason that would cause someone to stop driving a car. While there are various reasons why someone might stop driving, a car crash is the most clear and abrupt reason. The other options are not necessarily reasons to stop driving, as someone could continue driving while feeling bored, sleepy, or moving to a new location.
bass guitar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a skill in playing the bass, which likely refers to the bass guitar as that is a common instrument that is "strung". The other choices, such as music shop, marching band, write music, and orchestra, do not seem related to the idea of "stringing" an instrument.
swimming pool | Knowledge: Chlorinated dihydrogen monoxide refers to water that has been treated with chlorine, which is a common practice in swimming pools to keep them clean and safe for use. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
misrepresent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker wants an honest real estate agent, and the phrase "last thing you want" implies a negative outcome. "Misrepresent" means to give a false or misleading impression of something, which would be the opposite of what the speaker is looking for. The other choices all involve some level of deception or dishonesty, which is not desirable when working with a real estate agent.
resort | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the vacation price includes hotel and meals, which implies that the location chosen is likely a resort or package deal that includes these amenities. Las Vegas and other metropolitan areas may offer hotels and meals separately, but they are not typically associated with resort-style vacation packages. The other choices also do not have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
relief | Knowledge: The word "assistance" implies that someone is receiving help or support in a time of need or difficulty. Therefore, the most likely benefit of receiving assistance would be relief from whatever challenge or problem the person was facing. The other options, while potentially positive outcomes of receiving assistance, do not capture the immediate and primary benefit that someone would feel in the moment of receiving help.
bank | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the revolving door in question had an emergency security lock because of the presence of large amounts of money. This is a common feature in banks, where significant sums of money are typically stored and exchanged. The other options may also have revolving doors, but they don't necessarily relate to the context of the sentence, or to the need for an emergency lock.
weak | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a person who needs to rest often may not have enough energy or strength to carry out their activities without feeling tired. This may indicate weakness or fatigue. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
farmer's market | Knowledge: The word "fresh" suggests that the green beans are recently harvested and have not been stored for long periods of time. Typically, green beans are not grown in a person's mouth or on a plate. They are often grown in fields, but the mention of freshness implies that they have not yet been picked. Containers may be used for storage or transportation, but they do not necessarily guarantee freshness. Farmer's markets are known for selling locally grown produce that is fresh and in season, making it a likely option for finding the freshest green beans.
west | Knowledge: Nevada is a landlocked state in the western United States, meaning it does not have direct access to any ocean. However, the Pacific Ocean is located to the west of the state. Therefore, "west" is the correct answer. The other options do not provide a direction to the Pacific Ocean.
fast | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's bosses think he needs to speed up or become faster in order to improve his performance. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "reliable" suggests that John is not trustworthy, "hasty" and "rapid" suggest that he is moving too quickly, and "prompt" suggests that he is not punctual.
enjoying | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is okay while eating the hamburger, indicating that she is not experiencing any negative physical symptoms such as choking or nausea. Additionally, the phrase "she seemed to be okay" implies that Sarah is feeling good or satisfied with the hamburger, which supports the correct answer being "enjoying". The other options are unlikely given the context of the sentence.
increased understanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John enjoys learning about people's feelings, indicating that he has a strong interest in gaining insight into human behavior. Additionally, the phrase "gave him something" implies that John is deriving some sort of benefit from these interactions. "Increased understanding" aligns with both of these ideas, as it suggests that talking to people about their feelings could give John a deeper understanding of human emotions and behavior. The other options do not align with the positive tone of the sentence and are therefore unlikely answers.
cause pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the brothers were punching with anger, which implies that they were intentionally trying to cause harm to someone or something. The other answer options (to defend themselves, broken bones, bruise, pain for) do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not explain why the brothers were punching angrily.
high school cafeteria | Knowledge: The question specifies that it is asking about the size of a school cafeteria, which implies that the correct answer must be related to a school. The option "high school" is specific to a certain type of school, which suggests that it may be the correct answer. The other options do not provide any information about the type or size of the cafeteria.
gas | Knowledge: Cabbage and broccoli are cruciferous vegetables that are known to cause gas in some people due to their high fiber content. The sentence suggests that the person was experiencing discomfort as a result of their diet, which is consistent with the symptoms of gas. The other options may be potential consequences of overeating, but they are not specifically related to the consumption of cabbage and broccoli as mentioned in the sentence.
theatre | Knowledge: A balcony is typically found in a theatre, where it is an elevated platform that offers a better view of the stage. In a hotel, a balcony is usually attached to a room and overlooks a courtyard or surrounding landscape, but it would not be used to watch a show. A movie house typically has stadium-style seating instead of a balcony. New Orleans and courtyard are not relevant to the question.
cool off | Knowledge: Heatstroke is a serious medical condition that requires immediate action to prevent further damage to the body. The most effective way to treat heatstroke is to cool off the body as quickly as possible. This can involve moving to a cooler environment, removing excess clothing, and applying cool water to the skin. The other options, such as building a snowman or eating ice cream, may provide temporary relief but will not effectively treat the underlying condition. Swimming may also be dangerous if the person is experiencing heatstroke and unable to properly regulate their body temperature.
shelf | Knowledge: The sentence indicated that John picked up the pencil and put it back where it was, which suggests that the pencil had a designated place to be stored. Out of the choices given, the only option that implies a storage location is "shelf." The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a high number of apartments available, indicating that it is likely a densely populated area such as a town or city. The other options (Michigan and Texas) are specific states and do not give any indication of the location being referred to. "Budget" is not a place, and "avoid buying" is not a location at all.
allergies | Knowledge: The fact that Jane started sneezing after using a cleaning agent suggests that she may be experiencing an allergic reaction to the product. Sneezing is a common symptom of allergies, especially when it comes to airborne particles like dust or fumes from cleaning agents. Pain and suffering, fever, and boredom do not fit the context of the sentence and cleanliness, while related to housework, does not relate to the symptoms Jane is experiencing.
connect  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the telephone is used to connect people, which is a common knowledge fact. The other choices are antonyms of the word "connect" and do not fit with the context of the sentence.
chicken coop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel is in a confined space, likely due to the curse of the witch. A chicken coop is a small enclosed area where chickens are kept, making it a plausible location for the weasel to be stuck in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
experience pain | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a characteristic that distinguishes a person from a stuffed dummy, implying that the dummy cannot experience pain, while a person can. Pain is a sensory experience that is unique to living beings, and therefore it is the only option that separates a person from a stuffed dummy. The other options either do not relate to the ability to experience pain or are not exclusive to living beings.
organization | Knowledge: The term "business leader" suggests that the person is in a position of authority within a company or organization. Therefore, they would be responsible for managing the organization and its employees, making decisions about budgets and strategy, and setting goals and objectives. The other options, such as army, country, micromanagement, and pack, do not have any connection to the context of a business leader.
dressing room | Knowledge: When shopping for clothes at a store, customers typically use a dressing room to try on the clothes and check themselves out in a mirror. A dressing room provides privacy for customers to change in and out of clothing and allows them to see how the clothes fit and look on their body. The other options, such as a bedroom, hotel, fun house, or house, may have mirrors but they are not typically used for trying on clothes in a retail setting.
It depends on the context of the sentence or question. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the correct answer.
alcatraz | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "prison movies," which implies that the correct answer is a well-known prison that has been featured in popular culture. Alcatraz is a well-known prison located in San Francisco Bay that has been the setting for several well-known movies and TV shows, including "Escape From Alcatraz" and "The Rock." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tree | Knowledge: Wood comes from trees, so it is logical to assume that the best place to get fresh wood is from a tree. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A boat is made of wood, but it is unlikely that one would go to a boat to get fresh wood. A hardware store may sell wood, but it may not be fresh. One's own home may have some wood, but it is unlikely to be fresh, and the question is asking for a place to get fresh wood. The jungle may have trees, but it is not a practical answer for most people.
horseradish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was eating a roast beef sandwich and spilled a spicy sauce on it. Horseradish is a common condiment used with roast beef, and is known for its spicy flavor. The other options, such as Texas or a guest room, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
texas | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "Everything is bigger" is often associated with Texas and its culture. Additionally, the mention of a "steak house" also supports the idea that Texas is the correct answer, as the state has a reputation for its love of steak and BBQ. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
forbidden | Knowledge: The sentence states that Bill would not allow Sam to build a new addition, which means that Sam was not permitted to do so. Sam's protest would suggest that he believed he had the right to build the addition, but Bill had explicitly forbidden him from doing so. Forbidden is the correct choice as it accurately reflects the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest that the construction was either already in place or that Bill was being too strict in his management of the property.
afternoon | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are two different groups of people who have different energy levels at different times of day. The phrase "after lunch" suggests that the second group of people doesn't really get going until the afternoon. The other options are either too early (morning) or too late (nighttime and dusk) to fit the context.
let himself go | Knowledge: The phrase "letting oneself go" often refers to a person neglecting their physical appearance, hygiene, or other aspects of their life due to being in a comfortable and committed relationship. This can include things like gaining weight or not prioritizing self-care as much. The other options do not make sense in the context of being in a relationship.
restaurant | Knowledge: The fact that Bobby noticed that the silverware was plastic suggests that he was dining out at a restaurant. If he were at home, he likely would have known beforehand whether the silverware was plastic or not. The other options, such as silver and cupboard, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
terrarium | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James is an animal that is being kept in captivity. The fact that he is surrounded by children and separated from the outside world by glass suggests that he is being kept in a controlled environment, like a terrarium. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - a weasel would not typically be found in a law firm or a classroom, and a forest is not a controlled environment. A zoo might be a possibility but terrarium is a more specific and likely option given the details provided.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that giving assistance to family members in need can elicit an emotional response, and it is up to the reader to determine what that response might be. Since the other options are generally negative (death, sadness) or more neutral (pleasure, reward), satisfaction stands out as the most likely answer. Helping others, especially family members, can be a rewarding experience that often leads to feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment.
field | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people were drinking outside and littering, specifically throwing bottles on the ground. A field would be a logical place for this to occur, as it is an open space that people may go to for recreational activities. The other options may also be places where littering occurs, but the mention of broken glass suggests a larger and potentially more dangerous amount of litter than would be found in a typical trash can or recycling bin.
toxic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the accumulation of mercury in certain fish can have negative effects. The word "toxic" specifically refers to the poisonous nature of mercury and its ability to cause harm to living organisms. The other options do not accurately describe the effects of mercury buildup in fish. "Uninhabitable" and "barren and airless" describe physical environments, not the effects of a substance on living organisms. "Poisonous" is a synonym for toxic and is also a correct answer. "Obesity" is not related to the topic of the sentence.
headaches | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam is receiving something that he does not want, and headaches are often seen as a negative experience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as satisfaction, being happy, and money are generally viewed as positive things, while "then have" is nonsensical in this context.
mouse trap | Knowledge: A mouse trap is designed to trap and kill mice, which are attracted to cheese. Therefore, cheese would be dangerous for mice in a mouse trap. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
loud noises | Knowledge: The question suggests that playing violin may result in a negative outcome, which can be inferred from the fact that someone is trying to stop it from happening. One reason for this could be that the violin is producing loud noises that may disturb other people nearby. Of the options given, only "loud noises" is directly related to this context, while the others do not provide a clear explanation for why someone would want to stop someone else from playing the violin.
children's song | Knowledge: The term "human weasel" is not a common descriptor for any specific group of people. However, the fact that it is mentioned in relation to a children's song suggests that it may be a character or concept from that context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
prosecution | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group mentioned was responsible for explaining why the defendant was guilty of obstructing justice. This is consistent with the role of the prosecution in a criminal trial, which is to present evidence and arguments in support of a guilty verdict. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
linen closet | Knowledge: A washcloth is a commonly kept item in a linen closet, along with towels and other linens for personal hygiene and household use. Bathing and using the bathroom sink may involve using a washcloth, but do not necessarily guarantee that one will be available if you do not have one. The garage and Walmart are not typically places where one would store or obtain a washcloth.
welcome guests | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the host of the party was stationed at the front door, which is typically where guests are welcomed into a home or venue. The other options do not make sense in this context: talking on a radio show, shutting the door, expecting company, and sitting at the head table are all unrelated to welcoming guests at a party.
gas station | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was lost and needed a map, which implies that they were traveling by car or some form of transportation. Gas stations are often convenient places to stop for maps and directions, as well as fuel and snacks. The other options (backpack, amusement park, taco shop) do not have any clear connection to the situation described in the sentence. A truck stop might be a plausible option, but it is less likely to have maps and directions available to non-commercial drivers.
crucial | Knowledge: The sentence implies that light is necessary or important when trying to read. Reading typically requires visual clarity, which is provided by sufficient lighting. Therefore, a lack of light, or inadequate lighting conditions, could impede or hinder reading ability. The other options, such as "heavy" or "cumbersome," do not make sense in the context of reading and therefore can be eliminated.
deadly | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that driving drunk is not only stupid but also has serious consequences. The word "even" implies that the consequence can be worse than just causing damage or being dangerous. The word "deadly" means causing or capable of causing death, which fits the severity of the situation described in the sentence. The other options are not appropriate because they do not reflect the seriousness of the situation.
oven | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bread was being baked, as the sourdough starter was rising inside "where." This "where" is likely the oven, as that is where bread is typically baked. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - the bread pan is where the dough is typically formed, yeast is an ingredient used to make bread rise, flour is an ingredient used to make dough, and "to the top" does not make sense in this context.
move away from | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the new worker was obstructing the work area and potentially endangering themselves with the dangerous equipment. The phrase "standing in the way" implies that the foreman wants the worker to move out of the path of the equipment. The phrase "move away from" indicates the same meaning as "step out of" but is a more common phrase to use in this context. The other options do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
anticipation or excitement | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time is an exciting or anticipated event. The options "cheer" and "talk" do not accurately capture the emotion being described, while "joy" may be an appropriate response but doesn't quite capture the sense of anticipation or excitement.
own factory | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the company is able to keep manufacturing costs low, which suggests that they have control over the production process. Using slave labor would likely result in legal and ethical issues, and liquidating the company would not reduce manufacturing costs. Paying employees and mailing clients are not relevant to the manufacturing process. Therefore, the answer is likely that the company has its own factory, which allows it to control production and keep costs low.
ask  | Knowledge: The word "confirm" means to verify or corroborate information that is already known or believed to be true. In order to confirm information, you would need to ask for clarification or verification from someone who has knowledge of the subject. The other options do not make sense in the context of confirming information.
cover | Knowledge: The word "bounds" implies that something is enclosing or holding together the book. Out of the choices given, only "cover" can fulfill that description. Staples could be used to hold together the pages, but it does not enclose the entire book. "At least a few pages" and "many words" describe the contents of the book, but do not refer to what physically binds it together.
fatigue | Knowledge: The sentence implies that listening to a boring talk for a long time can lead to a feeling of exhaustion or weariness, which is commonly associated with fatigue. The other options are not typically associated with the experience of listening to a boring talk.
stall | Knowledge: When an airplane stalls, it means that there isn't enough air flowing over the wings to produce lift, and so the plane begins to lose altitude. Stalling can sometimes lead to a crash, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the plane will crash - the pilot can take corrective action to recover from the stall and regain altitude. The other options imply either a less severe issue (like slowing down or halting) or a more severe one (like crashing or coming to a sudden stop).
different | Knowledge: The phrase "melting pot" is often used to describe the cultural diversity of America, where people of different ethnicities and backgrounds come together and blend into a unified whole. The word "different" is the only choice that accurately describes the diverse nature of America's population. The other options are either too subjective or have no connection to the concept of cultural diversity.
more energy than walking | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a difference between running in the Olympics and running outside. This difference can be inferred from the fact that the question asks what is needed for the former that is not needed for the latter. The options "legs," "agility," "movement" and "speed" are all essential for both types of running, so they are not the correct answer. However, the option "more energy than walking" is specific to running in the Olympics, as it requires a higher level of endurance and stamina than everyday running.
vein | Knowledge: Veins are blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart, while arteries carry blood away from the heart. The question specifically asks for something that carries blood toward the heart, which eliminates the options of pumps (which are devices that may aid in circulation but do not carry blood themselves), hospitals and soccer games (which are not related to the circulatory system), and people (who may have veins but are not themselves a means of transporting blood).
crumbs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kids were eating crackers while playing on the floor, which likely resulted in crumbs being scattered across the surface. The mother then had to vacuum up these crumbs in order to clean the floor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
lamp | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants more light sources while they are awake at night, which implies that they are likely indoors. The most logical option for adding more light indoors would be to install a lamp. The other options do not make sense in the context of wanting more light while being indoors at night (sky) or are impractical (digging in the garden) or not as bright or safe (candle).
coffee | Knowledge: The sentence implies that beans are being turned into a beverage. One common beverage made from beans is coffee, which is made by brewing coffee beans. The other options either do not involve beans or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
friend's house | Knowledge: The word "usually" suggests that the answer is a common occurrence. While there may be more than one telephone in the other options listed, it is most common to have multiple phones in a friend's house. Additionally, desktops and phone booths typically only have one phone, hospitals usually have phones in patient rooms but not in common areas, and parties may have only one phone or none at all.
wet clothes | Knowledge: The question is asking about the outcome of someone wading while fishing, which suggests that the person will be standing in water while trying to catch fish. Therefore, it is likely that they will get wet as a result of the activity. The other options do not make sense in this context - happiness and anger are emotions that may be associated with fishing, but not specifically with wading while fishing. Getting drunk may be a possible outcome of drinking while fishing, but not necessarily related to wading in particular. Catching fish is the goal of fishing, but this option does not provide information on what happens to the person wading.
stairwell | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location where residents socialized, played dice, and smoked is a public and busy area. An airport, ocean, and casino do not fit this description as they are typically regulated or have restricted access. An apartment building, while it may have public areas, is unlikely to have such a busy landing. A stairwell, on the other hand, is a common location for socialization in some communities and can be a high traffic area within a building.
not feel pain | Knowledge: Taking drugs can sometimes numb or dull physical or emotional pain, making it a possible reason why a person would take drugs. This is because drugs can alter the brain's chemistry, leading to a temporary relief of physical or emotional discomfort. The other options do not have a clear connection to the act of taking drugs.
movie | Knowledge: The word "screen" implies a visual presentation, which is commonly associated with movies. While some of the other options such as theatre, show, and comedy may also be presented on a screen, they are not as commonly associated with the word "entertainment." A casino, on the other hand, typically does not involve a screen but rather physical games and activities.
coffee shop | Knowledge: The sentence relates to the act of ordering a cup of coffee, which is commonly associated with coffee shops. While coffee can be consumed in many different places, it is most commonly ordered and prepared in a café or coffee shop. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fairgrounds | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cows were being judged in a competitive setting, which typically takes place at agricultural fairs or exhibitions. Fairgrounds are commonly used for showcasing livestock competitions, including cows. The other options are possible locations for cows, but do not provide any indication that they are being judged or evaluated.
dishwasher | Knowledge: The question is asking about what to do with a spoon after finishing eating. Since the other choices are all related to eating or serving food, it can be inferred that the spoon is also related to eating. The most likely place to put a spoon after eating is in a dishwasher, where it can be cleaned along with other dishes and utensils. The other options, such as a bowl of soup or serving dish, would require the spoon to be used again, whereas the washing machine and dinner are not related to eating or cleaning dishes.
tiredness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that performing physical tasks can lead to a certain outcome, and the other options do not fit that context. Injury is a possibility but is not as general as the overall meaning of the sentence. Doing your best and getting accolades are not necessarily tied to physical tasks, and "friend" seems out of place in this sentence. Therefore, tiredness is the most appropriate answer, as it is a common result of performing physical tasks.
burrow | Knowledge: Foxes are known to create underground dens or burrows in order to hide from predators or harsh weather conditions. This behavior is commonly associated with foxes, making the option "burrow" the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gaining weight | Knowledge: The question suggests that eating and not exercising can lead to negative consequences, specifically mentioning problems. Gaining weight is a well-known issue that can result from a lack of exercise and overeating. The other options either do not relate to the negative consequences of eating and not exercising or are synonymous with the act of eating.
old | Knowledge: The use of black and white photography is less common in modern times, and is often associated with the past. Additionally, the use of "look" in the sentence suggests that the photograph is being viewed in the present, which would indicate that it is not a recent image. The other options, while also implying a sense of time, do not necessarily suggest an association with black and white photography or a non-recent image.
books | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the stories about a talking beaver can be enjoyed by children, which implies that they are likely written in a format that is accessible to children. Books are a common medium for children's stories, and the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that the talking beaver lives in a wooded area or body of water is not relevant to the medium in which the stories are presented.
detachment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is planning to stop being married, which implies a sense of emotional distance or detachment from their spouse. The other options (bankruptcy, sad, fights, wrong) do not necessarily capture this sense of emotional detachment and, while they could be relevant in certain contexts, do not seem to fit the specific context of the sentence.
museum | Knowledge: Old pictures are usually considered valuable and are often preserved in places like museums. Trunks, suitcases, and attics are all places where people might keep personal belongings, but they are not commonly associated with the preservation of historical artifacts like old pictures. It is also unlikely that someone would keep old pictures in a fridge.
antarctica | Knowledge: The sentence mentions ice, which suggests that the correct answer must be related to a place where ice is present. Antarctica is known for its icy terrain, making it a likely option. Mixed drinks, the refrigerator, water coolers, and hockey games do not have any clear connection to the concept of ice in the context of the sentence.
attic  | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that John found old stuff while cleaning out the house, and specifically mentions that there was nothing upstairs, suggesting that the old stuff was found in a place other than the upstairs area. The options "loft," "cellar," and "waste bin" are unlikely to contain old items, and "museum" doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely "attic," a common storage space in many homes where people often keep old items.
pocket | Knowledge: Dollar bills are typically carried in pockets, as they are small enough to fit comfortably in a pants or jacket pocket. Wallets and purses are also common places to carry money, but the question specifies "a man," which suggests a preference for carrying money in a more practical and accessible manner. A bank or car would not be appropriate choices for carrying just one dollar bill.
backpack | Knowledge: The question is asking about a specific use case for a blanket, which is to cover a horse. Horses are typically found in outdoor settings, such as farms, ranches, or in transportation. Therefore, the option that best fits the intended use case is backpack, as a blanket may be useful for covering a horse during transport in a backpack-style carrier. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
eat well | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercise is important for a person's health, but it is not the only factor. The phrase "and what?" implies that there is another important factor to consider. Eating well is commonly associated with good health, as a balanced and nutritious diet can help maintain physical and mental well-being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some (such as drinking lots of soda) may actually be harmful to one's health.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that garbage waste is being poured out onto the road, which means it will likely wash away with rain or other forms of water runoff. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve the disposal of garbage waste on a road.
town | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a place that is a middle ground between a country, which is a large geographical area, and a city, which is a smaller, more densely populated area. A town is a type of urban area that is smaller than a city but larger than a village or rural area. France and continent are too large to be the answer, state refers to a subdivision of a country and is too broad of an answer, and metal is not related to geography or place size.
bombastic, loquacious, verbose, talkative, prolix | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the professor spoke in a reserved, conservative, and laconic tone, meaning that he probably used short, simple, and precise language. The answer choices are all related to the opposite of this, meaning that the professor was likely avoiding bombastic, loquacious, verbose, talkative, and prolix language (which all mean using excessive or unnecessary words or being overly talkative).
bleeding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe stabbed a man, but did not intend to do so. Consequently, he is scared of the potential consequences, indicating that he understands the severity of his actions. The collapsed state of the man indicates that he was severely injured, likely with knife wounds. This would cause the man to bleed, making bleeding the correct choice. The other options, such as knives or law suit, do not fit the context of the sentence.
kitchen cabinet | Knowledge: A frying pan is a cooking utensil and is typically stored in the kitchen. The context of the question implies that the answer should be a location in the kitchen where a frying pan can be kept. The other options are not related to the context of the question, as a galley is a type of ship kitchen, department store is a place where items are sold, closet is not typically found in kitchens, and homes is too broad and does not specify a location.
guy | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the child and her brother had different preferences in terms of the movie's characters. The word "lady" suggests a female character, while the option "guy" refers to a male character, which makes it the most likely answer. The other options are less likely as they do not have a clear gender association, or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
burn themselves | Knowledge: This question is asking for a factually correct answer about the physical consequences of touching a hot stove. When a person touches a hot stove, they can sustain burns from the heat. This knowledge is based on scientific principles of thermodynamics and the properties of heat. The other options are irrelevant or inaccurate in this context.
get somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to a mode of transportation when one does not have a car. The options "go home" and "get drunk" are not related to transportation, so they can be eliminated. The options "commute" and "avoid parking hassle" suggest a regular, planned trip, while the option "get somewhere" is more general and could refer to any destination. Therefore, "get somewhere" is the correct answer.
operating room | Knowledge: Medical instruments are primarily used in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and clinics. The operating room is a specific area within a healthcare facility where surgical procedures are performed, making it the most likely option in the given choices. The other options have no apparent connection to the context of medical instruments.
stadium | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a "scoreboard" and suggests that the place is used for playing an "indoor sport." A scoreboard is typically found in a stadium where sports events are held. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shelf is meant for storing perishable items that require cold temperatures, which implies that it must be located inside a refrigerator. Cupboards and bookstores are not generally associated with keeping things cold, while corners and Antarctica are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Spain | Knowledge: The phrase "árbol de manzana" is Spanish for "apple tree," therefore it can be assumed that the correct answer is Spain, where the Spanish language is spoken. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have cooked | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fish needs to be cooked in order to make a meal. "Hungry" and "wife asked to" do not provide any information on what type of food could be made with fish. "Sushi" is a specific dish that involves raw fish, and "lamb sauce" is not related to fish at all. Therefore, "have cooked" is the most appropriate answer that fits the context of the sentence.
water | Knowledge: Snakes are not great swimmers and are not likely to go into water if there are other options available. In general, snakes prefer dry areas with ample cover and a good supply of prey. Tropical forests, creeks, and underbrush are all typical habitats for snakes, while "outdoors" is not specific enough to provide any meaningful information.
gain knowledge | Knowledge: The question suggests that when people successfully learn a lesson, something specific happens as a result. The choices provided are all possible actions or outcomes, but only one directly relates to the act of learning a lesson - gaining knowledge. When people learn a lesson, it means they have acquired new information or understanding, which can be described as gaining knowledge. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
stationery store | Knowledge: The context suggests that the item being sold is related to writing or office supplies. The grocery store and martyr's chest are unlikely places to find writing instruments, while dek is an unfamiliar term that does not provide any context clues. The office supply store is a possibility, but the mention of letter openers as well as writing instruments strongly suggests that a stationery store is the most likely place to find both items.
contract | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the companies were already working well together, indicating a positive relationship between them. When companies have a good relationship, they may decide to extend their working contract or agreement to continue their partnership. Shorten, compress, and retract all suggest a reduction or termination of the working agreement, while "fur" does not make sense in this context.
exotic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Debbie wants a dress that is not plain or ordinary. The words "unusual and attention-getting" indicate that she wants something unique and possibly from a different cultural tradition. The word "exotic" means foreign or unusual, which fits with the description of the dress Debbie wants. The other options either do not fit with the character's desire for something special or have a negative connotation.
learn things  | Knowledge: Reading a book about a topic that you have little knowledge in can help you learn new information and increase your understanding of the topic. The other options are not necessarily guaranteed outcomes of reading a book on an unfamiliar topic.
listen to music | Knowledge: The friend's suggestion was to do something that would help the woman relax while her child was in a competition. Listening to music is a well-known way to decrease stress and anxiety, and can be particularly effective in situations where someone is feeling nervous or worried. The other options don't offer any clear solution to the woman's problem.
livingroom | Knowledge: Coffee tables are typically found in living rooms, where they serve as a central place for people to place drinks, snacks, and other items. While coffee tables could technically be found in any of the other rooms listed, there is no specific indication that they would be present in those contexts. Internet cafes, for example, might have tables for customers to use their laptops or devices, but these would not necessarily be referred to as "coffee tables." The other options similarly lack any clear connection to the presence of coffee tables.
soft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fur of a puppy has been cleaned through a bath, and it is asking how the fur feels after being cleaned. Generally, after bath fur feels soft, clean, and free from any dirt or dust. Shiny fur can also be possible, but it is not a guaranteed outcome of a bath. "One choice for pet," "cute," and "kennel" do not provide any relevant information about the state of the puppy's fur after taking a bath.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a wine cellar requires a consistently cool (temperature-controlled) and dark environment, which is commonly found in a basement. A basement is often the preferred location for a wine cellar as it provides the necessary conditions for storing wine. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the requirements of a wine cellar.
go outside | Knowledge: The phrase "hovered by the exit" suggests that the cats are waiting to leave a particular location, likely indoors. The phrase "go outside" is the only option that directly relates to this context and makes sense in the sentence. The other options either do not have a connection to the idea of leaving a location or are not supported by the context provided.
upright | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen in question had poor posture which implies that they did not stand up straight. "Upright" is the only choice that directly relates to standing in a straight posture, while the other options do not have a specific connection to the context of the sentence.
city center or large city | Knowledge: Delicatessens are typically popular in urban areas with diverse populations and a strong culinary culture. City centers and large cities are more likely to have a variety of food options, including specialty delis that cater to different communities and tastes. Malls and shops may have food courts or cafes, but they are less likely to feature a dedicated delicatessen. Michigan is a state and not a specific location, so it does not fit the question.
angry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the archaeologist was able to identify that the artifacts were fake, which implies that he knew what he was looking for and was an expert in his field. Since the artifacts were fake, it is likely that the archaeologist would feel angry or frustrated that someone was trying to deceive others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is nothing in the sentence to suggest that the archaeologist was feeling any of those emotions.
progress | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the construction manager was communicating with financiers, suggesting that he was updating them on the status of the building project. The word "briefing" suggests a report or update, rather than a discussion of ideas or collaboration. The option "bulldozer" is a machine used in construction, but it is not relevant to the sentence. The options "collaboration" and "exchanging ideas" suggest a more collaborative process, which is not consistent with the context of the sentence. The option "static" is also not relevant to the sentence.
post office or hardware store | Knowledge: Mailboxes are typically sold at hardware stores or can be obtained from the post office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
playfulness | Knowledge: The word "flirty" implies that the person is playful and perhaps teasing, rather than simply being good-looking or enjoying pleasure. While being good-looking may contribute to someone being perceived as flirty, it is not the defining characteristic. Similarly, owning a house or seeking new experiences do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
carnival | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity mentioned involves getting junk food and playing games, which is a common feature of carnivals. Carnivals are known for offering a variety of fun activities and indulgent treats like fried foods and sweets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
container | Knowledge: The sentence hints that a plastic item is used to store dairy, which can imply that the item needs to be lightweight, airtight, and made of a material that is safe for food storage. Out of the given choices, only a container satisfies all these requirements. A container can come in different shapes and sizes, making it a versatile option for storing different types of dairy (e.g., milk, yogurt, cheese). The other options (freezer, bucket, refrigerator, fridge) refer to either a location or an appliance rather than a specific plastic item.
rest area | Knowledge: Rest areas are typically found along highways or major roads and are specifically designed for drivers to take a break and use the restroom. Schools, hotels, and educational areas are not typically available to the general public for restroom use, and stopping at a friend's house would not be a practical option when traveling long distances.
sundown | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a group of people would undertake a specific action at night, and that the start of the action was signaled by a specific event. "Sundown" is a term used to refer to the time of day when the sun sets below the horizon, which would coincide with the arrival of nighttime. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
house | Knowledge: Based on the context of the sentence, it is clear that the answer must be something that is related to sleeping and breathing. The only option that makes sense in this context is "house" because it is a common location where people sleep and where air can be easily circulated through windows, doors, or ventilation systems. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical answer.
town | Knowledge: The word "quaint" suggests that the steak house was looking for a charming, old-fashioned location. A town can be a good fit for this description, as many small towns have historic buildings and a slower pace of life. The other options (New York, Mexico, United States) are either too general or not related to the context of the sentence. The option "library" does not make sense as a location for a steak house.
water fountain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is taking a sip of something she got from pressing a button on a handle. A water fountain would match this description, as it is a common feature in public places where one can press a button to dispense water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fear | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy didn't like going fast on a horse because it made him feel a certain way, which is likely a negative emotion. The option that best fits this context is fear, as going fast on a horse can be scary if one doesn't have experience with it. The other options, such as stiffness or blisters, are unlikely to be related to the feeling that Billy is experiencing.
lies | Knowledge: Perjury is the act of lying under oath, specifically in a court of law. The question suggests that someone committing perjury would potentially face jail time. The correct answer, "lies," is directly connected to the act of perjury as it involves giving false information while under oath. The other options, such as "testify," "speaking," "great anxiety," and "guilt," are not specifically related to the act of perjury and do not provide a clear connection to the question.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person does not have any coffee and needs to borrow some. The options include places where one would typically purchase coffee, such as a convenience store or supermarket, or where one might have a meeting or grab a quick bite to eat, such as a fast food restaurant. However, the most appropriate option is a friend's house, as borrowing from a friend is a common practice and aligns with the tone of the sentence.
aquarium | Knowledge: Fish typically live in bodies of water such as oceans, ponds, bays, and rivers. However, when kept as pets, fish are commonly kept in an enclosed tank called an aquarium. Therefore, the correct answer is aquarium.
dexterity | Knowledge: Fiddling with something implies manipulating it with one's hands, which requires a high level of dexterity or fine motor skills. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "dexterity". "Practice" and "skill" could be relevant, but not as specific as "dexterity". "Thief" and "knowledge of music" are not related to the context of the sentence.
car | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a family road trip where the person is sitting in the back seat and looking out of the window. The options that do not make sense include building, ocean, and computer screen, as they suggest a stationary environment instead of a moving one. While a bus could be an option, the sentence specifically mentions "family road trips," which suggests a personal or privately owned vehicle, like a car.
frustration | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that there is a negative aspect associated with working in an office. While being paid and making money are common reasons for wanting to work, the sentence implies that there is a specific reason why someone would not want to work in an office. Frustration is a common feeling associated with office work due to factors such as a lack of autonomy, a toxic work environment, or challenging tasks. Blisters and making shareholders richer do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
increased heart rate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the doctor advised the patient to start jogging in order to achieve a specific goal. One possible reason for this would be to increase the patient's heart rate, which is a common benefit of aerobic exercise like running. Increased heart rate can help to strengthen the heart and improve cardiovascular health. The other options are less likely to be the reason for the doctor's advice, and some may actually have negative consequences for the patient's health (e.g. knee pain).
make time | Knowledge: The question is asking for a solution to the problem of finding time to exercise. The options "exercise", "energy", and "go running" are not solutions to the problem, but rather related concepts. The option "just do" does not provide any actionable advice on how to make time for exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is "make time", as this option directly addresses the question and suggests finding ways to prioritize and schedule exercise into one's daily routine.
show | Knowledge: A movie is typically categorized as a form of entertainment that involves watching a pre-recorded narrative on a screen. This type of entertainment is commonly referred to as a "movie show," which explains why the correct answer is "show." The other options, such as "performance" and "sporting event," do not accurately describe the experience of watching a movie. A "demonstration" also does not fit the context, as it usually refers to an instructional or educational experience rather than entertainment.
go swimming | Knowledge: The word "fun" suggests that the activity would be enjoyable and recreational, and "go swimming" is a common leisure activity associated with having fun. The other options, such as "commit crimes" and "part company," have negative connotations and are not appropriate options for an activity related to having fun. "Hungry" is a state of being rather than an activity, and "believe in god" does not relate to a specific action for having fun.
emergency kit | Knowledge: A tourniquet is a device used to stop severe bleeding by applying pressure to the affected limb. It is typically used in emergency situations where the bleeding cannot be controlled by other means. While a doctor's office or hospital may have tourniquets available, they are not typically used in those settings unless there is a specific need. Ambulances may carry tourniquets, but they are not always on hand. Applying even pressure is a general technique that may aid in situations where there is some bleeding but not severe enough to require a tourniquet. Therefore, an emergency kit is the most likely place to find a tourniquet for temporary use.
drawer | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is about storing papers, which implies a need for organization and safekeeping. A drawer is a common storage solution for papers because it offers protection from dust, light, and potential damage. A table is not a storage solution and may not provide adequate protection for papers. A garage is not typically associated with paper storage and may be prone to moisture and temperature changes that can damage paper. Meeting and receipts are not relevant to the question.
vend | Knowledge: The word "food" suggests that the machine is likely to be a type of vending machine. Vending machines are commonly used to distribute snacks and drinks, and are often found in places like hospitals, schools, and office buildings where people may need quick access to food or refreshments. The other options do not relate to the concept of providing food, but instead suggest activities like building, cleaning, or delivering.
show | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if your plumbing system is broken, you would need to call a plumber to fix it. The other options do not have any clear connection to plumbing or fixing broken pipes. "Show" is the only option that suggests a possible action or solution to the problem of broken plumbing.
becoming full | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something will happen directly after eating, and the most logical option in this case is becoming full. When a person eats, their stomach fills up with food and they may feel full or satisfied. The other options do not accurately describe what happens right after eating or are irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
ashtray | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is no one around to hold the lit cigarette, which implies that it needs to be placed somewhere. An ashtray is a common object used to hold cigarettes and dispose of ash and butts. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
friend's house | Knowledge: The question implies that the person is looking for a new home for a piece of furniture that holds sentimental value. A pawn shop may not be the best option, as they typically specialize in buying and selling secondhand goods for profit. A rug is not an appropriate answer, as it is not related to furniture. Room and apartment are also not suitable, as they are not specific enough and do not provide any useful information. Therefore, the best choice would be a friend's house, as they may be willing to take the piece of furniture and offer it a new home.
enlightenment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe is a philosopher who listens to music in order to evoke certain mental states that help him in his work. The word "enlightenment" implies a deep understanding or insight, which is a common goal in many philosophical traditions. The other options don't have the same connotation of a profound or transformative experience.
residential area | Knowledge: The word "condo" is short for condominium, which is a type of housing unit that is part of a larger residential building or complex. Therefore, it is likely that a human would be entering a condo in a residential area where such buildings or complexes are located. The other options, such as suburbia, Milwaukee, New York, or a cruise ship, do not necessarily have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
paws | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog enjoys being petted on a specific part of its body, and the options "teeth," "four legs," and "two ears" are unlikely candidates. The option "the gas station ran out of gas today" is completely unrelated to the topic, leaving "paws" as the only logical choice. Additionally, many dogs enjoy having their paws rubbed or scratched, so this choice makes sense given the context of the sentence.
bedside table | Knowledge: This question refers to the use of a rubber, which is a slang term for a condom. Condoms are commonly kept in a bedside table as they are often used during sexual activities that take place in a bed. The other options, such as drug store or classroom, do not make sense in this context.
pass out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person became drunk and then laid down on a bench, indicating that they likely lost consciousness or became unconscious. "Pass out" is the most fitting choice because it describes the state of losing consciousness due to alcohol consumption. The other options, such as death and destruction or fall down, are too extreme or don't accurately reflect the situation presented in the sentence.
new york city | Knowledge: New York City is often referred to as the cultural capital of the United States, and it has a long history of theater productions. The city's Broadway district is particularly famous for its many theaters that host major productions throughout the year. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and there is no indication that they are known for theaters.
trigonometry | Knowledge: The sentence mentions John's lack of understanding of triangles, which is a key topic in trigonometry. Trigonometry deals with the study of triangles and their relationships to angles and sides. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are therefore incorrect.
bring rain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something is dropping from clouds on a warm day, which is likely referring to rain. The phrase "bring rain" also implies a connection to precipitation. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - boiling oil would not come from clouds, and "awe inspiring" and "move in" do not relate to the concept of rain.
anger | Knowledge: The question implies that going to work on an average day is likely to induce a negative emotion. Anger is a common response to perceived stressors such as traffic, difficult coworkers, or the stress of the job itself. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they do not capture the negative emotions that one might experience during a commute or work day.
get warm | Knowledge: Being cold typically implies discomfort or a feeling of discomfort associated with a lack of warmth. Therefore, the goal would likely be to alleviate that discomfort by getting warm. The other options are not relevant to the context of feeling cold.
None of the choices are correct. The sentence does not provide any context or explanation for why someone needs to be doing housework themselves.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is pointing their transistor radio upwards, which could indicate that they are trying to pick up transmissions from an object in the sky. The space shuttle regularly transmits data and communication signals to and from Earth, making it a likely target for someone using a transistor radio to listen for transmissions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
baby carriage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is an alternative to walking a small dog, and it is something that the dog can ride in. The option "baby carriage" is the most logical choice as it is commonly used to transport small children, and therefore would be a suitable size and shape for a small dog. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Michigan | Knowledge: The question asks about the possible habitat of an American weasel. Since the word "American" is used, the answer is likely to be a location within America. Michigan is a state in the United States that is known to have a variety of habitats suitable for weasels, including forests, fields, and wetlands. The other options, such as chicken coop, hen house or deep sea, are not suitable habitats for weasels. Great Britain is also not a likely option as it is not in America.
real estate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah had high hopes for her business, implying that it was a venture that could potentially generate a large amount of wealth or income. However, the fact that no one could get money to buy implies that the business involved some sort of product or service that people were interested in but could not afford. Real estate is a common industry where buyers need to secure financing in order to purchase properties, and the market can be volatile, leading to situations where investors can lose money. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
socialize | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the person is sitting at a friend's home and feeling bored, so it would make sense to engage in social interactions with the friend or others present. Watching TV, going somewhere, jumping rope, or cleaning the room do not necessarily involve social interactions or address the feeling of boredom.
create art | Knowledge: The other options do not suggest a legitimate way of earning money. Spending money does the opposite, begging is not a reliable or socially acceptable means of earning money, and gambling at a casino is not a guaranteed way to make money. Passing a course could lead to a higher-paying job, but it is not an immediate way of earning money. Creating art, on the other hand, can result in sales and commissions, making it a viable option for making money.
There is not a clear answer based on the given information. The sentence states that the man is drunk, but there is no further context provided regarding his behavior after the bar closes. Therefore, it is difficult to discern the correct answer.
countryside | Knowledge: The travelers expressed a desire to see the countryside, suggesting that they are likely not going to the airport, dock, train station, rest area, or bus depot. These locations are typically associated with transportation rather than sightseeing. The countryside is a popular destination for those seeking natural beauty and a more relaxed pace of life, making it a likely choice for the travelers' destination.
mistrial | Knowledge: Perjury refers to lying under oath in a legal setting, such as during a trial. If evidence was obtained illegally, it may not be admissible in court, which could result in a mistrial. A mistrial is declared when there is a fundamental error in the legal proceedings that prevents a fair trial from taking place, such as a violation of the defendant's right to due process. Going to jail or acquittal would depend on other factors and may not be directly related to the admissibility of evidence. Tension is not a likely outcome in this scenario.
do research | Knowledge: Writing a term paper requires a significant amount of research in order to ensure that the information included is accurate and credible. Without proper research, it can be difficult to fully understand the topic and provide detailed analysis. The other options listed may be helpful in some way, but they do not directly relate to the task of ensuring accuracy in a term paper.
water fountain | Knowledge: The question is asking where you could find something related to plumbing that could help you if you are thirsty. Out of the choices given, only a water fountain can provide water that is safe for drinking. The other choices (show, oil refineries, bathroom, and hardware store) are not associated with providing safe drinking water.
study greek  | Knowledge: The word "intelligent" suggests a person who is knowledgeable and educated, and studying Greek is often associated with academia and intelligence. The other options do not seem to directly relate to intelligence or education.
ignoble | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's goals were admirable, but his methods were not. The word "ignoble" means not honorable or respectable, so it is a likely answer choice. The other options don't fit the context of the sentence. Peasant, inferior, plebeian, and uneducated are all words that describe a person's social or educational status, which is not relevant to the man's goals and methods.
hospital | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the papers in question are medical papers, which are most commonly found in a hospital setting. The other options are more general and could apply to any setting where paperwork is common, but do not specifically suggest a medical context.
vengeance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is seeking revenge for the destruction of their family. The word "killing" implies violence, which is often associated with the desire for revenge. The other options do not make sense in the context of seeking revenge or taking violent actions.
feeling guilty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had been lying to many people, and as a result, had caused problems. The fact that the sentence specifies that the person feels guilty indicates that this is the most likely choice. The other options may be possible consequences of lying, but they do not fit as directly with the context of the sentence as feeling guilty does.
celebrate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy is happy about something that the other person did to improve themselves, which is a cause for celebration. The other options do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence.
leak | Knowledge: The word "soggy" implies that the ceiling was wet or damp, most likely due to water seeping through from above. The most logical explanation for this would be a leak in the roof, as a building or field would not be directly above the ceiling in question. "Metaphor" and "sag" are unlikely options, as they do not fit the physical description of the sentence.
furniture store | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where one can find an armchair, which is a type of furniture typically used for sitting. A furniture store is a logical answer choice as it specializes in selling various types of furniture. The other options, such as study, living room, grocery store, and hospital, do not have a clear connection to armchairs or the context of the question.
Japan | Knowledge: Kobe beef is a type of high-quality beef that comes from a specific breed of cattle that is raised in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan, which includes the city of Kobe. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the source of this steak house's Kobe beef is Japan. The other options do not have any connection to the origin of Kobe beef.
have fun | Knowledge: A party is generally viewed as a social event where people come together to enjoy themselves and socialize with others. The phrase "going to a party" suggests that the individuals in question are actively choosing to attend the event, which would likely indicate a desire to have a good time and enjoy themselves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the question, as they do not have a clear connection to the idea of attending a party.
All of the above | Knowledge: There are many reasons why someone may want to get in shape, and all of the options provided are valid reasons. Feeling good and desirable can be linked to increased confidence and self-esteem, while sex can be a motivating factor for some. Being overweight can have negative health effects, and avoiding disease is a common reason to improve physical fitness.
horseradish | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sauce was tangy, which is a characteristic commonly associated with horseradish sauce. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
great sorrow | Knowledge: The word "murder" suggests an act of violence and trauma inflicted upon someone, which could cause intense emotional pain and grief for their family members. "Bankruptcy" and "fear" are not directly related to the emotional impact of murder on a family. "Guilty conscience" may be more applicable to the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim's family. "Finding God" is a personal decision that may or may not be related to the effects of murder on a family.
breathing | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person who is drowning may be revived or rescued if they start breathing again. Breathing is essential for human survival, and not being able to breathe can lead to organ failure and death. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to drowning or physical distress.
northern california | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the meat from the cow farm was provided to the bay area, which is located in Northern California. This suggests that the cow farm is also likely located in that area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
adore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker has a negative opinion of the pop band, but is willing to take his daughter to see them despite this because she has a strong preference for them. The word "adore" indicates a strong level of love and admiration, which fits with the idea of a daughter who has a strong desire to see the band. The other options have different meanings that do not quite fit with the context of the sentence.
have children | Knowledge: The sentence implies that reproduction is being referred to in a biological sense, which typically results in the production of offspring or children. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or relate to biological reproduction.
new orleans | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly mentions the Mardi Gras parade, which is a famous festival celebrated in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The options "theatre," "movie house," and "hotel" do not necessarily imply that the person is in New Orleans or would have a view of the Mardi Gras parade. "Outside" is too general, and could refer to any location, whereas "new orleans" is specific and directly related to the context of the sentence.
story book | Knowledge: The question implies that a "talking bee" is not a real, physical presence that can be found in the world, but rather a fictional character that exists in a story book. The other options are all real-world locations where a bee might be found, but they do not fit the context of the question because they do not involve a "talking bee."
rural areas | Knowledge: County highways are typically found in rural areas rather than in urban areas. They are usually maintained by the county government rather than the state, which is why they are not typically found in highly populated areas. Michigan is a state, but it does not provide any context as to whether or not it is likely to have county highways. "Country" may refer to rural areas, but it is not a specific enough answer choice. "In town" suggests urban areas, which are not likely to have county highways. "Map" is not a relevant answer choice.
desk | Knowledge: The other options are all places where someone can find a desk, but the question is specifically asking where someone can keep a small clock. A desk is a common place to keep a small clock, as it can be easily accessible and visible. The other options do not necessarily have desks, and are not specifically associated with where someone would keep a small clock.
description | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the statistician already looked at an attribute, but wants more information about it. A description would provide more details and context about the attribute, allowing the statistician to make more informed decisions or draw more accurate conclusions. The other options, such as calculus or formulas, may be useful in certain statistical analyses, but are not necessarily applicable to this specific sentence. Similarly, an array or a sentence where described do not provide additional information about the attribute itself.
bus | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower while on a tour, and the options provide possible types of tours. "Garage" and "movies" are unlikely to be related to seeing the Eiffel Tower, "in Europe" is too broad and doesn't give a specific tour type, and "Paris" could be a tour option but it doesn't indicate how someone would see the Eiffel Tower. "Bus" is the most logical option as it is a common form of transportation for tours, and many tours in Paris specifically include stops at the Eiffel Tower.
behind the bathroom door | Knowledge: Bathroom towels are typically hung behind the bathroom door, on a towel rack or on hooks. The other options, such as a locker room or hotel, may also provide towels but they would not be stored in the same way as a personal bathroom towel. Cupboards and linen closets may hold towels, but they are not specifically associated with bathroom towels in the same way that behind the bathroom door is.
backyard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the herding dog had enough space to run and play, which is commonly found in a backyard. The other options do not provide a suitable space for a dog to run and play freely. The neighbor's house and outside are too vague and do not provide a clear location, while the farmyard may not necessarily have enough open space for a dog to play.
whiskers | Knowledge: Cats are known for having long whiskers, which are sensitive sensory organs used for navigation and detecting their surroundings. While cats also have long claws, legs, and lifespan, these characteristics are not typically described as "long" in the same way that whiskers are. Eyes may be described as large or round, but not necessarily long.
cross themselves | Knowledge: Crossing oneself is a common religious practice in the Catholic faith that is often done in times of stress or anxiety, as it is believed to offer comfort and reassurance. Burning oneself and dying are not typical responses to stress, and teaching or talking to each other may be practices among Catholics but are not specifically mentioned in the question as related to stress.
watering can | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tool being described is used to make plants wet, which is commonly associated with watering. The sentence also mentions a handle, which indicates that the tool can be carried. The only option that fits both criteria is a watering can. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bird cage | Knowledge: The phrase "your pet's home" implies that the pet in question is likely a bird, which is supported by the presence of a feather. A bird's home is typically a bird cage, which will have loose feathers as birds naturally molt their feathers. The other options do not relate to a bird's home or the presence of feathers.
start metabolism | Knowledge: Eating breakfast is often touted as the best meal of the day because it helps to kickstart the metabolism. After fasting overnight, the body's metabolism slows down, making it harder to burn calories throughout the day. Eating breakfast provides the body with the nutrients it needs to start burning calories and creating energy. Feeling satisfied, having energy, and gaining energy are all related to the metabolism starting up, rather than being the reason why breakfast is the best meal. Having a full stomach may be a result of eating breakfast, but it doesn't explain why it's the best meal of the day.
representative | Knowledge: The word "influence" suggests that the answer relates to politics or government. The most likely person to have influence on Washington from a given county is their representative in Congress, who can advocate for their constituents' interests and push for legislation that benefits their area. The other options (cleverest, bitterest, alter, sweet) do not make sense in this context or are not relevant to the question.
Antarctica | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being on a balcony can cause someone to feel cold, which may be due to the weather conditions in the location. Antarctica is a known cold and icy continent, making it the most likely option among the choices. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
one winner | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a competitive situation between two people, which usually results in one person winning and the other losing. The other options may be outcomes of a competition, but they do not necessarily reflect the main or most common outcome. "Encouraging" is not a common outcome in competitive situations, "injury" and "frustration" are negative outcomes that are not always present, and "pride" can be felt by both the winner and the loser.
disorientation | Knowledge: Drinking alcohol can impair a person's ability to function properly and can cause disorientation. This can include difficulty maintaining balance, blurred vision, and impaired judgment. These effects can lead to poor decision-making and decreased reaction time, making it dangerous for a person to operate a vehicle. The other options do not have a clear connection to the topic of drinking and driving.
pair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was frustrated about something related to the bookend he bought. The word "pair" indicates that bookends usually come in twos and are used to hold a pair of books upright on a shelf. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
college campus | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the football field is located on a college campus, as it is a popular spot for many people to gather. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feeling guilty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question did something wrong and is now experiencing a negative emotion as a result. The phrase "felt everybody judging him" implies that he is experiencing shame and remorse for his actions, which is a common feeling associated with guilt. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well and do not accurately describe the person's emotional state.
large city | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Indian restaurants can be found in many locations throughout the world. However, the answer option "more sophisticated town" lacks a clear connection to the context, while "curry" refers to a dish rather than a place. Therefore, the answer must be "large city," as cities typically have a larger population and a more diverse range of culinary options, including ethnic restaurants like Indian cuisine.
better life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if a person works hard, their situation will be improved, which likely means they will experience an improvement in their quality of life. Working hard can lead to better job opportunities or promotions, higher salaries, increased job security, and a sense of personal fulfillment. Compliments or acknowledgment may provide a boost to one's self-esteem, but they are not directly connected to improving one's situation. The American Dream is a concept, not a tangible outcome from hard work, and "headache" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
back yard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are less concerned with a certain lawn because it is out of view, which would likely refer to a back yard. Front yards are often a point of pride for homeowners and are visible from the street, making them an important part of curb appeal. Golf courses are typically well-maintained and visible to players and spectators alike. A garden may be important to its owner, but would not necessarily be overlooked by others. Suburbia is a place, not a lawn.
rest area | Knowledge: A rest area is a designated area on a highway or freeway where drivers can stop to take a break, stretch their legs, use the restroom, and sometimes even sleep. Rest areas often have benches or picnic tables with pillows or cushions for added comfort, but depending on where you are in the rest area, you may not be able to see the pillows or cushions. The other options, such as bedroom, home or kitchen, are more likely to have visible pillows, and "make seat softer" is not a place but a description of an action.
tuxedo | Knowledge: The word "gentleman" suggests a formal or sophisticated context, which is further supported by the option "tuxedo" being among the answer choices. A gentleman might own a tuxedo and wear it to formal events or occasions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
eat meat | Knowledge: The sentence states that dogs are omnivores, meaning they consume both plants and animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be something related to their diet, such as eating meat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
egypt | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person is an expert in hieroglyphics, which are primarily associated with Ancient Egypt. This suggests that the excavation site is likely to be located in Egypt as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lower prices | Knowledge: When inflation is present, prices tend to rise due to the decrease in the purchasing power of money. Fighting inflation usually involves measures that decrease the amount of money in circulation, which helps to control price increases. Therefore, we can expect to see lower prices at stores if a country or organization is successful in fighting inflation. The other choices do not make logical sense within the context of the question, as raising interest rates or increasing demand for goods could actually exacerbate inflation.
book of stories | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common activity between a mother and child, reading stories. The answer can be inferred from the context that the question provides. The other options, such as tall building, British building, mall, and moon, do not make sense in this context.
heart attacks | Knowledge: The word "intensely" suggests that the jogging is being done at a demanding level, which can increase the risk of heart attacks. Intense physical activity can put a strain on the heart, especially in individuals who are not used to such activity or have underlying cardiovascular issues. Blisters may occur from excessive jogging, but they are not a life-threatening condition. While improved health is a potential benefit of regular exercise, the sentence is specifically referring to the negative consequences of too much intense jogging. "Practice for mar-than" is not a valid option.
story book | Knowledge: The question suggests that the cow in question does not exist in reality, meaning it can only be found in fictional sources such as story books. The other options (great outdoors, field, barnyard) all suggest real-life locations where one might find actual cows, and the option toy store suggests a toy cow, which still exists as a physical object. Therefore, the correct answer is story book.
television | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically for information in audio format, which is commonly found on television through news broadcasts, documentaries, and other programs. Books, articles, and newspapers are typically in written form, and meetings do not necessarily provide audio recordings for information seeking purposes.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's team is not doing well in the game, which can be a cause of stress and frustration. Excitement and entertainment may be present if the game is being played well, but not if the team is losing. Envy is not a typical emotion in this situation, and anxiousness is only possible if the person is invested in the outcome of the game.
porch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Timmy is throwing a newspaper and is unable to throw it far enough to land it on something specific. The word "up" also implies that the target is at a higher level than Timmy. The most likely target in this scenario would be a porch, as newspapers are commonly thrown onto porches. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as newspapers would not typically be thrown onto a library, jail, subway or floor.
lower blood pressure | Knowledge: The sentence mentions taking measurements with an armband, which is a common method for measuring blood pressure. The doctor's recommendation of medicine suggests that the patient may have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, which requires medication to lower it. None of the other choices have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
video game | Knowledge: The context indicates that the question is referring to a battle that is not real, which rules out options like Vietnam, Iraq or war as these are real-life situations where battles can occur. A court room battle may involve a conflict or a legal dispute, but it is not a physical battle. A video game, however, often involves virtual battles and conflicts that are created in a simulated world, making it the correct answer.
further knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence is stating that reading books can provide more information on a subject. The phrase "further knowledge" specifically refers to gaining additional understanding or insight on a topic. The other options do not accurately relate to the purpose of reading books for more information.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had access to other sinks but ended up washing dishes somewhere specific. The most logical option would be his own home, as it's unlikely he would be able to use a laboratory or office sink and it's unclear why he would go to his neighbor's house to wash dishes. The laundry room is a possibility, but given that the sentence focuses solely on John's kitchen sink being clogged, it's likely that he used a sink in the kitchen of his home.
labyrinth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is navigating a maze or labyrinth, as he is using a common trick of always keeping one hand on the wall to prevent himself from getting lost or backtracking. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
buy food | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy is unable to cook or use his microwave, which are both common ways of preparing food. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Billy needs money to buy food instead. The other options (go on a date, pay bills, get things, control people) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
apartment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the sink is in the bachelor's living space as it mentions that he didn't bother cleaning it. The options chemistry lab, front desk, and laboratory suggest a work or public space, which is unlikely to have a sink that the bachelor would be responsible for cleaning. The laundry room is also less likely as it is not mentioned that the bachelor does his laundry. This leaves us with the option of apartment, which fits with the context of the sentence as it is a common living space with a sink that would require regular cleaning.
dentist's office | Knowledge: The question mentions getting an x-ray of your jaw, which indicates that you are at a dental appointment. Waiting rooms are typically associated with medical and dental offices, but the mention of an x-ray and jaw suggest that the correct answer is a dentist's office. The other choices do not have any clear relevance to the context provided.
vomiting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man showed a sign of sickness before losing consciousness, which is commonly associated with vomiting. Vomiting can be a symptom of excessive alcohol consumption, which is indicated by the fact that the man had been out for a long night. The other options, such as dream, panic, cancer or blurred vision, do not have any clear connection to the context of excessive alcohol consumption and sickness.
apartment | Knowledge: The word "small areas" suggests that the answer should be a type of living space that is compact and efficient. Apartments are commonly associated with smaller living spaces, making them a likely answer. The other choices do not typically offer small living spaces: opera houses are venues for performances, supermarkets are shopping centers, train stations are transportation hubs, and mansions are large, luxurious homes.
wishing well | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James's parents were concerned about his spending habits, indicating that the object he puts his coin in is likely associated with a frivolous or extravagant activity. Wishing wells are often associated with making wishes and whimsy, so it is plausible that James is making a wish with his coin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
repair shop | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place where John would take his lawnmower, which implies that he is looking for a tool or service to fix a mechanical problem with the lawnmower. Among the choices, only "repair shop" fits this description. The other options do not provide any useful service for fixing a lawnmower; a car dealership sells cars, a toolkit is a collection of tools and not a place where one can fix equipment, a bar is a place to drink and socialize, and a tool box is simply a container for tools.
neglect | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the girl did not give proper attention or care to the bunny, which is an act of neglect. The other options may describe the girl's attitude towards the bunny, but neglect is the only option that specifically refers to the bunny's suffering as a result of the girl's inaction.
fly away | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mosquitoes are in danger of being killed by a fly swatter, and it is implied that they need to do something to survive. "Fly away" is a realistic option for the mosquitoes because it is a natural defense mechanism that they possess. The other options are not realistic solutions for the mosquitoes' predicament. "Spread disease" is a negative consequence of mosquitoes, but it does not pertain to their immediate need for survival in this situation. "Swamp" and "bug campers" are not actions that mosquitoes are capable of taking, and "buzz off" is a phrase that implies leaving but does not give a specific action for the mosquitoes to take.
ruined | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that attempting to clean the outfit would be futile, implying that the damage to the outfit is irreversible. The word "useless" suggests that the outfit is beyond repair and cannot be salvaged. The other options do not convey the same sense of irreparable damage.
outside | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that getting completely dirty is something that is likely to happen to a dog when they are outside. Dogs often enjoy rolling around in dirt or mud when they are outside, which can result in them getting covered in dirt. The other options do not make as much sense as dogs are unlikely to get completely dirty in those contexts.
staggering | Knowledge: The sentence describes a man who is exhibiting signs of being heavily intoxicated, such as struggling to walk properly. The word "staggering" specifically means to walk unsteadily or swaying from side to side, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options (falling down, throwing up, getting arrested, turning into a butterfly) do not accurately describe the man's current state or match the context of the sentence.
hug | Knowledge: The act of comforting a friend generally involves physically showing empathy and support through some kind of physical touch or gesture. A hug is a common way to convey these feelings, while a handshake or giving money would not be considered an appropriate way to comfort someone in distress. Feeling bad might be a natural response to a friend's suffering, but it is not an action that would be taken to help them feel better.
monastery | Knowledge: The context suggests that the people being referred to are likely members of a religious community or order, given that they refer to each other as "brother" despite not being related by blood. The option "monastery" fits this context best, as it is a place where monks live in a community and refer to each other as "brother." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
warehouse | Knowledge: Boxes of products are typically stored in a warehouse, which is a large space specifically designed for storing and organizing goods. The other options (shoe store, basement, shed, garage) are not typically used for large-scale storage of products.
new mexico | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Canadian traveler visited a location in the southwestern region. While Canada is mentioned as the traveler's country of origin, it is not a viable option since it is not located in the southwestern region. Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico are all states located in the southwestern region of the United States, but only New Mexico is a viable option since it is the only location mentioned in the sentence that the traveler actually visited. Peru is a country located in South America, so it is not a viable option either.
chemise | Knowledge: The context of the question refers to a garment worn by the flappers of the 1920s, which were known for their fashion style. The options "iphone," "baggage," and "golf bag" are not related to garment and can be eliminated. The option "brassiere" could be a possible answer, but it is important to note that the question refers specifically to a garment with thin shoulder straps, which is a characteristic commonly associated with a chemise.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The question mentions hunting, which suggests that the answer is related to buying guns for the purpose of hunting. A sporting goods store would be the most likely place to find such guns, as they often sell gear and equipment for sports and outdoor activities, including hunting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
internet | Knowledge: The phrase "fairly new" suggests that the answer is a technology or method that has emerged in recent years. While books and libraries have been around for centuries, the internet is a relatively recent invention and has revolutionized the way we access information. The word "manual" appears twice in the choices but is unlikely to be the correct answer as it simply means a set of instructions or a guidebook and is not a new way to access information.
nest full of babies  | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a specific item that can be commonly found when discovering a snake's home. Snakes are known to lay eggs or give birth to live offspring in a nest, making the option "nest full of babies" the most likely choice. The other options don't align with a typical snake habitat or characteristics.
make decisions | Knowledge: The phrase "think autonomously" suggests that the computer would have the ability to make decisions on its own, without human intervention. While it would likely also be able to receive and process data and information, those abilities alone are not necessarily indicative of autonomous thinking. The options "believe in god" and "control fate" are not related to the concept of computer programming or artificial intelligence.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe and Jim were under pressure to complete their tasks quickly, which may have led to them experiencing stress. Stress is a common response to feeling overwhelmed or having too many demands placed on oneself. The other options, such as efficiency and net gain, do not accurately reflect the negative feeling that is implied in the sentence.
It depends on the context of the question. If the question is asking about a typical place of employment, the answer would be "a business," "corporation," "company," or "office," depending on the specific type of organization. If the question is asking about a specific event or activity that employees participate in, the answer could be "meeting" or something else entirely. More information is needed to determine the correct answer.
hand | Knowledge: The question asks about what can be used to write with a steel pen, which implies that the answer will be a body part or a writing utensil. The word "hand" is the only option that fits this criteria and is commonly used to hold and write with a pen. The other choices are places or objects that do not have any apparent connection to writing or pens.
knowing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering facts is a way to demonstrate a certain concept when taking a test. The options "sadness," "pleasure," and "depression" are emotions and are unlikely to be related to demonstrating knowledge on a test. "Knowledge" is related to the concept of facts and information, which is the focus of the sentence. Therefore, "knowing" is the correct answer choice.
furniture store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is looking for a specific piece of furniture, an ottoman, which is typically sold in furniture stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to furniture shopping. A basement may contain furniture, but it is not a common place to go looking for something specific. Decoration and parlor are not related to furniture shopping at all. A couch outlet may sell ottomans, but it is not as common as a furniture store.
boredom | Knowledge: Yawning and pacing are often associated with behaviors that people exhibit when they are bored. Yawning is a reflex that is triggered when the body needs more oxygen, which can happen when someone is sedentary or not mentally engaged. Pacing is a common way to pass the time when someone is feeling restless or bored. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backpack | Knowledge: This question suggests that the person is preparing to go outside with knives, which is most commonly associated with activities such as camping, hiking, or survival. It is unlikely that someone would bring knives to a purse or a drawer, as they are not practical for outdoor activities. Sporting goods stores might sell knives, but they are not a place to put them before heading out. The kitchen is also an unlikely choice, as knives would not be useful if left there while going outside. The best option is a backpack, which is often used for carrying items while doing outdoor activities.
garage | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a place where a person would put their automobile when not using it. The option 'garage' is the most appropriate choice as it is a common place for storing cars when not in use. The other options, such as 'highway,' 'fast lane,' 'freeway,' and 'street,' do not make sense in this context as they are locations for driving and not parking an automobile.
Manhattan | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is a densely populated area with skyscrapers that blend in, which is a common characteristic of Manhattan. Manhattan is known for its high concentration of skyscrapers and its dense urban landscape, which could explain why it is one of the few places where a skyscraper would blend in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
center | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was measuring from each edge of something, which indicates that he was trying to find the center. The other options do not make sense in the context of measuring from each edge.
woods | Knowledge: The question is asking where someone is likely to find a marmoset outside of a zoo. Marmosets are small primates that are typically found in wooded areas of Central and South America. The other options do not have any clear connection to the natural habitat of a marmoset, making "woods" the most logical choice.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cemetery is located in an area where there are many houses and businesses nearby, which is a common characteristic of urban or city areas. Churchyards may also be surrounded by houses, but the sentence doesn't mention a church or any religious affiliation. The option "most cities" is too vague and doesn't provide a specific location. The options "ocean" and "field" are not likely places to find a cemetery surrounded by houses and businesses.
store | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the person is looking to acquire marble, which is a type of material. Out of the given choices, "store" is the most likely place to find marble as it is often sold in home improvement or construction stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
traveling | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order to get to the market, the person needs to travel or make a journey. The other options, such as seeing other people or buying food, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence. Additionally, the last option of buying vegetables and crossing many roads seems like a specific and potentially unnecessary detail, which makes it unlikely to be the correct answer.
get somewhere | Knowledge: Involuntarily means doing something without choice or control, so the closest option to that definition is "get somewhere." The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of involuntarily, as arriving, driving, and stumbling down all suggest some level of intentionality or control, while might drive car is a vague statement that does not provide a clear alternative to involuntary action.
ask questions | Knowledge: The question is asking about when someone needs to seek information about their adopted parents. The most logical option is to "ask questions" since this is a common way to obtain information from others. "Death" and "procedures" do not necessarily relate to the context of the question. "Learn" and "go to school" may be related to education but do not provide clear answers to the question.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a state that is shaped like a glove and has a delicatessen where you can get something to eat. Michigan is shaped like a mitten, which is similar to a glove, and is known for its famous delicatessens, particularly in the Detroit area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
trying | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the high jumper was attempting to break a record, and it specifically mentions that this was his second and final attempt. Therefore, it is logical to assume that he was still "trying" to break the record, rather than "leaving," "failing," "finishing," or "giving up." These other choices are all possible outcomes of the high jumper's attempt, but they do not directly answer the question of what he was doing to break the record.
wait turn | Knowledge: The phrase "standing in line" typically implies waiting for your turn in a queue, which suggests that the answer is "wait turn." The other options do not fit with the context and are not common outcomes of waiting in line. Fatigue and pain might result from standing in one place for a long time, but they are not the main purpose or outcome of standing in line. Success and anger are also unlikely outcomes of waiting in a line.
toilet | Knowledge: The other options in the choices do not raise any concerns about drinking water from them, but drinking water from a toilet is generally considered unsanitary and can lead to illness. The surface of the earth and bridges may pose risks due to pollution or contaminants, but they can be avoided by finding a clean source of water. A jar and the moon are not relevant to this question.
tent | Knowledge: Soldiers who are deployed in the field typically do not have access to permanent structures, such as buildings or vehicles, for sleeping arrangements. Instead, they are more likely to sleep in temporary structures like tents or shelters, which can be easily set up and taken down. The other options, such as armored cars and the White House, do not make sense as potential sleeping locations for an active soldier.
store  | Knowledge: The sentence implies that jellyfish are commonly found in certain locations, but not in others. The Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean are all bodies of water where jellyfish are known to exist. A Japanese restaurant might serve jellyfish as a culinary delicacy, so it is also not an unlikely place to find them. Therefore, the answer is "store", which is a location where jellyfish are not typically found.
stop breathing | Knowledge: Suffocation is a condition where a person is unable to breathe properly, which can cause them to stop breathing altogether. This means that the correct answer is "stop breathing". The other options do not accurately describe the cause of suffocation or its effects on the body.
cockpit | Knowledge: A pilot is someone who operates an aircraft, so it makes sense that they would most easily be found in the cockpit, which is the area of the aircraft where the pilot sits and controls the plane. The other options are less likely as they do not relate to the pilot's job or location, such as a space shuttle (which is not as commonly flown as airplanes), a shower (which has nothing to do with the pilot's occupation), the sky (which is too broad of an answer), or an airplane (which is too general and does not specify where the pilot would be located within the airplane).
stress | Knowledge: The word "competing" suggests that people are facing a situation where they have to fight for resources that are limited and cannot be shared by everyone. This can lead to a feeling of pressure, anxiety, and tension, which are all characteristics of stress. The other choices are not necessarily associated with the idea of competition, nor do they describe an emotional state that is commonly linked to it. "Defeat" and "aggression," for example, imply a more active response, while "winning or losing" and "confusion" do not necessarily capture the emotional dimension of competition.
It is not possible to determine the correct answer based on the information given in the question.
hungry | Knowledge: The other options are related to actions related to food, but "hungry" is the only option that indicates a need or desire to eat. Cooking, eating, and shopping are activities related to obtaining or preparing food, but they do not necessarily indicate a specific time or reason for eating. "Burned" is not related to the context of the question. Therefore, "hungry" is the correct answer.
water mark | Knowledge: Placing a napkin under a cup is a common practice to prevent condensation from leaving unsightly marks on the surface of the table. Noise and knocking over are not related to the action of placing a napkin, while "put down" is too vague and doesn't suggest any specific reason to use a napkin.
house | Knowledge: The sentence states that "many different materials are needed" to make this dwelling, suggesting that it is a complex and substantial structure. "House" is the most common and appropriate term for such a dwelling. "Construction" refers to the process of building, not the end product, while "anything" is too vague and "fabric store" implies a building that specializes in selling textiles rather than a residence.
Quebec | Knowledge: Quebec is located in Canada, which is a North American country that is known for its French heritage and cuisine. French is one of Canada's official languages, and Quebec is particularly well-known for its French-inspired dishes, such as poutine and crepes. Neither Wine nor Manhattan are cities, and while NYC (New York City) does have some French restaurants, it is not located in a North American country other than the United States. Paris is located in France, which is in Europe, and thus not a North American country.
not dry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting wet has a specific outcome, which is being the opposite of dry. Shivering and getting cold may be possible effects of getting wet, but they are not necessarily the definitive result. Shiver is a verb and does not describe a state of being, while shrinkage refers to something getting smaller, which does not fit the context of the sentence.
bones | Knowledge: When preparing a fish for service, it is common practice to remove the bones, as they can be a choking hazard or detract from the texture of the filet. The other options either do not apply to fish anatomy (no legs or organs), or are not typically removed prior to service (gills and scales).
not feel pain | Knowledge: The sentence does not provide enough context to accurately determine why a person would drop out of school, but it does suggest that the reason is related to not feeling pain. This could be interpreted in a few different ways, such as the person having a medical condition that makes it difficult to attend school, or the person not experiencing any consequences for dropping out. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
rain cloud | Knowledge: The question is asking about water in the sky, which is typically in the form of clouds. Clouds are formed when water evaporates from the surface of the Earth and rises up into the atmosphere, where it cools and condenses into visible water droplets or ice crystals. These water droplets then form clouds and can eventually fall back to the surface as precipitation, such as rain or snow. The other options do not explain the origin of water in the sky.
butcher shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Garry is feeling very hungry, and the phrase "eat a whole cow" implies that he wants to eat a large amount of meat. Therefore, it makes sense that he would go to a place where he can buy meat to satisfy his hunger, such as a butcher shop. The other options, such as barnyard or dairy farm, do not necessarily have an association with places where one would go to buy meat.
smiles | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning about science has a positive effect on students, which is commonly associated with smiling or feeling satisfied. Accidents and frustration have a negative connotation and are unlikely to be associated with learning about science. "Become educated" is a possible outcome of learning about science but does not address the emotional response of students to the subject matter.
celebrate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being addressed will have won a race, and the question is asking what they will do afterward. "Celebrate" is the most logical choice, as it is a common response to winning a competition or achieving a goal. "Matchwinning" and "compete" are not appropriate, as they do not refer to actions that would typically follow winning a race. "Cash in" could potentially be a correct answer if the race had a monetary prize, but there is no indication of this in the sentence.
pantry | Knowledge: Non perishable foods are typically items that can be stored for long periods of time without going bad or spoiling. The pantry is a storage area in a kitchen that is specifically designed for storing non perishable food items such as canned goods, dried fruits and vegetables, pasta, and rice, which are all examples of foods that can be stored for long periods of time. The other options (stove, table, plate, jar) are all typically used for cooking or serving food, but are not storage areas for non perishable foods.
zoo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that elephants are captured and brought somewhere to live, which is commonly done for display purposes in zoos. While elephants may also live in circuses or be owned by private individuals in cities, the use of the word "captured" suggests that they are not there by choice and may be kept in captivity. The option "weight 1000 kilos" is not a location and has no relevance to the question. Africa is the natural habitat of elephants, but the question specifically asks about where captured elephants live.
closet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man has returned home, which implies that he would want to store his luggage. This would typically be done in a closet or storage area within the home. The other options (taxi, bus stop, train station, trunk) do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they are not locations where luggage would typically be stored.
hand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer is related to body parts, specifically fingers. The only option that is directly related to fingers is "hand," as fingers are a part of the hand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
town | Knowledge: The description of passing residences, stores, and other public buildings is typical of a town or a city. A valley is a geological feature, and although there may be towns located in valleys, the description does not specifically mention anything about the surrounding geography. A bridge is a structure used to cross over bodies of water or other obstacles, and would not be the correct answer in this context. Highway refers to a major road typically used for long-distance travel, and would not typically have a group of residences and stores. North America is a continent, and not a possible answer in this context.
in the attic | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a specific location where a ventilation system should be closed. Attics are often a source of heat loss in homes and closing the ventilation system can help prevent this. In contrast, buildings like offices, hospitals, and large buildings typically have much more complex ventilation systems that would not be as simple to close off. The option "house" is too broad and does not specify a specific location, while "hospital" and "large building" may not have attics at all.
winery | Knowledge: The question implies that the grape is being used to make an alcoholic beverage. Alcoholic beverages are commonly produced in wineries, which are facilities dedicated to processing grapes and turning them into wine. The other options, such as rows or fruit stands, do not have any association with the production of alcohol.
exercise | Knowledge: The question is asking for the best way to release energy, which implies that the energy is pent up or excessive. Yelling may release some energy in the moment, but it is not a sustainable or healthy way to release energy. Thinking may help to process emotions or ideas, but it does not physically release energy. Resting may help to conserve energy, but it does not release any. Working off energy through exercise is a common and effective way to physically release energy and improve overall health and wellbeing.
begin work | Knowledge: The question suggests that hunger can motivate someone to do something, and of the options presented, "begin work" is the most plausible. Hunger can push someone to get started on tasks they may be putting off, such as preparing a meal or starting work. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
jump rope | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the activity being referred to is something that elementary school friends commonly do together. Jump rope is a classic playground game that is popular among children in this age range. The other options, such as going somewhere or going out at night, are unlikely for elementary school students who are typically under the supervision of their parents or guardians. Similarly, telling stories or teaching may be more appropriate for older students with more advanced language skills.
chills | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the athlete was overheated and needed to cool down. The use of an ice bath, which involves immersing oneself in very cold water, is a common way for athletes to quickly reduce their body temperature. The term "chills" refers to the shivering and feeling of coldness that can occur when someone is exposed to cold temperatures. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
theatre | Knowledge: The question is asking about a specific type of performance, a Broadway show. Broadway shows are typically performed in theaters, so it would make the most sense for the audience to clap in the theater. The other options, such as opera, hockey game, and school, do not typically involve the audience clapping in the same way as a Broadway show.
school | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that Danny is a young person who is not yet employed, which suggests that he is still in the process of completing his education. The most likely place for a young person without a job to be spending their time is in school, where they would be pursuing an education and preparing for future employment opportunities. The other options are less likely because they do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
suburbia | Knowledge: The phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" is a common expression that refers to the practice of trying to match or surpass the wealth or social status of one's neighbors or community. In this context, the man's efforts to maintain his lawn suggest that he is trying to meet the expectations or standards of his suburban community, which is often associated with the concept of keeping up with the Joneses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cup | Knowledge: Waitresses typically work in restaurants and are responsible for serving drinks to customers. Refilling a "cup" makes the most sense in this context, as it is a vessel used for holding beverages that customers might want more of. The other options do not make sense in the context of a waitress's job duties.
shopping mall | Knowledge: Marmosets are primates that are typically found in tropical rainforests, so they would be out of place in a shopping mall, which is an indoor commercial area. The other options are all environments that could potentially be suitable for a marmoset: warm climate refers to the natural habitat of the species, France has a variety of climates that could support a marmoset, burrows are dug by animals and could be a potential home for a marmoset, and the great outdoors encompasses a wide range of outdoor environments.
school | Knowledge: Schools are educational institutions specifically designed to provide children with learning opportunities. Soccer games and Disneyland may be entertaining for children but they do not contribute to their learning. The zoo may have some educational opportunities, but it is not a primary destination for children to learn. Nurseries may be for young children, but they are not specifically designed for educational learning opportunities.
winch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to off road driving and the need for a strong steel cable. A winch is a device that is commonly used in off road driving to help pull vehicles out of tough terrain situations. Therefore, a strong steel cable would be necessary for the winch to be effective. The other options do not have any clear connection to off road driving or the need for a strong steel cable.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mat was placed in a location where slipping is a concern, which is commonly associated with bathrooms. Furthermore, the sentence suggests that the mat was chosen to match the colors of everything else in the same location, which further supports the idea that the mat was placed in a bathroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
emit light | Knowledge: Since the power went out, the family needed a source of light, which would suggest that the candle was used for emitting light. The other options may be characteristics of a candle, but they do not directly tie into the context of the sentence.
dry hands | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the camper tried washing his hands after building a fire, which suggests that his hands may have been dirty or sooty. Washing hands with soap and water can sometimes result in dryness, which is why the option "dry hands" is the most likely answer. The other options do not make much sense in the context of the sentence.
at Cape Canaveral | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that munitions were loaded onto a launch platform, which suggests that the context relates to a military or space launch operation. Cape Canaveral is a famous launch site for NASA and the US military, so it is the most likely option. Trapeze, battleship, and kitchen are all unrelated to the context of a launch platform for munitions. NASA is a possible option, but it is not specific enough to indicate the location of the launch platform.
disoriented | Knowledge: Being overly drunk can lead to a sense of disorientation, as alcohol affects the brain's ability to process sensory information and control movement. The other options, such as "appear ridiculous" and "raise hell," may also be associated with being drunk, but they do not necessarily apply universally and may depend on the individual's behavior. "Walk off" and "throw up" are specific actions that may occur as a result of being drunk, but do not necessarily capture the overall impression that someone would have of a drunk person.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the restaurant is located in a place where one can sleep, which is commonly associated with hotels. Many hotels offer on-site restaurants that are open to both guests and non-guests, and some may even offer the option to dine in your room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
email | Knowledge: This question is asking about how companies typically communicate advertisements directly to consumers. The options "bus," "la ville," and "carrier pigeon" are not common methods of advertising communication, making them unlikely correct answers. "Web page" is a possible option, as many companies use their website to display and promote their products or services. However, the most common and direct method of advertising communication is through email, which is a widely used platform for marketing campaigns and newsletters.
dribble | Knowledge: A leaky faucet is one that drips water slowly and steadily. Therefore, the correct answer is "dribble," which means to flow or trickle in small amounts. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of a leaky faucet. A water spout is a device used to pour water or control water flow, wet clothes is not related to a leaky faucet, a power turbine is a machine that generates power from a fluid or gas, and thin soup is a type of soup that is not related to the question.
bore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was not a good neighbor. They were considered annoying, which implies that they did not give others much peace or quiet. The word "bore" has a similar connotation in that it refers to someone who is tedious or uninteresting to be around. The other options do not accurately capture the negative traits associated with the person in the sentence.
silent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is a quiet or silent environment where even small noises are easily heard. The word "amplified" implies that the sounds are being magnified or made louder than they would be in a normal setting. The use of the word "hummed hymn" suggests that the environment is likely a religious setting, such as a church or chapel, where people may be singing quietly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well since they do not suggest a quiet or silent environment.
kiss  | Knowledge: Foreplay generally refers to sexual activities that occur before sexual intercourse, intended to increase arousal and pleasure for both partners. Kissing is a common form of foreplay that can help to establish intimacy and create physical attraction between partners. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of sexual activity and foreplay.
church | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the religious community was having a bake sale in a location that is commonly associated with a church, which is usually where religious communities gather. The other options do not make sense in this context - a closet or an office building are unlikely locations for a bake sale, and a parking lot or someone's own house may not be suitable locations for a religious community event.
marching band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item being purchased is needed to complete a set of instruments for a specific purpose. The term "bass drum" is most often associated with marching bands, as it is a large percussion instrument commonly used in outdoor performances. The other options (rock band, orchestra, drum set, violin) do not necessarily require a bass drum as a fundamental instrument.
nostalgia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing old things created a long time ago may create a specific emotion or feeling. The choice "reverence" may seem correct because old things may be seen as valuable or significant, but the word "cause" implies a more emotional response. "Painful memories" and "depression" are both negative and not necessarily associated with simply seeing old things. "Curiosity" might be a possibility, but it does not match the tone of the sentence. "Nostalgia" fits best because it describes a sentimental longing or wistful affection for things from the past, which is a common reaction to seeing old things.
bones | Knowledge: Dogs are carnivorous animals and are known to enjoy eating bones as a part of their natural diet. Bones can provide important nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for bone and teeth health. Mice, bad breath, four legs, and fleas do not make sense as answers and are not related to the question at hand.
dexterity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was not good at climbing despite being nimble, which implies that his lack of skill in climbing may not be due to physical strength or muscle mass. Dexterity refers to having fine motor skills and the ability to manipulate objects with precision and accuracy, which may be a crucial skill in climbing. The other options may contribute to climbing ability to some extent, but they are not necessarily the most relevant or specific to the context of the sentence.
airport | Knowledge: The keyword "passageway" suggests a location with a lot of foot traffic, which is commonly associated with airports where a lot of people are constantly moving from one place to another. The other options - gate, building, jungle, and cave - do not typically have a high volume of people passing through them.
impress | Knowledge: The word "playfully" suggests that the act of farting is not meant to be taken seriously, and is likely done as a joke or a way to be entertaining. The use of the word "impress" suggests that the goal behind the playful farting is to elicit a positive reaction from others, possibly through humor or shock value. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they do not convey a sense of playfulness or humor.
twist and shout  | Knowledge: The sentence references an old song about "twisting," which suggests that the answer will reference some action related to twisting. The phrase "twist and shout" is a well-known reference to a song by The Beatles, which is a common cultural reference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
good health | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trait being described is something that is associated with a "bright green ficus." Ficuses are a type of plant, and plants that are bright green in color are typically healthy and have plenty of chlorophyll. Therefore, the correct answer is "good health." The other options - arboretum (a garden of trees and shrubs), lobby (entrance area of a building), pots (container used for growing plants), and own home (the place where one lives) - do not provide any clues that would lead to the correct answer.
grow | Knowledge: The sentence implies that meeting interesting people will lead to an expansion of your contacts list. "Grow" is the most appropriate choice to describe this idea, as it indicates an increase in size. "Remember names" is too specific and does not capture the full extent of the impact of meeting interesting people, while "friendly" and "cordial" describe personal behavior rather than the effects of social interaction. "Friendship" is also too specific and could imply a deeper connection than what is suggested in the sentence.
landscape | Knowledge: The sentence implies that climbing a hill provides a good vantage point to view a specific subject. The options "great outdoors," "the clown," "Virginia," and "countryside" do not fit this context as they are vague or unrelated to a specific view. "Landscape" is the most specific option and makes sense as the subject to be surveyed from a hilltop. It is also a commonly used term to refer to natural scenery visible from a distant viewpoint.
neighborhood | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the homes are attached to one another, which is a common feature of neighborhoods with row houses or townhouses. Apartment buildings may have homes that are connected vertically, but not horizontally as in a row of homes. Michigan is a state and not a location description. Countryside is not typically associated with homes being attached together in a group. City or town could be a possibility, but neighborhood is more specific to groups of homes that are attached together.
race track | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the competition involves speed, which is commonly associated with races. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Populated areas and supermarkets are not typically associated with competing for speed, and a busy supermarket or a classroom may have obstacles or rules that would make it difficult to have a race.
go shopping | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has a problem of spending money, and their favorite hobby is related to spending money. Going shopping is an activity that involves spending money, making it the best fit for the answer. The other options do not relate to spending money, or in some cases, contradict the problem of spending money.
stiffness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah is experiencing pain in her legs while riding a horse, which is often associated with stiffness in the muscles due to prolonged periods of sitting and holding onto the horse. The other options do not relate to this context - bouncing and shaky suggest an unstable ride, fear suggests a psychological response, and movement is too generic.
open sores | Knowledge: Skin picking is a compulsive behavior that can lead to the formation of open sores on the skin. This is because picking can cause damage to the skin's protective barrier, making it more vulnerable to infections and other irritations. Bloody marks may also be present in areas where the skin has been picked, but they are not always necessarily present. Schizophrenia and anxiety are mental health conditions that are not directly related to skin picking or its consequences. The option "different" is too vague to be a correct answer.
pointed ears | Knowledge: The question asks for a physical characteristic of dogs that can be seen. Pointed ears are a common feature of many dog breeds and can be easily visible to the human eye. The other choices (fleas, ticks, no consciousness, bad breath) are not physical characteristics that can be easily seen, or are not characteristics of dogs that people typically focus on.
hockey game | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is excitement associated with certain sports or activities. Soccer and dance may be exciting to some, but the phrasing "most excitement" suggests a higher level of energy and intensity. A hockey game is known for being fast-paced, physical, and thrilling, making it the most likely answer. The other options, library and car show, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not active or sports-based.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans in cities seek out nature, which is commonly found in parks. Parks are green spaces that are usually located within cities and offer a place for people to connect with nature, relax, and participate in outdoor activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
die | Knowledge: The sentence implies that not eating will have a negative consequence for the animal, and the most extreme consequence of not eating is death. Meat and cuddly pet are not outcomes of not eating, while feeling hunger is a normal physiological response to not eating. Learning how to dance has no relevance to the context of the sentence.
transfer of information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the husband and wife communicated about their apartment search and the husband is now looking at apartments. The most likely reason for this is to transfer information from the wife to the husband about the availability and suitability of different apartments. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence - confusion and misunderstandings imply that there was a breakdown in communication, exchanging ideas implies a two-way conversation rather than a transfer of information, and static doesn't fit at all.
sucking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action in question was the opposite of blowing. Since the sentence mentions that "there was no blowing," it implies that the action being referred to was not a physical exhale. The terms "sucking" and "breathe in" indicate an action that involves inhaling air, which is the opposite of exhaling. The other options are synonyms for inhaling and do not provide any clear contrast to the action of blowing.
hawaii | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John lives on a small island surrounded by flowing liquid H2O, which most likely refers to water, a characteristic commonly associated with islands in the ocean. Hawaii is an island in the Pacific Ocean, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the description given in the sentence.
severe injuries | Knowledge: Fencing is a sport that involves using a weapon to strike opponents while wearing protective gear. Due to the nature of the sport, if proper safety precautions are not taken, there is a risk of severe injuries such as cuts or punctures. The other options are not directly related to the potential risks of fencing.
entertainment | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the act of listening to music is an activity that provides enjoyment or pleasure, which is often associated with the concept of entertainment. While music can also produce vibrations and evoke emotions such as calm or relaxation, these options do not fully encompass the idea of actively engaging in an entertaining experience. The option "smile" is also not an accurate answer, as smiling is a physical response that may or may not accompany the act of listening to music, and is not directly related to the experience of consuming music itself.
battle | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that Jo is a leader of a military force. Military forces engage in battles or fights in order to achieve their objectives. A military company is merely a unit within a larger military organization and is not typically associated with winning battles. An army refers to a large group of soldiers, but it still engages in battles to achieve its objectives. A pack refers to a group of animals, which is not relevant in the context of the sentence. Thus, the correct answer is battle.
experience pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people caught in severe weather and losing their balance while traveling are likely to experience a physical trauma, which can be painful. Killing each other or drinking are unrelated to the context of the sentence, while talking to each other and thanking God may not be applicable since the sentence focuses on the physical effects of severe weather.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific place where young people are required to follow rules during the day. The option "everything" is too broad and not specific to a physical location. Similarly, "family situation" does not fit the context of the sentence which refers to a location. While it is important for young people to follow rules during a football game, this only applies to the duration of the game, not necessarily the entire day. A school bus is only relevant during transportation to and from school. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the location where young people spend the majority of their day, which is almost always the classroom.
living thing | Knowledge: The question is asking for a general category that an injury can happen to. Among the options provided, only "living thing" encompasses all possible objects that can experience an injury, including humans, animals, and plants. The other options are all specific locations or body parts where an injury can be treated or occur, but not all-encompassing like "living thing."
brain | Knowledge: Meningitis is an infection that affects the lining of the brain and spinal cord. This infection can cause inflammation of the brain, which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. None of the other options have any connection to meningitis or its symptoms.
scars | Knowledge: Suicide attempts can leave physical scars on the body, such as self-inflicted wounds. Therefore, checking for scars is one way to determine if someone has attempted suicide. The other choices are emotional states or actions associated with suicide but do not necessarily provide physical evidence of an attempt.
home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pilot has completed their work and is looking for a place to go afterwards. The options "cockpit" and "airplane" are both related to work and not appropriate for the context of the sentence. "Shower" could be an option, but it is unlikely to be the correct answer as it is too specific and not commonly associated with a pilot's routine. "Airport" is a possibility, but it is not the most appropriate answer as the pilot may be looking to leave the airport after work. "Home" is the most likely answer as it is a place where people usually go after they have finished their work.
ymca | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was in a location where people were focused on exercise and that it was likely a community or public place. Resort hotels may have pools, but the tone of the sentence suggests that the focus was exercise rather than leisurely activities. California and school do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Kitchen is an unlikely location for a swimming pool. The YMCA, on the other hand, is a community organization that often provides recreational facilities, including swimming pools, for its members who are interested in fitness and exercise.
hard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the air conditioner was not functioning properly, and despite adjusting the dial to a lower setting, it continued to blow something. The word "hard" suggests that the airflow was strong or forceful, which could be a sign of a faulty air conditioning unit. The other options do not provide any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
Disneyland | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that California is known for sunshine and a specific theme park. Disneyland is a famous theme park located in California, making it the only relevant option among the choices. The other options have no clear connection to the topic of California or theme parks.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person felt embarrassed or ashamed after making a loud noise by shutting a door, and would therefore blush or put their head down. The most likely place for this scenario to occur would be in a residential setting, such as an apartment or neighbor's house. The other options (wall, library, theater) do not provide a clear context for the scenario described in the sentence.
warmth | Knowledge: The question is asking about how to raise body temperature when it's chilly at night outdoors. This suggests that the goal is to feel warmer in the cold environment. The option "warmth" directly relates to this goal and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not provide a solution to the problem stated in the question. "Go to jail" is completely unrelated, "sleepover" could potentially provide warmth but doesn't directly address the issue of raising body temperature when chilly, and "burns" and "damage" are not safe or effective methods of raising body temperature.
office supply store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John needs a new appointment book, and that he doesn't want to search for the one he lost. Therefore, he would need to go to a place where he can purchase a new appointment book. The best option that fits this description is an office supply store, where one can generally buy various types of appointment books. The other options are not relevant because they are either places where he has already looked for the lost book (his house, pocket), or places where he wouldn't typically find an appointment book (doctor's office, handbag).
bedroom  | Knowledge: Placing a side chair in a bedroom is a common practice to aid in putting on or taking off shoes. This is because people often sit down to remove or put on their shoes, and a side chair provides a convenient place to do so. The other options - library, table, and office - do not typically involve shoe removal or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
lightning | Knowledge: Thunder is often associated with lightning because it is the result of the atmospheric disturbance caused by a lightning bolt. Lightning is a discharge of electricity that occurs during a thunderstorm and produces a bright flash of light, high temperature, and a loud noise. None of the other options are directly connected to thunder. "Quit" and "silence" are unlikely answers because thunder is a natural occurrence that generally cannot be stopped or silenced. "Lighting" and "lightening" are misspellings of lightning and do not fit the context of the question.
wallet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is asking about a small and portable item that can hold stamps while traveling. A wallet is a common item used to hold important documents and small items while on the go, making it the most logical choice. The other options, such as a suitcase or cabinet, are not practical for holding something as small as stamps while traveling. A desk or drawer are also unlikely options since they are not typically available while traveling.
drowsiness or rest | Knowledge: Going to bed typically indicates a desire to rest or sleep, so options like rest and drowsiness would make sense. Making love and pregnancy are not necessarily related to going to bed, while sleeping in suggests a choice to stay in bed longer rather than actually going to bed.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: The question is asking where one would find shirts with their favorite team's logo, which suggests that the shirts would be related to sports or a specific team. The most logical place to find such shirts would be a sporting goods store or a store that specializes in merchandise related to sports teams, as they are likely to carry a wide range of team-specific apparel. The other options do not have any clear connection to sports or team merchandise.
tetrahedron | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has four equal sides and a smooth surface. This is commonly associated with a tetrahedron, which is a geometric shape with four triangular faces. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
essential | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe believed that the task in question was important and could not be avoided, despite Sam's reluctance. The other options may imply a level of importance, but essential is the most fitting choice as it implies that the task is crucial and cannot be ignored.
despair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having faith in a higher power can provide comfort during difficult times. The phrase "provide solace" means to offer comfort or relief, and "times of despair" refer to moments of extreme sadness or hopelessness. The other options, such as "move mountains," "uneducated," "disbelief," and "knowledge," do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide any insight into what faith can provide during tough times.
economic instability | Knowledge: The sentence implies that inflation can lead to something negative that those in power are trying to prevent. Economic instability is a common consequence of inflation, as it can lead to a decrease in the value of money and result in unemployment, decreased production, and a decrease in consumer spending. War and rising interest rates are not directly related to inflation, while "not noticeable" and "problems" are too vague to be the correct answer.
It depends on the competition or event being referred to in the context. | Knowledge: The sentence alone does not provide enough context to determine what event or competition is being referred to, or what the best horse in the world might win. It is important to consider the surrounding text or conversation to gather more information and make an informed choice. The choices given provide a range of possibilities, but without more context, it is impossible to determine the correct answer.
beach | Knowledge: Sunblock is typically used to protect bare skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. The context of the question implies that the person may be spending time outside in a sunny location, and the choices suggest various outdoor environments. However, only the beach is a location where a person is likely to be exposed to direct sunlight and have bare skin that needs protection from sunburn. The other options may be outdoors, but they do not have the same connection to sun exposure as the beach.
stomachache | Knowledge: Overindulging when eating breakfast can lead to discomfort in the stomach, which is commonly referred to as a stomachache. Gas and indigestion can also occur, but may not be as commonly associated with overeating at breakfast. Fullness may be a symptom, but not necessarily a negative one. Gain energy is unlikely to be the correct answer as overeating can lead to feeling sluggish rather than energized.
hurt | Knowledge: The question implies that something negative happened to the boy, causing him to cry. "Hurt" is the most straightforward answer as it indicates physical or emotional pain. "Acting" and "make happy" do not fit the context of the question, while "miserable" implies a general feeling of sadness rather than a specific event. "Got injured" is a possible alternative, but "hurt" is a more general term that can encompass various types of injuries or pain.
treated with respect | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is asking about a desire or need that a person may have in their workplace. Out of the options provided, only "treated with respect" seems relevant to a work environment. It is common for employees to desire respect from their colleagues and superiors, as it can contribute to a positive and productive work environment. The other options, such as owning a house, having an easy life, or having healthy children, do not directly relate to the topic of work. A recurring headache may be a negative consequence of a stressful work environment, but it is not something that a person would actively want.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence states that the child is going to play, which implies that they will likely experience enjoyment and have fun. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Sleepy" suggests the opposite of being active and playing, "rush" implies urgency or stress, and "meet" suggests a social interaction rather than a solitary activity like playing.
exhaust pipe | Knowledge: Placing a potato in an exhaust pipe can cause an explosion due to the build-up of pressure and heat in the pipe. The starch in the potato can also ignite and cause a fire. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
bells and whistles | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Bob is looking for a high-quality stereo system with advanced features, which are commonly referred to as "bells and whistles." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as decorative and extravagant do not relate to the functionality of the stereo system, while speakers and exotic are too general and do not convey the specific qualities that Bob is looking for.
breathe | Knowledge: Breathing is a basic biological function that is necessary for survival, and therefore, it is essential for living life. The other options such as death, money, and growing older are either antonyms or not relevant to the context of the question. While experiencing things is important to living life, it is not a necessary prerequisite for it.
serve customers | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person's first job was waiting tables, which involves serving customers. The other options may be related to the job of a waiter/waitress, but the sentence specifically mentions "wait tables" and "reminiscing about the simple task," which suggests that the answer is related to the basic responsibilities of a server.
western movie | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something involved the use of more than one horse, which is a common trope in Western movies where horses are often used for transportation or in scenes of action and chase. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bored | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the prisoners played cards as a way to pass the time and avoid feeling bored while confined. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Afraid" does not make sense because there is no mention of fear, and "have fun" and "winning" are mentioned as reasons to play cards, not ways to avoid anything. "Good at" is not relevant because the sentence is not discussing skill level, but rather the activity itself.
witty | Knowledge: The phrase "a good sense of humor" implies someone who is able to make others laugh, which is a trait commonly associated with being witty. Witty individuals are often quick with clever remarks and jokes, which can make them highly entertaining and enjoyable to be around. The other options do not accurately describe someone who is good at making others laugh.
dense forest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fox was lost in a place with many trees, which is a characteristic commonly associated with dense forests. Dense forests are known to be difficult to navigate due to the abundance of trees and underbrush, which may explain why the fox was lost. The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence.
insubstantial | Knowledge: The word "massive" typically refers to something that is large and heavy. Therefore, the opposite of "massive" would be something that is small or light, and "insubstantial" fits this description. "Dwarf" is a word used to describe someone who is unusually small, while "massless" refers to something that lacks mass altogether. "Inconsequential" suggests something that is unimportant or insignificant, and "lame" typically means something that is weak or ineffective.
telephone | Knowledge: The word "mouthpiece" is commonly associated with the telephone, as it refers to the part of the telephone receiver that you speak into. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backyard | Knowledge: Since the question is about raising vegetables, it suggests that the shed would be used for gardening tools and storage. Therefore, it is more likely to be located in a backyard where the vegetable garden is situated. The other options do not necessarily have any connection to vegetable gardening or storage. A farm yard or a ranch may have a larger shed for storing farm equipment or animal feed, while a coalshed is specifically designed for storing coal.
national park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people want to take a break or enjoy themselves, which is usually associated with vacation. National parks are known tourist destinations famous for being scenic and adventurous, hence making them popular vacation spots. The other options (confession, vehicles, supermarket, and school) are not related to vacationing.
middle of town | Knowledge: The question implies that the gallery should be located in a place that is equidistant from everyone, which suggests a central or middle location within the town. The options of downtown area or large city may be too specific and do not necessarily guarantee equal distance from everyone. The options of London and lot of people do not provide any insight into where the gallery should be located.
use soap | Knowledge: The sentence clearly suggests that washing hands is important, and that the process involves wetting, using something, and then rinsing. The options "thinking," "irritation," and "cleaning hands after autopsy" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, using soap is a common and important step in hand washing, as it helps to remove dirt, germs, and other contaminants from the hands. Therefore, "use soap" is the correct answer.
underwater | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the use of scuba gear, which is typically used for diving underwater. The other options, such as beach and waterfalls, do not require the use of scuba gear to be experienced. Additionally, the word "ocean" in the sentence suggests an aquatic environment, further emphasizing the correct answer of underwater.
wait in line | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific action that elementary school students must do when going into class. Waiting in line is a common practice in schools, especially at the beginning of the day or after recess. This ensures that students enter the classroom orderly, and the teacher can keep track of who has arrived. Thinking for oneself and answering questions are academic skills that students learn, but they are not directly related to entering the classroom. Speaking a foreign language may be a skill taught in some schools, but it is not mentioned in the sentence. Crossing the road is also not a relevant option as it is not mentioned in the context of the sentence.
forked tongue | Knowledge: Snakes are a type of reptile, which means they share many characteristics with other reptiles such as turtles and lizards. However, one of the most distinctive features that separates snakes from other reptiles is their forked tongue. This tongue helps them detect prey and navigate their surroundings. The other choices might be true of some reptiles, but none of them are a clear characteristic of snakes.
relax | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James turned on the television to find a show after a long day of work. This suggests that he wanted to unwind and relax. The other options all imply that James was going to sleep, which is not necessarily indicated by the sentence. Additionally, the option "lay down" is not a valid answer on its own since it doesn't imply any specific action or outcome.
sweating | Knowledge: Jumping rope is a form of cardiovascular exercise that is known to increase heart rate and cause sweating. Sweating is a natural response of the body to cool it down during exercise. Ankle sprain, looking silly, and winning are unrelated effects of jumping rope, while becoming tired may be a common effect of any form of exercise, including jumping rope.
hangovers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that celebrating by drinking too much is likely to have negative consequences. One common consequence of excessive drinking is experiencing a hangover the following day, which is characterized by headache, fatigue, nausea, and other unpleasant symptoms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laundromat | Knowledge: A laundromat is a place where people can pay to use multiple washing machines simultaneously, making it the most likely answer to the question. A house, communal laundry, or cellar may have multiple machines, but using more than one at a time would be less common. "Wash clothes" is not a place where machines would be used, but rather an activity that would be done using a washing machine.
learn from each other | Knowledge: The question is asking about the best way to have a conversation, implying that there is a desired outcome or goal. Learning from each other is a common objective of conversation, as it allows for the exchange of ideas and information. Facing each other is important for effective communication and connection, but it is not necessarily the main goal of a conversation. Enjoying oneself or grouping together may also be desirable, but they are not necessarily key to having a successful conversation. Call each other is also not relevant, as it refers to the act of initiating a conversation, rather than how to have it.
wet things | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the rain is affecting things that were left outside. "Wet things" is the most accurate choice since it covers a broad range of objects that can get wet in the rain. "Wet ground" and "wet soil" are not wrong, but they only describe the ground condition rather than what happens to objects left outside. "Start to fall" and "grow" do not make sense in this context.
triple crown | Knowledge: The Triple Crown is a series of three prestigious horse races (Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes) that a horse must win in order to achieve this championship goal. The other options do not relate to horse racing or a championship goal.
quit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's injury would prevent him from continuing to learn and play the game. "Quit" is the logical choice because if he cannot continue due to his injury, he would have no other option but to stop trying. "Improved performance," "forget," and "teach" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Michigan" is also unrelated and does not provide any helpful information.
impatience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was in a hurry and running late, which would likely make him feel impatient as he entered his workplace. Impatience is a common emotion felt when one is in a hurry or rushing to get somewhere. The other options do not accurately reflect John's likely emotional state in this situation.
heavy | Knowledge: The context suggests that John needed help with something that was physically heavy. The other options are all related to emotions or attitudes and do not fit the context of the sentence.
kitchen | Knowledge: The sentence implies that mixing things on a counter is a common activity that takes place in a specific location. The most logical place for this activity to occur is in a kitchen, where food preparation often takes place. The other options, such as a candy store or post office, do not have any clear connection to mixing things on a counter.
firm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the father wanted his son to be tough and resilient, and the word "soft" implies weakness or lack of endurance. The word "firm" is commonly used to describe a strict or uncompromising attitude, which could indicate that the father was strict with his son in order to toughen him up. The other options, such as sandpaper and abrasive, imply roughness or unpleasantness, which is not necessarily what the father was trying to do.
cow | Knowledge: The question suggests that the milk needs to be poured into a container cup, which indicates that it is not already in a container. Out of the given choices, milk is most likely to come out of a cow. A dispenser usually refers to a machine that dispenses pre-packaged liquids, such as soda, rather than fresh milk. Milk would not naturally be in a person's hand or a kitchen cupboard, and it is unlikely that it would be stored in a refrigerator without a container.
public place | Knowledge: The word "demonstration" usually refers to a public display of protest or advocacy. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the people would choose a public place as their location for this activity. The other options do not make sense in the context of a demonstration. A supermarket and demolition are not appropriate for this kind of event, a space shuttle is unlikely to be the location of a demonstration, and a roadblock would be more of an obstruction than a venue for a public display.
car | Knowledge: The question is asking about where to keep an eyeglasses case specifically while in traffic, which suggests that the answer will relate to a location within a vehicle. The option "car" is the most logical choice, as it implies that the case should be kept somewhere easily accessible within the car while driving. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
become full | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject has already eaten a full meal and exercised, which would likely lead to a feeling of satiety or fullness. The other options - becoming tired, experiencing indigestion or flatulence, or becoming intoxicated - do not logically follow from the information given in the sentence.
eat eggs | Knowledge: Eating breakfast is often considered to be an early morning activity, and eggs are a common breakfast food. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
aquarium | Knowledge: Blowfish are not typically sold in pet shops or fish markets because they contain a poisonous toxin, which requires specialized handling and preparation. The Little Mermaid is a fictional character and not a place where a blowfish could be kept. The great outdoors is not an environment where blowfish could survive, as they are typically found in saltwater oceans. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an aquarium, where blowfish can be safely kept and observed by visitors.
four legs | Knowledge: Most mammals have four legs as their primary mode of movement. While cats do possess whiskers, sharp teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes glowing eyes, not all mammals share these characteristics. Therefore, four legs is the most common characteristic that cats share with most mammals.
universe | Knowledge: Light is a physical phenomenon that can be defined as the electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves throughout space. This radiation can originate from many sources, but in the context of the question, the most relevant answer is the universe. This is because stars and other celestial objects emit light that can travel vast distances through space before reaching the Earth. The other options have no connection to the scientific explanation of light.
email | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person opened up the advertisement after reading the subject line, suggesting that the ad was sent through a digital medium. The options "mail" and "magazine" suggest physical forms of advertisement, while "la ville" is not a common advertising platform in English. "Web page" could be a possibility, but the mention of "opening up" points more towards an email.
whistle | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone might be daydreaming while standing in a queue and not paying attention to their surroundings. To get their attention from far away, the person might use a distinctive sound, such as whistling, to stand out from the background noise. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
aeroplane (or airplane) | Knowledge: The sentence emphasizes the importance of the cargo, indicating that it needed to be delivered quickly. The means of delivery mentioned are all transportation methods, but only airplanes are known for their speed and ability to quickly transport goods over long distances. Therefore, aeroplane or airplane is the most likely correct answer. The other options, such as boats or ferries, may be slower or not as well-suited for long-distance deliveries.
waterfall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is creating a pond in their backyard with multiple levels, and they used flat rocks to create a connection between the levels. Waterfalls are often used in landscaping to create a visually appealing and calming water feature, and the use of flat rock to create a connection between the levels suggests that the person is creating a waterfall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rainforest | Knowledge: Marmosets are a type of monkey that is native to the rainforest. Zoos usually have exhibits that replicate the natural environment of the animals they house, so it is likely that if a zoo has marmosets, they would be found in an exhibit that simulates a rainforest habitat. The other options are unlikely to be places where a marmoset would be found, either because they are not native habitats or because they are not relevant in any way to the question.
Plug in | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to the process of setting up a television to watch cable. In this context, "plug in" makes the most sense as it suggests connecting the cord from the cable box to the television. "Kill," "switch on," "sit on couch," and "open eyes" do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make sense for setting up a television to watch cable.
become adults | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something will happen to kids if they experience aging. Aging is a natural process of growing older and becoming more mature, which is often associated with becoming an adult. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that if kids experience aging, they will eventually become adults. The other choices do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
talking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the college freshman wanted to make friends, which requires some form of social interaction. Among the choices provided, "talking" is the most logical answer as it is the most common way people interact and get know each other. "Smiling" and being "nice to" others may also help in making friends, but are not as active as "talking." "Farting" and "falling in love" are not appropriate options as they do not relate to the context of the sentence.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: Typically, toothpaste is stored in a place where it can be easily accessed when needed for oral hygiene. The bathroom is a common location for storing toothpaste because it provides easy access to a sink for brushing teeth. The living room and suitcase options are unlikely choices since they are not typically associated with oral care. The mouth is not a storage location, and therefore an incorrect option. The medicine cabinet is a logical option since it is a compartment in the bathroom that is specifically designed for storing health and hygiene products, including toothpaste.
meeting hall | Knowledge: The use of the term "holding chair" suggests that Brother Dan was in a meeting or gathering of some sort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
shopping spree | Knowledge: The phrase "ends with a cash register" suggests a type of activity where purchases are made and payment is processed. A shopping spree is typically associated with going on a spending spree and making multiple purchases, often ending at a cash register to pay for the items. The other options may involve making purchases but do not necessarily end at a cash register, such as browsing in a bookstore or playing with toys in a toy store.
truthful | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the witnesses had to take an oath, implying that they were going to be providing some sort of testimony or statement. The purpose of an oath is typically to ensure that the witness is telling the truth, so it is logical to assume that the oath would require the witness to be truthful. The other options do not relate to the concept of an oath in this context.
grass | Knowledge: Front yards are typically outdoor spaces in residential areas that are used for decorative and recreational purposes. Grass is commonly found in front yards as it provides a soft, lush, and inviting look. Other options such as neighborhood, playhouse, barbeques, and suburb do not make sense in the context of the question.
insignificant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a significant event in someone's life is not something that can be easily ignored or considered insignificant. The options "ignorable," "negligible," and "slight" all imply a lack of importance, while "saint" is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, "insignificant" is the correct choice as it contrasts with the idea of a significant event.
correct | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a condition for getting credit while answering questions. This condition is that the answer must be correct. In contrast, the other options do not seem to relate to a condition for receiving credit while answering questions. Teaching is a separate activity from answering questions, satisfaction is a subjective feeling that does not relate to a condition for receiving credit, and discussion and clear are not mentioned in the context of the sentence.
discipline | Knowledge: The sentence implies that exercising daily is not an easy task and requires a lot of mental strength. Discipline is a trait that helps one stay committed to a routine or goal, which is necessary for exercising regularly. Effort and exercise are related to physical activity and do not necessarily describe the mental aspect of maintaining a daily exercise routine. Muscles and run are more specific to running and do not apply to all forms of exercise.
better | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people who follow God are associated with a positive attribute. The word "better" suggests that following God leads to a better lifestyle or a better character. The other options, such as "devil" and "satan," are completely opposite to what someone following God would be associated with. "Dog" and "mortal" are neutral options that do not relate to the context of the sentence.
business district | Knowledge: A post office is typically located in a busy commercial area, such as a business district, because it needs to be easily accessible to a large number of people. The center of town and building are too broad and do not provide enough information to answer the question. The mail room is a specific location inside a building and not a likely place to find a large post office. The term "population center" is not typically used to describe a specific location for a post office.
bar | Knowledge: The term "alcoholic refreshment" implies the serving of alcoholic drinks, which is a common practice in bars. Even though some churches may serve wine during religious services, it is not typically referred to as an "alcoholic refreshment." Similarly, homeless shelters and prisons do not offer alcoholic drinks due to their regulations and policies. Parks are public spaces and typically do not allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
blue | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a large body of water has a visual characteristic that is commonly associated with a particular color. Blue is a common color associated with water, as it is often the color of the sky reflecting off the surface of the water or the result of light being absorbed and reflected by the water molecules. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bake bread | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker wants to make a sandwich that includes peanut butter and jelly. The correct answer, therefore, should be a food item that can be used as bread. The option "bake bread" is appropriate because it involves making a type of bread that can be sliced and used as a base for the sandwich. The other options are not relevant to making a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly.
capital city | Knowledge: The location of the supreme courthouse in a state is typically in the capital city. This is where the state government and legislative branches are located, and where important decisions and laws are made. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
think about | Knowledge: The phrase "analyse a subject" suggests that a deep and thorough examination is required. The phrase "at great length" further emphasizes the need for extensive thinking and consideration. The options "use calculator" and "learn new" do not relate to the concept of analysis. "Look at" and "come to a conclusion" may be part of the process of analysis, but they do not encompass the entirety of the process. Therefore, "think about" is the best answer choice.
encourage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher believed John could do better and that she attempted to help him reach his potential. Of the given choices, "encourage" is the most likely action a teacher would take to motivate a student to improve. The other options would not necessarily help a student perform better, and some may even be counterproductive. For example, lowering expectations or bribing a student may discourage them further, while timing a test has no connection to helping a student improve performance. Telling a story may be beneficial in some circumstances, but it does not directly relate to helping a student reach their potential.
England | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the country the koala was in also speaks English, which narrows down the options to England or another English-speaking country. However, the fact that the koala is far from home and across the ocean from Australia implies that it is not in a neighboring country like New Zealand. The option "gum tree" is a red herring, as gum trees are native to Australia and not a location. "Great outdoors" and "jungle" are also unlikely options for a koala, as they are typically found in eucalyptus forests. The San Diego Zoo is located in the United States, which speaks English but is not across the ocean from Australia. Therefore, England is the most likely answer.
school | Knowledge: The sentence describes a former wrestler who is giving back, suggesting that they are likely donating something related to wrestling. The specific mention of a "main wrestling mat" further supports this idea. The other options, such as bathroom or living room, do not make sense in the context of wrestling. The mention of "public" is too vague and does not provide enough information to determine the correct answer.
buying | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person likes to read newspapers regularly, which would require a subscription. A subscription is a payment made to receive regular copies of a publication, such as a newspaper or magazine. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. "Gifting" and "money" are not related to the person's enjoyment of reading newspapers, and "literacy" and "knowing how to read" do not fit with the idea of a subscription.
antique store | Knowledge: The phrase "old coffee table book" suggests that the book is likely to be a vintage or antique item, which would increase the likelihood of it being found in an antique store. Antique stores specialize in selling old and rare items, such as vintage books, furniture, and decorative items. The other options do not have the same association with vintage or antique goods.
soup | Knowledge: Bald eagles are birds of prey that typically live in mountainous areas near bodies of water. They are unlikely to avoid these areas, as they rely on them for food and nesting. In Washington, bald eagles are actually quite common and can be found near rivers and lakes. Nature preserves may also be a suitable habitat for bald eagles. Trees are also important for bald eagles, as they build their nests in them. However, soup is not a natural habitat for bald eagles and they would not be likely to encounter it or have any reason to avoid it.
distinct | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite the drawing of the object being unclear or vague, the people playing the drawing game were still able to identify it. This suggests that the item had some unique or specific characteristics that made it stand out or distinguishable from other objects. The word "distinct" means unique, separate, or easily recognizable, which fits this context well. The other options do not necessarily imply anything unique or specific about the object.
avoid | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that punishing physical jobs have a negative impact on people's desire to exercise. Therefore, it is likely that people will want to avoid exercise due to the physical strain that their jobs put on their bodies. The other options (procrastinate, yell at, being nasty, ignore) do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
beach | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the area of land being referred to is adjacent to the ocean, which is a defining characteristic of a beach. Beaches are commonly seen as sand or pebbles adjacent to water bodies, which is why it makes the most sense among the options given. The other choices - underwater, surface of earth, waterfalls, delta - do not refer to land adjacent to the ocean.
dentist | Knowledge: A cavity is a small hole or decay in a tooth that needs to be filled to prevent further damage. Fillings are typically done by a dentist who specializes in oral health and hygiene. While doctors may have a basic understanding of dental health, they are not typically trained in filling cavities. The other options may be related to dental health, but only "dentist" specifically refers to a professional who would perform a cavity filling.
going somewhere | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the subject is engaged in an activity that typically involves movement from one place to another, which is going somewhere. The other options are not contextually appropriate and do not describe activities usually associated with traveling.
entertained | Knowledge: The word "gossip" implies that the magazines in question are likely focused on celebrities and their personal lives. As such, the main reason people read them is likely for entertainment purposes, as they are interested in the drama and scandal that can be found within. The other options do not fit the context of gossip magazines.
countryside | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the runner chose to exercise in a natural setting (the forest) over an urban one (the city), so it's reasonable to assume he would prefer to drive to a location with similar characteristics. The countryside is a term used to describe rural areas outside of cities, and it is often associated with natural landscapes and outdoor activities. The other options (with the exception of temperate zone, which refers to a climate region) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pond | Knowledge: The activity of skipping pebbles suggests that the child was near a body of water, and a pond is a common location for this type of activity. The other options - street, playground, parking lot, and aquarium - do not fit the context of the sentence or the activity being described.
race track | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the gamblers are watching animals with four legs, which is commonly associated with horse races. The most common place to watch horse races and place bets is at a race track. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
kindergarten class | Knowledge: Kindergarten is a common pre-primary education program for young children typically around the ages of three to five years. It is often viewed as a preparatory stage before starting primary school. The other options such as university and high school are not relevant as they come after primary school. The choice "every aspect of life" is too general and does not provide any context for the question. Class room could refer to any level of education, so it is not specific enough.
market | Knowledge: The sentence implies that fresh fruit can be obtained from a specific location. Sand, San Francisco, trees, and refrigerators do not seem to be related to the context of fresh fruit, while markets are known to sell fresh produce including fruits. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "market."
talk to each other | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that James believes people need to communicate more, which implies that people are not talking to each other enough. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are clearly irrelevant.
can | Knowledge: Green beans are often canned as a preservation method, so this would be the most logical option for where to put them if a person wants to store them for future use. The other options (plate, mouth, spoon, farmer's market) are not related to preserving or storing green beans.
separate people | Knowledge: The use of the word "can't agree" in the question implies that there is a disagreement or conflict between the two individuals. The word "fear" suggests that this disagreement may have arisen due to a stressful or threatening situation. Given this context, it is likely that the individuals would want to separate from each other in order to minimize their exposure to the stressor and reduce their feelings of fear. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the question.
temporary | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was looking for a way to permanently stop the Crimson King but could only find a temporary solution. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Transient" could be a possible contender, but "temporary" is a better fit since it specifically refers to a solution that is not long-lasting.
bedroom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that John is searching for a lamp in a dark environment, and the specific reference to "everything" being dark suggests that he is likely in a room or enclosed space. Of the choices given, "bedroom" is the only option that fits this description. The other options do not provide any context clues that would help us determine whether they could be the correct answer.
repair shop | Knowledge: When a car is involved in an accident, it will likely need repairs to fix any damage sustained during the collision. Repair shops specialize in repairing cars and are equipped to handle a variety of issues, making this the most logical answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of a car accident.
skill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that practice is beneficial for improving one's abilities in playing chess. While all of the options may be related to playing chess in some way, "skill" is the most direct connection to the context of the sentence. Chess is often considered a game of skill, involving strategic thinking and problem-solving, which can be improved with practice. The other options are either unrelated or do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
draw attention to themselves | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is vain, which means they have a high opinion of themselves and crave attention. Among the options given, only "draw attention to themselves" fits this description. The other options, such as "come home" and "catch cold," do not fit the context of the sentence and do not demonstrate vanity.
solve problems | Knowledge: The word "competent" suggests that the person is skilled and capable of performing their job duties effectively. "Solve problems" is a common attribute of competent employees as they are able to anticipate and respond to challenges and make decisions to overcome them. The other options do not directly relate to the idea of being competent in the workplace.
close eyes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing strain from being in front of a computer all day and needs to rest. Closing the eyes can help to reduce strain on the eyes and also promote relaxation. Sitting down and relaxing can be helpful, but closing the eyes is a specific action that is mentioned in the sentence. Sleeping and having dreams may not be practical options in the middle of the day.
bar | Knowledge: In a bar or pub setting, it's common for each booth or table to have its own personal television for patrons to watch while they socialize or enjoy a drink. This option is the only one that specifically mentions a location where people might gather socially and be entertained, while the other options do not suggest the presence of television sets.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people who delay getting a check-up may be motivated to change their behavior if they experience pain. Pain is a common and powerful motivator for seeking medical attention or making lifestyle changes, and it is likely to be a more convincing reason to address one's health concerns than simply feeling anxious, uncertain, or experiencing supposed good hindsight. Trouble could be a possible reason for someone to change their behavior, but it is not as clear in this context whether it refers to health trouble or other types of problems.
kiss | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a relationship between love and physical affection towards someone. Kissing is a common expression of affection in romantic relationships, whereas the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
solar system | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "exploring" and "galaxy," which suggests that the question is related to space travel. The term "solar system" refers to our own planetary system, and it is the logical first destination for human explorers who want to venture into space. The other options, like "airport" or "food court," are not related to space exploration and would not make sense as answers to this question.
pantry | Knowledge: Rice is a staple food item that is usually stored in a pantry or cupboard. It is generally not stored in a refrigerator or closet, and would not be found in a pot unless it was being cooked. Kitchen is a general term that does not provide enough specific information. Therefore, the most likely answer is the pantry.
understanding | Knowledge: The sentence implies that attending the meeting was important to the person, and getting a good "understanding" suggests that they were focused on learning and gaining knowledge from the meeting. "Start," "getting information," and "result" are not necessarily related to the purpose of attending a meeting, and "falling asleep" is the opposite of being attentive and engaged.
better grade | Knowledge: Practicing answering questions can lead to an increase in knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, which can result in improved test scores and grades. It can also help build good study habits, such as time management and organization, which are essential for academic success. The other options do not relate to the potential benefits of practicing answering questions.
northern hemisphere | Knowledge: The statement indicates that North America has winter at the beginning of the year, which suggests that it is in the northern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere experiences winter at the beginning of the year due to the earth's axial tilt, which causes the hemisphere to be tilted away from the sun during that time. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why North America has winter at the beginning of the year.
louisiana | Knowledge: Louisiana is a coastal state in the southern United States that is known for its seafood cuisine, including crab dishes. South Carolina is also a coastal state, but its cuisine is more centered around shrimp and grits. New England and Maine are located in the northeastern part of the country and are known for their lobster, not crab. Chesapeake Bay, located on the east coast, is known for its blue crabs, but it is not part of the southern United States.
opera house | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "getting dressed very formally" and "stereotypical viewing glasses" suggest that the context is related to attending a formal event, likely a performance. The options of movie theaters and eye doctor don't fit this context. The option of auditorium might fit, but it is not as commonly associated with formal events as an opera house. And the option of "end of line" doesn't make sense in the context of attending a formal event. Therefore, the correct answer is opera house.
living longer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is careful about what he eats for dinner because he wants to experience something positive. Living longer is a likely choice since a healthy diet has been linked to increased longevity. The other options are all negative consequences of eating unhealthy food, which contradicts the context of the sentence.
state park | Knowledge: Hiking and taking pictures are activities commonly associated with nature and outdoor environments. State parks are often popular destinations for hiking and offer scenic views that are commonly photographed by tourists. The other options (New York, Disneyland, etc.) do not have any clear connection to hiking or nature. "Waterfall" and "beach" are closer choices to "state park," but they still lack the specificity of a particular location that would make them more likely to be the correct answer.
tennis racket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing tennis requires specific equipment, as well as an opponent and a ball. A tennis racket is the tool used to hit the ball over the net and score points, making it an essential item to play the game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sports stadium | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a large number of fans are entering a venue for a "big game." The options "sporting event," "hockey game," "soccer field," and "sports stadium" are all related to the context of the sentence, but the phrase "it wouldn't be long before what was filled" specifically suggests that the venue itself will be filled soon. A "hot room" is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "sports stadium."
ignore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the recipient did not respond to the sender's request or plea, indicating that they chose to ignore the email. None of the other options suggest a lack of response, except for "question," which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Print the email," "ask," and "forward" all involve some sort of action in response to the email, while "ignore" indicates a lack of action.
arcade | Knowledge: The mention of a toy that fires a projectile ball and coin operated machines suggests that the location being referred to is an arcade. Arcades are known for having various games that require players to insert coins to operate and often involve shooting projectiles. The other options, such as a tennis court or baseball thrower, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah used to smoke cigarettes but has quit and now takes long drives instead. The purpose of these drives is likely to substitute for the pleasure she used to get from smoking. Therefore, she is likely taking the drives to relax and enjoy the experience, rather than to get somewhere or take a break. "Smoke" is not a reasonable answer as the sentence indicates that she has quit smoking. "Wreak" is also not a reasonable answer, as it does not fit the context of the sentence.
cupboard | Knowledge: Tin is a common material for food storage containers, such as cookie tins or tea tins. In the context of the question, the most likely place for a tin with food would be in a cupboard, which is a common location for storing food items in a household. The other options, such as hardware store or antique store, are unlikely to have food items stored in tins.
please parents | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject may be attempting to win over the approval or acceptance of parents, which is often associated with success in their eyes. The other options, such as taking an oath or procreating, do not have clear connections to the context of the sentence. Kissing may be a form of showing affection or love, but it does not necessarily relate to the idea of pleasing parents.
toy store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James wants to buy a kite, which is a toy that can be flown in the sky. Therefore, the most logical place to look for a kite would be a toy store which sells toys and games for children and adults to enjoy. The other options, such as a child's hand, the sky, under a cabbage, or at the end of the line, do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are not relevant to finding a kite.
painful memories | Knowledge: The phrase "lost long ago" indicates that the artifacts were of personal significance to the archaeologist, possibly something that he had discovered or collected in the past. The fact that he is "seeing" these artifacts while reading a textbook suggests that he may be reminded of the circumstances surrounding their loss, which could potentially bring up painful memories. The other answer choices, such as poor planning or anger, do not align with the emotional tone of the sentence.
change strategies | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the company operates in a vertical structure, which means that decision-making power is concentrated at the top of the organization. To make it more horizontal, the company would need to adopt a flatter organizational structure where decision-making power is distributed among different levels of the hierarchy. This would involve changing strategies to empower employees, creating cross-functional teams, and encouraging collaboration. The other options are not relevant or appropriate for making a company more horizontal.
opera | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the confusion may be related to language barriers, as French and Italian are both Romance languages. The option "opera" also makes sense as it is a performance art form that often features singing in foreign languages. The options "class," "war," and "mind" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Spanish" may be a distractor, as it is also a Romance language, but it is not mentioned in the sentence and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
hurt people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bully's words had a negative impact on others. The option "hurt people" aligns with this idea and is the most appropriate choice. The option "mean many things" is a vague and unclear choice. "Hurtful" is an adjective that describes the nature of the words, but doesn't convey the impact on others. "Ring true" suggests that the bully's words were accurate or truthful, which contradicts the idea of them being mean. "Fighting" is not a valid option as it doesn't relate to the effect of the bully's words on others.
mass | Knowledge: Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², states that energy (E) is related to mass (m) and the speed of light squared (c²). This theory revolutionized our understanding of physics and is one of the most well-known equations in science. The other answer choices, such as sports, weakness, and lazy, have no connection to the context of the question or to Einstein's work.
ham sandwich | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the employee was taking an order for a sandwich, and specifically asked about the choice of meat and bread. The choice "ham sandwich" is the most logical answer, as it directly relates to the context. The other options, such as "fork," "freezer," "frying pan," and "oven," do not make sense in this particular sentence.
opera | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was intentionally avoiding listening to people singing all night, which is a common feature of an opera. Operas are known for being long performances that involve singing, and sometimes Sam might not have been interested in attending an opera. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rock band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a desire to be part of a group that plays certain musical instruments, such as being a frontman or playing guitar. The option "rock band" is the most appropriate because it encompasses a genre of music that often features these roles, and would make the most sense contextually. The other options do not have any connection to the sentence, and are unlikely to be accurate answers.
golf course | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Billy was searching for a hole, which suggests that he might have been looking for a hole on a golf course. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he scoured the place many times searching, which indicates that he was meticulously searching a large area. The other options (notebook paper, swiss cheese, doughnut, bagel) do not make sense in this context as they are not places that one would "scour" to look for a hole.
allergies | Knowledge: Pollen is a common trigger for allergies, which can cause symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and congestion. Cleaning a house from pollen can help reduce the amount of allergens in the air, which can improve the quality of life for those with allergies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of cleaning a house from pollen.
know everything | Knowledge: The use of the word "annoying" suggests that the person is likely sharing their opinions or comments in an intrusive or obnoxious way. The phrase "he must think" implies that this behavior is intentional, and the phrase "have a comment to share" suggests that the person has something to say about everything. These clues all point to the idea that the person may believe they know everything, which makes "know everything" the most likely answer choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
predetermination | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific term or concept being described, related to the belief that we do not have control over events in our lives. "Predetermination" is a commonly-used term to describe this idea, as it suggests that events and outcomes are predetermined and outside of our control. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hardware store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James needs a utilitarian item to wrap around his tires for added traction, which is typically not something you would find at a jewelry store or in the engine compartment of a car. A hardware store is a more likely option, as they carry a variety of chains for various purposes. A garage might also have some options, but it's not clear if James has access to a garage or if they would have the specific type of chain he needs. A gear shift is not related to his tire needs.
fall in love | Knowledge: The term "lover" often refers to someone who is in a romantic relationship with another person. The most common way to become a lover is by falling in love with someone. "Make love" is a physical act that can occur between two people who are in a romantic relationship, but it does not necessarily mean that they are lovers. "Wait forever" and "distance themselves" do not explain how someone becomes a lover. "Being dumped" refers to the end of a romantic relationship, which is the opposite of becoming a lover.
take trips | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people use their time off from work to engage in an activity that involves leaving their usual environment or daily routine. Taking trips is a common way for people to do this, as it allows them to explore new places, relax, and have fun. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - growing shorter and becoming hysterical are not typical activities that people do in their free time, learning from each other and talking to coworkers suggests that people are still in a work environment, rather than having time off.
increase knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence states that learning is difficult, arduous, and a long process, but in the end, it gives Sally something special. This suggests that the purpose of learning is to gain something valuable. One of the most common things people gain from learning is increased knowledge. The other options may be related to learning in some way, but they don't capture the essence of what learning does for someone.
desk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a ruler can be placed either on top of or into something. Among the choices given, only a desk has a surface onto which a ruler can be placed, or a groove or edge into which a ruler can fit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
window | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cats are peeking at birds, which means they are likely watching them outside. The most likely place for a cat to watch birds outside would be through a window. The other options such as the floor, ground, warm bed, and sand box do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
communication | Knowledge: Typing refers to the process of using a keyboard to input written text into a computer or other device. This written text can then be sent electronically, printed out, or otherwise communicated to another person or device. Therefore, typing is a form of communication. The other choices do not accurately describe typing, as it is not a conversation, printed word, or indeterminate activity.
outer space | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the satellite passed the moon, indicating that it was already in space. The only logical option among the choices then is outer space, which refers to the expanse beyond the Earth's atmosphere where satellites and other celestial bodies orbit. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence; the moon and the night sky are already established elements in the scene, while the universe is too broad a term to specify where the satellite was heading. Air, on the other hand, pertains to the Earth's atmosphere, which the sentence implies the satellite had already left behind.
hawaiian waters | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is looking for a location to hunt blowfish within America. While blowfish are typically found in tropical waters or the South Pacific, the mention of not wanting to leave America narrows down the choices to Hawaiian waters. Sushi stores and fish markets do not offer opportunities for hunting blowfish.
music store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person wants to purchase a trumpet to take home. Music stores are where musical instruments are often sold to customers, while marching bands, high school bands, and brass bands refer to groups of musicians who play together rather than places to buy instruments. A locker is a storage space, so it does not make sense in this context.
office space | Knowledge: The question is asking where salesmen typically work, and the answer would be the location where their primary job duties take place. While a salesman may interact with customers or clients at various locations such as a front door, car show, or shop, their base of operations is usually an office space. This is where they manage their sales activities, track their leads and deals, communicate with customers and colleagues, and perform other administrative tasks. The other options may involve sales-related activities, but they are not the primary work location for salesmen.
cast shadow | Knowledge: The wording of the question suggests that the answer should be something that can be hung on a building, which immediately rules out options like "grow" or "fall down." The phrase "cast shadow" makes sense in this context, as buildings can often create shadows depending on the position of the sun. The other options do not have any clear connection to the idea of hanging or impacting a building.
vacuuming | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the task involves removing dirt from a carpet, which is typically done using a vacuum cleaner. Brooms are more commonly used to sweep hard floors, while mops are used to clean floors with liquids. Effort and boredom are more general concepts that do not relate specifically to the task of cleaning a carpet.
swallowing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is experiencing difficulty with a basic bodily function, likely related to their recent surgery. The context of the sentence specifically mentions drinking, which suggests the bodily function in question is related to the mouth or throat. The options "coloring," "glass," "use glass," and "mouth" are not related to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated. The correct answer is "swallowing," which is a common difficulty experienced after certain types of surgeries.
care for children | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that most people have five years after becoming a parent, indicating a timeline and a progression of parenting. Of the given choices, "care for children" is the most logical because it is a constant responsibility of being a parent, regardless of the child's age. "Speak freely" does not make sense in the context of parenting, while "school child" and "toddler" are specific stages in a child's development and may not apply to all parents. "Understanding children" may also be a constant responsibility, but it is not as direct as "care for children."
media attention | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going public about a controversial issue is likely to result in some form of attention from the media. When speaking publicly about a controversial issue, there is a higher likelihood that others will take notice and respond in some way. "Wide acceptance" would not be expected for a controversial issue, while "getting high" is not relevant to the context. "Consequences" is too broad and doesn't specify what type of consequences. "Press coverage" is similar to "media attention," but the latter is a more general term that includes coverage from non-print media sources.
answer telephone call | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a need to prove oneself, which can often be done through verbal communication. Answering a telephone call is a common way to demonstrate competence and capability, particularly in a professional or personal setting. The other options do not provide any clear indication of how proving oneself could be achieved.
computer printer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that writing reports has shifted from physical paper to electronic form using a specific device. The answer, therefore, should relate to a device that allows for electronic document creation and printing. The options "office supply store," "classroom," and "artist's studio" are unlikely to be correct since they are not related to electronic document creation. "Typewriter" is an outdated technology, so the only logical answer would be "computer printer."
worthlessness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the father placed a great deal of emphasis on the son's value and made it clear that it had to be earned. This likely made the son feel as though his worth was conditional and not inherent, leading to a sense of worthlessness. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional state that would arise from the situation described in the sentence.
boredom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is not having any success with fishing, which can lead to feelings of frustration and boredom. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they have no connection to the activity of fishing.
commute | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is taking a bus after work, which is usually done to commute to and from work. The other options, such as combat, avoiding parking hassle, going home, or getting somewhere, are not directly related to the context of commuting.
bathroom | Knowledge: A curling iron is a styling tool for hair, and it is typically used in a bathroom where there is access to a mirror, electrical outlet, and a flat surface for placing the curling iron. The other options do not provide any relevant information regarding where to use a curling iron.
container | Knowledge: The sentence implies that vacuums have some mechanism for storing the dirt that they suction up. A container is a common component in many vacuum models and is often located either on the top or the bottom of the device. The other options, such as closet or fridge, do not relate to the storage of dirt by vacuums.
movies | Knowledge: The phrase "motion capture" refers to a technology used in movie-making to capture the movements and actions of real-life actors and transfer them into digital animation. This technology is primarily used in the production of movies, as it allows for highly realistic and detailed animation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
warm place | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the snake found a warm spot to sleep next to a human. "Warm place" is the only choice that fits this description. The other options ("tree," "wooded area," "sand," and "sleeping bag") do not necessarily imply warmth, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
taxiplane | Knowledge: The other answer choices all suggest common locations where taxis can be found. Airports, train stations, and downtown areas are all places where taxis are often available for hire. Streets are also a common place to hail a taxi. The term "taxiplane" is not a commonly used term for a mode of transportation, suggesting that it is not a real option for finding a taxi.
fight | Knowledge: The word "anger" suggests a negative and potentially aggressive emotion, which makes "fight" the most appropriate choice among the options. While wrestling could be a physical expression of anger, it is not necessarily something people do when they feel angry with one another. Pass sentence and illustrate point do not fit the context of the question, and hugging may be a way to diffuse anger but is not necessarily the most common or typical response.
listen to radio | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking for a way to listen to music while in their car. The option "listen to radio" is the only one that makes sense in this context, as it is a common way for people to listen to music while driving. The other options, such as "open letter" and "promise to do," have no connection to the context of the sentence.
you're into | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman asked to swallow semen and the man replied that it was fine if "you're into" it, indicating that the decision to do so is a personal preference or kink. The other options, such as prostitute or pornstar, imply potentially negative or stigmatized connotations that do not align with the context of a consensual conversation between two individuals.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the potatoes were ordered by a chef, which indicates that they were likely intended for use in a professional kitchen setting. The most logical answer, therefore, would be that they ended up in a restaurant. The other options, such as baked or fried, describe possible preparations for the potatoes, but do not answer the question of where they ended up. The option of countryside is also unlikely, as it would not make sense for the chef to order potatoes and then take them to a rural area.
Colorado | Knowledge: The sentence uses the phrase "mile high" which is a reference to the elevation of Denver, Colorado which is known as the "mile high city." The sentence also suggests that the marmoset is not commonly found outside of a zoo, which rules out options such as rainforest and mountains where the animal may be found in the wild. The other options such as France and Texas have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
South Dakota | Knowledge: Mammoths are extinct animals that once roamed parts of the world, including North America. South Dakota is known for its fossil beds and excavations that have uncovered mammoth remains, making it a likely place to find a mammoth. Egypt and ancient times may also be associated with the discovery of ancient creatures, but there is no specific connection to mammoths. An encyclopedia is a resource that can provide information on mammoths, but it is not a physical location to find one.
factory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a lot of noise, and that there may be loud impacts happening. This could be indicative of heavy machinery or equipment, which would be commonly found in a factory setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not typically involve loud, impactful noise.
fire | Knowledge: Coal is a combustible black or brown sedimentary rock that has been used for centuries as fuel to burn in order to create heat and light. It is commonly used as a fuel for lighting fires in homes, buildings, and other settings. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
marriage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the condition that has stopped is related to something happening in a marriage, which is the act of being abandoned by one's spouse. The other options do not make sense in the given context. "Gain", "acquire", "unite", and "engage" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
going to jail | Knowledge: The word "charged" indicates that the person is facing criminal charges for killing people, which typically results in a legal trial and potential imprisonment. The phrase "reside where" suggests that the question is asking about where the person is likely to end up after being charged with murder. The options "terrible," "murder," and "get arrested" are not logical answers to the question, and "home" is unlikely since a person accused of murder would likely be taken into custody.
public disapproval | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there may be social consequences to farting in public, which suggests that it is considered impolite or inappropriate behavior. This is supported by the choice "public disapproval" which directly fits the context of the sentence. The other options may also be associated with farting but do not specifically relate to the potential social consequences mentioned in the sentence.
shock | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that a person visiting a museum and realizing an object is missing would likely feel shocked. This is because losing an artifact from a museum collection is a rare and serious occurrence, and visitors would likely be surprised to learn that something valuable or historically significant is no longer available for viewing. The other options are unlikely to be associated with this situation, as they do not reflect the seriousness or emotional impact of a missing artifact.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location mentioned is a place where someone can retire at the end of the day and watch television. Out of the given options, the most likely place for this would be a bedroom, where someone can relax and wind down before going to sleep. The other options, such as a museum or bar, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A cabinet is too small to accommodate a television, and an apartment could have TVs in multiple locations, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
balloon | Knowledge: The question asks for a method of transportation that uses air to float, which immediately eliminates the options of surface of earth, supermarket, and train station. The use of the term "float" implies a lighter-than-air method of transportation, which is characteristic of balloons. Space shuttles, while they do use air for propulsion, are not typically associated with floating.
nice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's perception of Jane was different from her actual personality. The opposite of "mean" would be something positive, such as "nice" or "kind." The options "generous" and "friendly" could also be seen as positive traits, but they do not specifically answer the question of what Jane's true personality is, whereas "nice" directly contradicts Sam's initial perception. The options "cruel" and "mean cruel" are also opposites of Sam's initial perception, but they are redundant and do not provide any additional information.
homework | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to pass the class, the student needs to complete a type of assignment that is done away from school. The word "homework" fits this description because it is a common task assigned to students to be done at home. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: "sleep" is not an assignment, "graduate school" is a different level of education, "study hard" and "smart" are not specific tasks or assignments, but rather general characteristics.
Canada | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog lives in a place with thick snowy wilderness where people use sleds. Canada is a country known for its snowy landscapes and dog sledding culture, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
chicken coop | Knowledge: Eggs are laid by chickens in a chicken coop before they are collected by the farmer. The other options are not relevant to the process of collecting eggs from a farm. The supermarket and egg carton options refer to processed or packaged eggs while the inside of a chicken and omletts are not locations where eggs are found before being collected by a farmer.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: The question is asking about where the closest place to find a potato is, which implies that the potato is most likely already accessible and not in a distant location like a different country or state. The option "kitchen cupboard" is the most logical answer as it is a common location for storing potatoes in a household. The other options, such as Ireland or England, may have a historical or cultural association with potatoes, but do not necessarily indicate a location where a potato can be found easily. The option "chicken" is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the question.
fall asleep |  | Knowledge: It is a common stereotype that eating turkey can cause drowsiness or make a person feel sleepy. This is because turkey contains an amino acid called tryptophan, which is a building block for the neurotransmitter serotonin that has a calming effect. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is "fall asleep" as it matches the stereotype associated with eating turkey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
anger | Knowledge: Losing in any competitive game can evoke negative emotions such as frustration, disappointment, and anger. In the context of playing soccer, losing can be particularly upsetting as it often entails putting in significant physical and mental effort without achieving the desired outcome. Sweating and getting tired are physical sensations that may accompany playing soccer but do not specifically relate to the emotional response to losing. Work out and excitement are unlikely to be correct as they are positive feelings and not commonly associated with losing a game.
pray | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a priest is still able to do something despite not being able to talk. Praying is one of the main duties of a priest, and it is a form of communication with God that is not dependent on speech. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not align with the role and duties of a priest.
physical exertion | Knowledge: The sentence describes a person engaging in physical activity ("running after ball while playing baseball") on a hot summer day. As a result, the person's body would likely experience physical exertion, which refers to the effort and energy expended during physical activity. Tiredness, sweating, and breathing heavily are also possible outcomes of physical exertion, but they are not as directly linked to the context of the sentence. Injury is possible but not a universal consequence of exercise.
laughter | Knowledge: The sentence asks for how someone can express audibly that they are having fun, which suggests that the correct answer must be a sound that is associated with enjoyment. Of the options provided, only laughter fits this criteria. Smiling and pleasure are not necessarily audible expressions, while injuries and boxing have negative connotations and are not associated with having fun.
drunkenness | Knowledge: Inebriation refers to the state of being intoxicated or drunk, which is why the most appropriate answer would be drunkenness. Regret is a potential consequence of drinking too much, but it is not a direct result of becoming inebriated. High energy is not a common result of intoxication and is more associated with stimulants than alcohol. Paralysis implies a loss of bodily function and is not typically associated with alcohol consumption. Arrest is a potential consequence of engaging in illegal or dangerous behaviors while under the influence of alcohol, but it is not directly related to the state of becoming inebriated.
experiment | Knowledge: Learning about science often involves understanding theories and concepts that can be applied through experimentation. Experimentation is a key component of scientific inquiry and allows individuals to test and refine their understanding of the natural world. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of learning about science.
communication | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady enjoyed talking with friends and used something to stay in touch with them. The option that best fits this context is communication, as chatting with friends typically involves some form of communication (such as texting, calling, or messaging). The other options (answers, hands, happiness, agreement) do not relate to the idea of staying in touch with friends through communication.
desktop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual needs a calculator readily available while they are working on something that involves a lot of math. While a wristwatch or purse could be places where one might keep a calculator, the sentence refers to doing math at work, making an office or desktop a more likely option. The specific mention of an accounting department might lead some to choose that option, but it is too specific and narrow to fit the context of the sentence.
central park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that renting a horse and buggy is a unique way to see something, and that it is expensive. Central Park is a popular destination for horse and buggy rides, and is known for being an expensive tourist activity. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
construction site | Knowledge: The sentence implies that excavation is starting to create a foundation, which is typically done at a construction site. The other options (underground, groundbreak, city, cemetery) do not make sense in the context of building a foundation.
get down | Knowledge: The phrase "get down" is often used as a euphemism for dancing or partying, which makes sense in the context of going to a club. "Lay down" and "sitting down" do not have any connection to the context of going to a club, while "go down" and "sit down" may have sexual connotations that do not fit the overall tone of the sentence.
school | Knowledge: The word "class" suggests that we are referring to a learning environment, and the word "scheduled" implies that this is a regularly occurring event. The option "church" is unlikely since bells are more commonly associated with religious practices. The option "boat" also seems unlikely since it is not a common practice to use bells to signal the end of a class on a boat, and the other options are more likely. The option "educational institution" is too broad and could refer to a variety of settings other than a school, which leaves the option "front door" and "school". While bells may also be used at a front door or entrance, it would be more appropriate to use a bell to signal the end of a class within a school building since it is a traditional and commonly accepted practice in many schools.
travel | Knowledge: A vehicle is designed and used primarily for transportation purposes, which involves moving from one place to another. The other options do not accurately reflect the purpose of a vehicle. To receive damage, slow down, or run are not inherent characteristics of a vehicle, and while carrying is a function that vehicles can perform, it is not necessarily its main purpose.
receive letters | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to what a person in jail receives from loved ones. The option "receive letters" makes the most sense as it is a common way for family and friends to maintain communication with someone in jail. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
pizza | Knowledge: Melted cheese is commonly used as a topping on pizza, which is a well-known and popular dish made with dough, tomato sauce, and various toppings, including cheese. The other options, such as refrigerator or market, do not make sense in this context as they are not associated with melted cheese. Bread may sometimes have cheese melted on it, but it is not as commonly associated with melted cheese as pizza. Fridge is also not a specific location for finding melted cheese.
television show | Knowledge: The question is asking about a visual media format, which is typically viewed on a television or other digital device. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
cooking pot | Knowledge: The question is asking for a way to make a potato soft, which typically involves cooking it. The term "cooking pot" is a common kitchen tool used for boiling or simmering food, which would be an effective way to cook a potato and make it soft. The other choices - restaurants, beef stew, steak house, and let it rot - are not relevant or appropriate answers for the question.
slight | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the measurement had to be adjusted, which implies that it was not quite accurate to begin with. The phrase "just right" suggests that the adjustment needed to be relatively small in order to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, out of the choices given, 'slight' is the best answer to describe the type of increase needed. 'Mighty' implies a large increase, 'negligible' suggests that the adjustment would have had little effect, 'useless' and 'petty' are not appropriate modifiers for the word 'increase' in this context.
remember | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the children cannot follow the original rules of the card game, which implies that they do not remember or understand them fully. "Count" and "bid" do not relate to the idea of not being able to follow the original rules, while "winning" and "concentrate" do not provide a plausible reason for why the children would make their own rules.
airport | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that uniformed officials are searching travelers for terrorists, which is a security measure commonly associated with airports. Airports have security checkpoints where officials screen travelers' belongings and person to ensure that no prohibited items or dangerous individuals are able to board flights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
backpack | Knowledge: The question is asking for a good way to carry a small dog, which suggests that the answer needs to be practical and safe for the dog. Chinese food, grocery bag, and basket are not appropriate options for carrying a living animal. Good hands may work for a short distance, but may become uncomfortable over time. A backpack designed for carrying pets would be the most suitable option as it allows for hands-free movement while keeping the dog secure and comfortable.
look around | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that standing in a queue at a store means you have some time to spare, which could be spent observing your surroundings. Watching and looking around are similar in meaning and suggest that you have an opportunity to take in your surroundings. Whistling and daydreaming are unrelated and do not provide any information about the activity of standing in a queue. Impatience may be a common feeling when standing in a queue, but it is not a possible action that one can do to their surroundings.
chess piece  | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the object being described is a pawn in a chess game, which is a specific type of chess piece. The fact that it was hand carved suggests that it may be a high-quality or artisanal piece in a larger chess set. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, and do not make sense given the information provided.
get hurt | Knowledge: The word "precarious" suggests that the rescue situation is unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Therefore, it is likely that someone involved in a precarious rescue could get hurt. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as "corrupt" implies unethical behavior, "abandon" suggests leaving someone behind, "endanger" implies putting others at risk, and "bind" does not make sense in this sentence.
boat | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a vehicle that can be steered with a wheel while being wet, which suggests that it must be a type of watercraft such as a boat. Bicycles and cars are not typically used in wet environments, and a medium or a state like Michigan have no clear connection to the context of the question. The trunk of a car is not a vehicle itself, and it cannot be steered with a wheel.
tell truth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that honesty is related to a particular action. The phrase "tell truth" is an idiomatic way of saying "to be honest." It is a common saying that someone who is honest "tells the truth." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
blisters | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that James experienced a painful and long-lasting symptom on his hands while climbing, which is commonly associated with blisters. Blisters are a common occurrence when climbing or doing any activity that causes repetitive rubbing or pressure on the skin. The other options are not as closely related to the context of the sentence, such as loss of oxygen or vertigo, which are broader health issues rather than specific symptoms related to climbing.
dress themselves | Knowledge: The word "clothing" implies that the answer must relate to how adults put on or wear their clothes. "Smoke cigarettes," "drive vehicle," "park," and "drink beer" are not related to clothing. "Dress themselves" is the only option that makes sense in the context of the question.
trouser leg | Knowledge: Ferrets are known for their inclination to crawl into small spaces, and trouser legs can be a tempting option as they provide a dark and narrow environment similar to a burrow. In contrast, the other choices have no clear association with the behavior of a ferret.
release energy | Knowledge: Anger is often associated with an increase in physiological arousal, which can result in a release of energy. This energy can manifest in a variety of ways, such as through increased heart rate or muscle tension. The other options do not accurately describe the internal experience of anger, and may instead be actions or behaviors associated with anger.
increased knowledge | Knowledge: Learning about science involves gaining new knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and principles. Testing and experiments are methods used to explore and confirm scientific theories, but they are not exclusive to the learning process. A sense of wonder may arise from discovering the complexity of the natural world and the amazing things that science can explain. Intimidation may be a barrier to learning, but it is not a necessary or desirable outcome of studying science.
deck | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is sitting outside and has put up a railing to prevent falling. The railing blocking their view implies that they are sitting on some elevated surface. Stairwells and flights of stairs would require descending or ascending, and the lawn would not provide an elevated surface. The house is too vague and does not provide any specific surface to sit on, leaving the deck as the most likely option for an outdoor elevated surface that might require a railing.
garden | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the terrace being covered in green, which implies that it will be used for growing plants. This suggests that the dream piece is related to gardening, which is commonly associated with having a beautiful and functional garden. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the idea of a terrace being used as a garden space.
teach children | Knowledge: The sentence implies that teachers have multiple responsibilities, including acting as a babysitter, but they achieve the most success or fulfillment by doing something else that is not mentioned explicitly. One of the primary responsibilities of a teacher is to teach children, making this the most likely option. The other options do not align with the primary role of a teacher or the context of the sentence.
smell smoke | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a potential danger in the house that would cause children to run out. It is likely a fire, as the other options do not suggest any danger or urgency. Therefore, it is logical to choose "smell smoke" as the correct answer.
United States | Knowledge: Arkansas is one of the states in the United States of America, so the correct answer is "United States". The other options, such as Colorado, Mexico, and Oklahoma, are not countries but rather states or regions within the United States or other countries.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about the type of wine list to expect in Paris, which suggests that the answer is related to the type of establishment where wine is usually served. The correct spelling of the word "restaurant" is also provided as one of the options, which suggests that this is the correct answer. The other options, such as "French" and "Canadian," are not likely to be related to the type of wine list one would encounter in Paris. Additionally, the repeated option "resturant" is a misspelling of the correct answer.
microphone | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a booth set up for interviews, which suggests that the host was using a microphone to conduct the interviews. Microphones are commonly used in broadcast studios to amplify the voice of the host or guests to the audience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
studio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was working on a draft and wanted to take it to be completed, which implies that they are in a space where artwork is typically created. The most likely option is a studio, which is a dedicated space for artistic work. The other choices are all related to houses or buildings, but do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
take lessons | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a preferred method for improving one's wrestling skills. "Taking lessons" is a common way for individuals to learn new techniques and improve their overall performance in various sports. The other options may also help improve wrestling skills, but they are not specified as the best way to do so in the context of the sentence.
wrong | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person's parents had a religious belief system that did not align with divorce. The word "trying" suggests that the person was met with resistance from their parents when trying to explain why stopping their marriage was the right thing to do. The word "objected" in the choices directly relates to this idea of resistance, while the other options do not. The choice "wrong" makes the most sense as it opposes the person's parents' beliefs, and therefore, their objections to the situation.
drinking | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah was able to consume a large quantity of beer, despite the fact that she may have had too much. Therefore, the correct answer is drinking. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either relate to the negative consequences of drinking (alcoholics anonymous, drunkenness, hangover) or are too general (have fun).
fart or smell bad | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a reason why someone would not want to sit next to you, and two of the options (fart and smell bad) are related to personal hygiene or bodily functions that can make others uncomfortable. The other options (drink, relax, just do) do not relate to the context of the question and do not provide a logical reason why someone would avoid sitting next to you.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair gel should be stored in a location near where you get clean, which is commonly associated with the bathroom. Bathrooms are the primary location for personal hygiene activities, including showering or bathing, and are also commonly used for storing toiletries and personal grooming items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
travel | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is going somewhere that is an hour away, which suggests that they will be traveling to get there. The other options do not make sense in the context of traveling to a destination that is an hour away.
animated film | Knowledge: The word "moving" suggests that the weasel is in motion, which is something that would typically occur in animation rather than a static medium like a children's storybook or an imaginary scenario. Corn fields and chicken coops also do not seem to have any relevance to the presence of a weasel, so the correct answer is most likely an animated film.
enjoyment | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common behavior associated with listening to music. While people may dance or keep time to music, these are not universal behaviors and may depend on the type of music or social context. Shouting is also not a common behavior associated with listening to music, unless it is a specific type of music where shouting is encouraged, such as at a rock concert. Learning may occur while listening to music, but it is not the primary behavior that people engage in. Enjoyment, on the other hand, is a universal experience associated with music listening, as people often listen to music for pleasure and relaxation. Therefore, the correct answer is enjoyment.
pain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not experience joy when his idea became a reality, but rather a negative emotion. The word "pain" indicates that this emotion may be related to disappointment, frustration, or sadness. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they all suggest positive emotions.
car accident | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a potential negative consequence associated with taking a phone call. One possibility is that the distraction from the call could result in a car accident while driving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
music store | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about where to buy a child's first violin. A music store is a likely place to find beginner instruments, including violins. Orchestra and symphony orchestra are not places to buy instruments, but rather groups of musicians who play together. A violin case is a container for the instrument, but not a place to purchase it. A vegetable market is completely unrelated to the topic.
cabinet | Knowledge: The options backpack, donation bin, grocery store, and supermarket all suggest places to take the can of food or dispose of it, rather than places to store it in the home. Cabinet, on the other hand, suggests a place within the home where one might store food items. Therefore, cabinet is the correct answer.
boardroom | Knowledge: A committee typically refers to a group of people who are tasked with making decisions or discussing a particular topic. In a corporate or organizational setting, committees often meet in a boardroom, which is a dedicated meeting room for higher-level discussions and decision-making. The other options may be possibilities for where a committee could meet, but boardroom is the most likely choice based on common corporate and organizational practices.
trunks | Knowledge: The use of the term "fully loaded" suggests that the cars are equipped with a variety of amenities or features. The mention of "spacious" further implies that these features relate to the interior of the vehicle. Of the choices given, only trunks fit this description, as they refer to the amount of storage space available in the car. The other options (bumpers, windows, seat belts, and heavy) do not relate to the interior of the vehicle or the idea of being "fully loaded."
stink up room | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person was farting and not being detected by others. Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that relates to the odor being undetectable. "Stink up room" is the correct answer because it means to make a room smell bad, which would indicate that the person's farts had no discernible odor. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
time to rest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is tired after running all day, which is a physical activity that can cause exhaustion. Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that addresses the person's physical needs, which is to rest and recover from the exertion. Water can also help rehydrate the person, but it does not address their need for rest. Intellectual stimulation, looking beautiful, and compliments are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
two story building | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can be owned by a person and has the potential for a second floor, which narrows down the options to buildings. A cave is not a building, a school is generally owned by a school district or government, and a hotel is typically owned by a company or group of investors. A house could have a second floor, but the term "two story building" is more specific and could also refer to other types of buildings, such as a commercial or office building.
pay cut | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boss was stingy and did not want to give the employee a raise. The word "but" indicates that there was a negative outcome to the employee's request. A pay cut is a logical option given the context, as it would reduce the employee's salary without necessarily firing them or demoting them. The other options are either too extreme (such as firing or demotion) or do not make sense in the context of the sentence (push down).
pillow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that feathers may be a common material used in some objects, but not in others due to allergies. Pillows often use feathers as a filling material, but many people are allergic to them. The other options do not have any clear connection to feathers or allergies.
pantry | Knowledge: A container can of corn is a type of canned food that is typically stored in the pantry. The other options such as garage, in a packet, liquid or cupboard do not make sense in the context of storing canned food. The pantry is a common location in the house for storing non-perishable food items, including canned goods.
coloring book | Knowledge: A blue apple tree is not a real or natural occurrence, so it would not be found at a garden center or in Washington State or Florida. It is also not likely to be the subject of a math problem. However, it could be included as a fantasy element in a coloring book or other artistic or imaginative work.
music shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Manny's triangle is a musical instrument. A triangle is a percussion instrument that is commonly used in music, and it is sold in music shops. The other options do not have any relevance to the context of the sentence. Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with shapes and angles, and it is not related to the musical instrument. Science class also has no relevance to the context. A math book would not help Manny find a replacement for his triangle. While there may be triangles in a music room, it is not related to the fact that Manny needs to find a new one.
nest | Knowledge: Birds are known for building nests to lay their eggs in, and this is a common behavior across many different bird species. Birds typically build nests out of materials like twigs, leaves, and grass, which provide a safe and secure place for their eggs to hatch and develop. The other options, such as forest or cage, do not accurately reflect the behavior of birds laying eggs.
library | Knowledge: Index cards are commonly used in libraries to organize and catalog books and other materials. It is unlikely that an office supply store or park would have a display of index cards, and a card catalogue is a specific part of a library system rather than a museum itself. An oral report also does not seem to fit with the context of index cards being on display.
stay in bed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is feeling sick and has a project to finish. In this scenario, it is important for the person to prioritize their health and well-being, so they should choose an option that allows them to rest and recover. 'Thank god', 'feel ashamed', and 'live happily' are unrelated to the situation and don't provide helpful advice. 'Work at home' may be an option, but it still involves working while feeling sick, which could make the person feel worse. Therefore, 'stay in bed' is the best and most practical option for someone who is feeling sick and needs to finish a project.
music store | Knowledge: The question is asking where to find a bugle to take home, which suggests the person is looking to purchase one. A music store is a common place to buy musical instruments, including bugles. The other choices, such as a farmer's wife or a military base, do not typically offer bugles for sale to the general public. The option "military band" may suggest a place where bugles are used, but it is not necessarily a place to buy one.
lawn mower | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the blade being referred to is a cutting tool that is powerful enough to cut through living things. Scissors and blades of grass do not have this kind of power or ability to be used on larger objects like living things. Rollerblades and helicopters do not have blades designed for cutting, whereas lawn mowers are specifically designed to cut through grass and other living things.
air | Knowledge: Since a plate cannot physically fly, the question is likely referring to a situation where the plate has been thrown or launched through the air. In this context, the correct answer is air, as the plate would be surrounded by the air as it flew through the atmosphere. The other options, such as taxiway and runway, are related to airplanes and airports and do not fit the context of the question. Pets would not be inside a flying plate, and sky, while related to the flying aspect, is not something that is "inside" the plate.
freezer | Knowledge: Ice cream is best stored in a freezer because it needs to be kept at a constant low temperature to maintain its consistency and prevent it from melting. Storing ice cream in a party setting, under the counter, or in a movie theater would not provide the necessary cooling environment to keep it frozen. "Served cold" is not a specific location for ice cream storage.
greater mobility | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child is in the process of learning about the world, which often involves movement and exploration. The phrase "toddling child" also implies that the child is just starting to walk and gaining more physical capabilities. This aligns with the idea of greater mobility, which refers to the ability to move around more freely and explore one's surroundings. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
own home | Knowledge: The question is asking for a common location where you would find a freezer with food in it. The most likely answer is in someone's own home since most people have a freezer as part of their refrigerator or a separate freezer unit in their home. The other options such as an appliance store, garage (unless it's part of the home), bedroom, and "freeze food" are unlikely places for a freezer with food in it.
thunderstorm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that water is falling from the sky, which is a phenomenon commonly associated with thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are characterized by heavy rain, lightning, and thunder, and are known to bring precipitation to areas that have been experiencing drought or dry conditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Disneyland | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a popular west coast attraction that is located near a lot of water. This could refer to Disneyland, which is located in Anaheim, California, near both the ocean and several rivers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk drawer, schools, pencil box, office supply store | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer is a location where one might find an eraser. The options listed are all places where one might find an eraser. The only option that doesn't make sense is "principal" because it is not a location where supplies are typically kept.
ocean floor | Knowledge: Sand dollars are a type of sea urchin that can be found on the ocean floor. Therefore, it is likely that the shop got the sand dollars from the ocean floor. The other options (high school, container, atm, downtown area) do not make sense in this context and are not related to where sand dollars can be found.
hotels | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the reception area being referred to is related to a business where one spends 24 hours. A hotel is one such business where guests check in and out, and the reception area is typically where guests are welcomed and registered. The other options may have reception areas, but they do not fit the context of a 24-hour business where one spends the night.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hot dogs were expensive, which is a common characteristic of food sold at sporting events. Food prices are often inflated at events where there is high demand and limited options, such as sporting events. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
train station | Knowledge: The phrase "something on tracks" implies that the location mentioned in the question is related to trains. A train station is a common place where people wait for trains on tracks. The other options, such as state parks or crosswalks, do not typically have tracks or transportation-related activities. The bus stop and bus depot may have tracks for certain types of buses or light rail systems, but the question specifically mentions "something on tracks," which suggests a larger and heavier vehicle like a train.
running in herd | Knowledge: Horses are social animals and often live in herds in the wild. When horses are seen in a group, they are typically running together as a herd. While horses may graze together in a field or be described as gentle, these do not necessarily indicate group behavior. "Brown" and "put in stall" are not relevant to the question.
think of life | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person has lost all hope, which typically refers to a feeling of despair or negativity. When a person is feeling this way, they may tend to introspect and think about the bigger picture of their life. It is unlikely that they would turn to buying a car, paying bills, or forming friendships in this context, as these actions do not address the underlying feelings of hopelessness. Expecting miracles is also unlikely, as this suggests a level of optimism rather than despair.
fingers | Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific physical trait that separates humans from dogs. Fingers are a unique feature of humans and primates, which allow for fine motor skills and manipulation of objects. Dogs do not have fingers, but they do have paws with claws. The other options in the choices may also be true, but they do not directly answer the question asked.
enjoy learning | Knowledge: The question is asking for a behavior or action that is typically associated with a person who likes school. The other options, such as fever and catch cold, are unrelated to the topic and do not make sense in the context. "Play dumb" may be a behavior someone who dislikes school might exhibit, but not necessarily someone who likes it. "Read text" is a neutral activity that could be done by anyone regardless of their attitude towards school. "Enjoy learning" is the best answer as it directly relates to the topic and is a common characteristic of someone who likes school.
floor | Knowledge: The question specifies that the clock should be placed on the floor, so the correct answer must be an option that can be placed on the ground. The other options (shelf, on the hand, own bedroom, wall, department store) suggest places where a clock might be located, but they are not relevant to the specific placement indicated in the question.
refrigerator | Knowledge: Tomatoes are best stored in a cool environment, which can extend their shelf life by several days. The refrigerator is an ideal place to store tomatoes because it helps slow down the ripening process and keeps them from becoming overripe or mushy. "Squashed" and "pizza" are not relevant to storing tomatoes, and "market" and "put somewhere" are vague and do not provide specific information about how to keep tomatoes fresh.
toy store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child would want to be in a fun and playful environment while the person is shopping for greeting cards. A toy store is an obvious choice as it is a place where children can play with toys and games while their parents shop. The other options, such as a casino or table, do not fit the context of the sentence and would not be appropriate places for a child to be.
hotel room | Knowledge: A kitchenette is a small kitchen area typically equipped with a stove top, sink, and small fridge. While a lunch room or house may have a kitchen, it is unlikely to be a small kitchenette. An apartment may or may not have a kitchenette, depending on its size and amenities. However, a hotel room or cheap motel is more likely to have a small kitchenette as it is designed for short-term stays and may not offer a full kitchen like a house or apartment would.
work hard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order to receive recognition at work, one must put forth effort and work hard. This is a commonly accepted idea that suggest that hard work is often rewarded in the workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
flat | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John's bathroom is not in working condition, so he would have to find an alternative place to use the bathroom. Out of the choices given, a flat (apartment) is the most likely option, as John may not have access to a neighbor's house, rest area, or school on Saturdays. A litterbox is also an unlikely option for a human to use as a bathroom.
anything | Knowledge: The use of the word "stuff" in the labeling of the box suggests that it could contain a variety of items. The word "anything" supports this idea and is a more open-ended option compared to the other choices, which refer to specific types of storage containers or contents.
cupboard | Knowledge: A cupboard is a storage space typically found in a kitchen or dining area where pots, pans, dishes, and other kitchenware are kept. If someone is using a pot, it is likely that they took it out of a cupboard or cabinet before starting to cook. The other options do not make sense in this context - a toilet is not a place for cooking utensils, a porch is unlikely to have kitchenware, a greenhouse is for plants, and a restaurant would have its own pots and kitchenware.
perspiration | Knowledge: The sentence provides information that living in a humid climate can be uncomfortable, and one common discomfort associated with humidity is sweating or perspiration. When the air is warm and humid, our body's ability to cool itself through sweat is reduced, and this can lead to discomfort or a feeling of being sticky. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mediterranean sea | Knowledge: The Mediterranean Sea is located in southern Europe and is connected to the Atlantic Ocean. Greece is a country that borders the Mediterranean Sea, and therefore seeing a shark here would likely mean the person is in this region. The other options do not have any clear connection to Greece or the Mediterranean Sea.
hardware store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the desired item is paint, which is typically sold in stores that specialize in building materials and home improvement supplies, such as hardware stores. The other options do not have any clear association with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be locations where paint is commonly sold.
hospital | Knowledge: Hospitals require clean linen for patient beds, linens, and towels. Daycares may also require clean linens, but it is not as critical as it is in a hospital setting. Dresser drawers and cabinets have no relevance to the context of the given sentence. While hotels also require clean linens, the mention of "John's workplace" implies a more specific environment than a general hotel setting.
waste | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being taken is related to gaining profits. Of the given options, cutting down waste is the most likely to have a direct impact on increasing profits. This is because reducing waste can lower expenses and increase efficiency. Meetings, losing weight, and the options "loosing" and "lost" are not directly related to gaining profits in the context of the sentence.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence provides information that the person needed both cabbage and make-up, suggesting that they would need to go to a store that sells both groceries and beauty products. The options "freezer," "refrigerator," and "plate" do not make sense as places to buy make-up. While a "supermarket" may also sell both groceries and beauty products, a "grocery store" is a more specific term for a store that primarily sells food items.
further knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe has a strong desire for knowledge, as he is described as an academic who wants to learn as much as possible. The phrase "in pursuit of" further emphasizes his determination to acquire knowledge. Among the options, "further knowledge" is the most appropriate answer because it directly relates to Joe's motivation. The other options have different meanings, and they do not fit the context of the sentence.
gas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny enjoys eating but experiences negative consequences after doing so. The phrase "he often develops" implies that there is a regular pattern to his symptoms. Gas is a common digestive issue that can result from eating foods that don't agree with someone's digestive system. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bank vault | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the robbers were after a large sum of money, which is most likely stored in a secure location. Banks typically keep large amounts of cash in a vault or safe, making "bank vault" the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
major city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hospitals are commonly found in a specific type of location, as people generally do not have to worry about medical emergencies when traveling. Major cities are often associated with having a larger number of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers due to their higher population density and resources. In comparison, the other options do not have the same concentration of medical facilities and resources.
science | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person finds art in nature, which could refer to natural patterns, shapes, or colors. The mention of "finding" and "explain" also suggests a curiosity about the underlying mechanisms that create these natural art forms. Science is the most likely choice because it deals with the study of the natural world, including the underlying physical and biological processes that create the patterns in nature. Math and logic are less likely because they deal with abstract concepts rather than the physical world, while graffiti and education have little to do with the context of the sentence.
human experience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sex is something that is common to all people, which implies that it is a part of the human experience. The other options are more specific and do not encompass the universal nature of sex. Reproductive cycle and insemination suggest a more biological focus, while procreation is more specific to the act of having children. Gaining strength is not an accurate description of the function or experience of sex.
play with | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally brought a ball for a specific purpose, which is to do something with it while she is with Scott. The most common activity associated with playing with a ball is bouncing it or playing with it. The other options, such as "toy" and "charming," do not make sense in the context of playing with a ball. "Earball" is not a commonly used word and does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
frightened | Knowledge: Running away from a big animal suggests a sense of fear and danger, which is commonly associated with feeling frightened. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tube | Knowledge: The sentence states that the jelly was put into a tube, so the answer must relate to that specific object. The option "donuts" does not make sense in this context, as jelly is typically spread on top of donuts rather than put inside a tube. Similarly, "table" and "peanut butter" do not fit as they are not related to jelly specifically. "Jar" could be a plausible answer, but the sentence specifies that the jelly was put into a tube, not a jar. Finally, "refrigerator" is irrelevant to the question, as it does not address where the jelly was bound.
above board | Knowledge: The phrase "above board" is commonly used to describe someone or something that is legitimate, honest, or transparent. In the context of the sentence, if someone is sharp and highly qualified for a job, it suggests that they have the necessary skills and experience to perform well in the role. Thus, their qualifications are above board, meaning they are legitimate and transparent. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context, as they are either opposite to the intended meaning or have no clear connection to the sentence.
obey | Knowledge: The word "command" implies a direct order or instruction from someone in a position of authority, such as a teacher. In this context, the appropriate response would be to follow the command and complete the task or instruction given. The other options do not fit the context of a command, as questioning or asking for clarification may not be appropriate in certain situations, and serving or following may not accurately reflect the relationship between a teacher and a student in a classroom setting.
plate | Knowledge: Lasagna is a dish that is typically served hot and immediately after it has been cooked. Therefore, it is likely to be found on a plate or in a serving dish after it has been prepared. The other options do not logically fit as places to find cooked lasagna - a market or store would have uncooked ingredients, and a freezer would only contain frozen, uncooked lasagna or leftovers that would need to be heated up again.
bed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when darkness came, the person in question went to something for safety or comfort. The most likely option is bed, as it is a common place for people to go to sleep and find comfort. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
people laughing at | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that farting has a humorous aspect to it, which often results in people laughing. The other options all have negative connotations associated with farting, such as bad smell, social ostracism, and causing unpleasant odor. While loud noise is a common feature of farting, it is not necessarily a fun result in itself.
plane | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the lights were used for a safe landing, which suggests that they were installed on a surface where airplanes land. The option "plane" is the only one that fits this context. The other options do not make sense in relation to the function of the lights for a safe landing.
Los Angeles | Knowledge: The question references a "famous" basketball court, which suggests that it is well-known or has some significance in the basketball world. While basketball courts can be found in a variety of locations, such as gyms, parks, or schools, the fact that the question specifically references a "stadium" and a city (Los Angeles) suggests that the famous court is likely located in a professional sports arena in Los Angeles.
lights | Knowledge: Typically, when a play is about to start in an auditorium, the lights will gradually dim or fade out in order to signal to the audience that the performance is about to begin. This allows the audience to focus on the stage and the actors without any distractions. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sex | Knowledge: The sentence implies that forgiveness is difficult in a situation where one's spouse has engaged in a specific behavior. The use of the word "sex" suggests that this behavior is likely to be infidelity, as this is a common reason for difficulty in forgiving a partner. The other options either do not relate to infidelity or are too vague to provide any clear indication of what behavior might have occurred.
car show | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can cause excitement even when it is not moving, implying that people are excited about the potential for movement or motion. A car show fits this description, as attendees are often excited about the cars on display and imagining their potential for speed and movement. The other answer choices do not have the same association with movement or potential motion.
communicate | Knowledge: Canoeing is a common activity for couples and can be a peaceful and leisurely way to spend time together. While some couples may choose to get married in a canoe or engage in sexual activity, these options are less likely and not mentioned in the question stem. Fishing is a possible activity, but the question asks what a couple might do, not necessarily what they will do. Rowing about is also a possible option, but communication is a key aspect of canoeing to ensure safety, navigate the waters, and make decisions together. Thus, communication is the most reasonable answer.
in washington | Knowledge: The word "bald eagle" suggests a type of bird, which is commonly associated with the United States. The option "in washington" is the most likely answer, as Washington State is known for having a significant population of bald eagles. The other options, such as captivity and zoo, do not make sense as bald eagles are typically found in the wild. Canada is also a possibility, as bald eagles are found there, but the question specifically asks about a state in the United States.
form opinions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are being informed of an imminent war, which means that they will most likely need to make decisions or take actions based on this information. "Form opinions" is the most appropriate answer, as it involves processing the information and deciding what to do next. "Believe in god" and "worship idols" are not relevant to the context of an impending war. "Hope for peace" is a possible action, but it does not involve actively responding to the information given. "Buy tanks" is an extreme and unlikely response for most people.
talk | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mother gave some advice to her daughter before passing away. Since the daughter is experiencing some issues, it is likely that the mother's advice is related to coping or dealing with those issues. Smiling, being happy, and laughing do not seem like appropriate advice in this context, as they do not address the daughter's problems. Falling down is also an unlikely answer. Talking, on the other hand, is a common way to express one's feelings and get help with emotional issues. Therefore, the correct answer is talk.
say hi | Knowledge: Saying hi is a common greeting when meeting a friend, especially in casual or informal settings. Shaking hands is also a common greeting in some cultures or more formal settings, but it is not always necessary when meeting a friend. Smiling may accompany the greeting, but it is not a standalone action that would signify the start of a meeting. Having coffee or giving a hug are optional actions and not necessarily the first thing one would do when meeting a friend.
coldness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the relationship has gone from being passionate to one where one person is now showing no emotion towards the other person. The word "heat" implies passion, while "coldness" implies a lack of emotion or affection. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as air conditioning and cooling are unrelated to relationships, and indifference and coolness do not imply a lack of emotion.
legs | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that running is good cardio for the heart, but it also targets regular muscles. The context suggests that the question is asking which muscles in particular are targeted by running. Since running involves a lot of movement in the lower body, it makes sense that the answer would be either thighs or legs. However, agility and movement are not specific enough and use of muscles is too general to be the correct answer.
flower shop | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Laura likes blue anemones, which implies that John is looking to buy her a specific type of flower. The most logical place to find a blue anemone would be a flower shop, as they specialize in selling flowers of all types and colors. The other options, such as a flower pot or seafood restaurant, are not relevant to the context and do not offer any clues as to where John might find a blue anemone.
know how to act | Knowledge: The question is asking about the purpose of finding information about manners, implying that the goal is to gain knowledge on how to behave in social situations. The other options may be related to manners in some way, but they do not directly answer the question of what one hopes to achieve by seeking information about manners.
idleness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people may be chatting with friends instead of doing work, which implies that they are not being productive and are wasting time. "Idleness" is the most fitting choice, as it specifically refers to a lack of productivity or activity. The other options do not accurately convey the concept of not doing work when there is work to be done.
hotel | Knowledge: The word "night table" suggests that the item is located in a bedroom, and the phrase "hand cream" suggests that the item is likely to be found in a place where guests would stay overnight. This implies that the correct answer is a location where people typically stay while traveling, such as a hotel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
library | Knowledge: Since the student needed a dictionary, it is likely that they went to a place where dictionaries are commonly found. The library is a common location for dictionaries, along with other reference materials. The classroom, shelf, and table do not typically have dictionaries readily available. While an encyclopedia may have a dictionary included, it is not as likely to have one as readily available as a dictionary in a library.
discreet | Knowledge: The saying "loose lips sink ships" implies that revealing sensitive or confidential information can have serious consequences. Therefore, the surprise party planners had to be very secretive and not reveal any information about the surprise party. The word "discreet" means to be careful and circumspect in one's speech and actions, making it the best match for the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context or meaning of the saying.
hungry | Knowledge: Bringing home fish is typically associated with cooking and consuming it as a source of food. The option "hungry" is the most logical and likely answer to the question as it is common to bring home fish to satisfy one's hunger. The options "sushi" and "have cooked" also relate to food, but they do not specifically address why someone would bring fish home. The options "else to eat" and "toy" do not have any connection to the context of the question.
office | Knowledge: The options "friend's house," "neighbor's house," and "school room" are all specific and limited in terms of the number of chairs available. "Earth" is a nonsensical option as it is not a location where chairs would be found. "Office" is a more likely answer as offices often have numerous chairs for employees and guests, especially if it is a large office. Therefore, the option "office" is the most logical based on the information presented in the question.
brooklyn | Knowledge: Brownstone apartments are commonly associated with Brooklyn in New York City. They are a type of building made from a specific type of brownstone rock that is found in the area. The sentence specifically mentions being away from the center of town, which further supports the idea of Brooklyn as the correct answer since it is the most densely populated borough in New York City and has neighborhoods away from the city center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
voice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist resisted talking to someone for a while, but eventually gave in. The word "voice" is the most sensible option because the sentence implies that the protagonist began talking to a specific person or individual, rather than a vague concept like "listening" or "language". "Sound" is too general and does not imply a conversation, while "another person" is less specific than "voice".
not to forget | Knowledge: The act of writing things down is often done to help individuals remember important information or tasks. By physically recording the information, it becomes easier to recall at a later time. While some people may also write things down to express themselves, speaking loudly or moving fingers do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving a car along a scenic highway can have a calming effect. This is likely because scenic drives are associated with beautiful scenery, which has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental well-being. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the calming effect of a scenic drive.
listen to radio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving can be boring, and people often do something to alleviate their boredom. The option "listen to radio" is a common activity people do while driving to pass the time. The other options either do not make sense in the context of driving or are not a common practice while driving (e.g. "hole in one" would be a golf term).
faithful | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man in question had loose morals, which implies that he did not adhere to traditional moral standards or values. However, when it came to his wife, he was always something different than what his loose morals might suggest. The word "faithful" means loyal or devoted, which would be the opposite of being unfaithful. The other answer choices - compact, discreet, and close fitting - do not relate to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be correct.
market | Knowledge: The word "produce" usually refers to fruits and vegetables, which are commonly sold at markets. A market typically refers to a place where goods are sold, such as a farmer's market or a grocery store. The other options, such as "the sun" and "mall", do not match the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in relation to selling produce.
gain wealth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if people are working hard and saving their money, they are likely to achieve a positive outcome, which is associated with gaining wealth. Working hard and saving money are often considered to be important factors in achieving financial success, which may explain why gaining wealth is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
war | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that soldiers are being trained to use explosive devices, which is a common tactic in warfare. In war, soldiers may use bombs and landmines to destroy enemy structures or equipment. Construction sites and emergencies would not typically involve the use of explosives by soldiers, making those options unlikely.
engraving | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wanted their favorite horse memorialized permanently, which implies that they requested some form of artwork or representation. The term "commission" also implies that the artwork was specifically created for this person. Engraving is a common method of creating detailed, permanent representations of artwork or designs, making it a likely choice for the commission. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
park | Knowledge: The question suggests that the location being referred to is a place where many people can gather to play baseball, indicating a large open space such as a park. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as they do not describe a location where people can play baseball in large numbers. America and Canada are countries, while pitchers mitt and sporting goods store are specific objects.
get food | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that someone walking into the room while cooking is likely looking for food. Cooking generally involves the preparation of food, and it makes sense that someone would enter a kitchen because they hope to eat. The other options do not fit the context or make sense in relation to cooking.
ribs | Knowledge: Pork ribs are a common meat used in BBQ and are often a popular choice for many people. The other options do not have any clear connection to BBQ or pork dishes.
very thin | Knowledge: As people age, their hair typically thins out due to a decrease in the number of hair follicles on the scalp. This can result in the appearance of bald spots or a general thinning of the hair. The other options (long or short, curled, coloured, lightweight) do not necessarily apply to all people as they age, and are not directly related to the natural changes that occur in hair as people age.
speaker | Knowledge: Magnets are commonly used in speakers and headphones to create vibrations that produce sound waves. The other options do not involve the use of magnets in this way - a fridge uses magnets in its door seals, a microwave uses them in its electronic components, a car may use them in its electrical system, and "magnetricity" is not a commonly recognized term.
zoo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context involves feeding animals in a designated area. Petting zoos are a common location where visitors can feed animals such as goats, pigs, and sheep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve feeding animals or a designated area for animal interaction.
hand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the artist drew digitally using a stylus on a pad, which requires a steady hand for accurate drawing. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in the given context.
town or village | Knowledge: Artisan markets are typically found in areas where there is a concentration of craftspeople who create unique and handmade goods. These areas are often found in small towns or villages where there is a community of artisans who sell their wares. While it is possible to find artisan markets in rural areas, they are more commonly found in town or village settings. The option "buy fresh vegetables" is not related to the context of the question, and "by a lake" does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
love another | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are people who only have sex for the first time if they have a strong emotional connection with their partner. This emotional connection is commonly referred to as love. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
care for people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people believe that God has a particular gift for them. Based on the wording of the sentence, it can be inferred that this gift involves taking care of people. This is supported by the fact that one of the choices is "work miracles," which does not fit the context of the sentence. The other options also do not fit the context as they do not pertain to a gift that God has for people.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the turkey needs to be kept unspoiled, which implies the need for a cooling mechanism. The options "bought at store" and "barrel" are not useful in this context. "Oven" is not useful as it creates heat and can spoil the turkey. "Fridge" is a common abbreviation for "refrigerator," which is a useful tool in keeping perishable foods like turkey fresh.
toenails | Knowledge: Yellow fungus is a type of fungal infection that commonly affects the toenails. The warm and moist environment of locker rooms and shower stalls can make it easier for the fungus to spread, but these options are less specific to yellow fungus compared to toenails. The sun and caves have no association with yellow fungus infections.
go someplace | Knowledge: The word "travel" implies movement from one place to another, so the correct answer must contain a reference to a destination. "Go someplace" and "go somewhere" both suggest an intention to travel to a specific location. "Time" and "energy" may be necessary to travel, but they do not indicate a specific desire to go to a place. "Have money" may be a prerequisite for travel, but it does not describe the action of traveling itself.
physical fitness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is exercising to improve something about their body. The options "losing weight" and "lost weight" imply that the person has already lost weight, while the option "breathlessness" implies a negative aspect of their current physical state. "Muscles" could be a possible answer, but it is not as broad as "physical fitness," which encompasses multiple aspects of the body's health and well-being. Therefore, "physical fitness" is the best answer.
energy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a robot needs something in order to function properly. The word "energh" is misspelled but can be inferred to mean "energy", which is a necessary component for a robot to be able to operate. "Job", "concentration" and "compensation" are not necessary for a robot to function, and do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cup | Knowledge: The question asks for a place to keep many pencils, which suggests a container of some kind. The option "cup" specifically refers to a small container that can hold pens and pencils, which is a common way to store them on a desk or table. The other options either do not offer a specific container or suggest a larger storage location for office supplies.
apartment building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests the speaker lives on the top floor of a building, which is most likely an apartment building with multiple floors. The phrase "nobody above him" indicates that there are no other floors or units above the speaker's apartment, which is a common feature of apartment buildings. The other options, such as a tall building, garden or office building, don't necessarily suggest anything about living on the top floor or the absence of others above.
come back | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject threw a stick away repeatedly, but the dog was able to retrieve it each time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "come back," which means return to the subject's location after being thrown away. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
serious | Knowledge: Putting on a professional stage play requires a significant amount of time, resources, and attention to detail. There are many complex tasks involved in creating a successful production, such as casting actors, designing sets and costumes, rehearsing scenes and music, and coordinating technical elements like lighting and sound. Therefore, it is likely that the answer is serious rather than any of the other options, which do not accurately describe the level of effort required.
busy city | Knowledge: The phrase "foot traffic" suggests a bustling and crowded area, which is commonly associated with urban areas and busy cities. While some of the other options may have shopping areas, only the "busy city" option aligns with the specific language used in the sentence. "Buy gum" and "strip mall" do not provide enough context, and "Canada" and "town" are too broad and unspecific.
planet earth | Knowledge: Liquid water is a defining characteristic of planet Earth as it is the only known planet with conditions suitable for the existence of life. Septic tanks, drenching, and puddles are all related to water in some way, but they are not associated with planets. The moon is a celestial body that has no known liquid water.
concentrating | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the student had trouble reading and suggests that he had to put forth effort while doing something specific. Furrowing one's brow is often seen as a physical manifestation of concentration or deep thought. Therefore, "concentrating" is the most likely answer. The other options don't fit the context of the sentence, as they don't necessarily involve a specific action in reading.
dependence | Knowledge: The context suggests that the people in need may be relying on the assistance being given to them, which implies a level of dependence. Smiles, warm expressions, and happiness may be present, but the emphasis on "dependence" suggests that this is the most likely choice. "Good will" also doesn't quite fit the context as it refers to a more general sense of kindness and generosity, rather than a specific facial expression.
return to work | Knowledge: The phrase "go off strike" implies that the workers were previously on strike, which means they were not working. The most logical choice would be for them to return to work once they have decided to end their strike. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
answer | Knowledge: The context suggests that the reader is looking for a response from their friend. Therefore, the correct answer is "answer." The other options are unlikely to be what the reader is looking for. "Get news" may be a reason why the reader asked their friend to write to them in the first place, but it is not directly related to the context of the question. "Envelope" is also not a valid answer since it is simply a part of the packaging for the letter. "Happiness" has no connection to the context and "though" is unclear in this context.
shoreline | Knowledge: A bay is a body of water that is partially enclosed by land, typically with a narrow entrance. The shoreline is the area where the land and water meet, and it is what separates a bay from the water beyond it. The other options are either unrelated to the concept of a bay, or do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
troubles | Knowledge: The word "sad" suggests that the tune being played is not a happy one. Additionally, the word "fiddling" can be associated with traditional folk music, which often portrays the struggles and hardships of everyday life. Therefore, it is likely that the sad tune being played is about troubles of some kind. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they imply a positive or neutral emotion.
oregon | Knowledge: Apple trees are commonly grown in areas with cooler climates and moderate rainfall. Oregon has a climate suitable for apple tree cultivation and is known for its apple orchards. The other options are unlikely to have a significant number of apple trees or suitable growing conditions.
power down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the computer was not responding and that Sam was having trouble turning it off. "Power down" is a common term used to describe shutting off a device or computer forcefully. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, with "believe in Satan" being completely irrelevant.
taking notes | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the student is looking for a way to remember information from class later. While paying attention and listening carefully are important, taking notes is a common and effective method of retaining information. Studying the book and gaining experience may also help in retaining information, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence as ways the student is using to recall information later.
jewellers | Knowledge: The context suggests that John needs to get his watch repaired, and jewellers are known for offering such services. Jewelry stores and department stores may also offer watch repair services, but "jewellers" is the more specific term that suggests a focus on repairing jewelry and watches. Guard tower and mall are not relevant choices in this context.
distracted | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a reason why someone would be unable to win when playing games. One possible reason is that they are distracted, which means their attention is divided between the game and something else. Being distracted can make it difficult to focus on the game and make quick, accurate decisions. The other options, such as being entertained, having fun or challenged, are more likely to help someone win games, as they create a positive and engaging experience. Being bored is also unlikely to prevent someone from winning a game, as they may still be focused on playing and trying to win.
fulfilling | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a connection between seeing an idea become reality and the feeling that comes after it. The most appropriate word to describe this feeling is likely to be "fulfilling" since it suggests a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. The other options are not as closely related to the context of the sentence. "Virtual living" and "very nice" are too vague and do not offer any specific information. "Inspiration" might be a possible answer, but it does not capture the specific feeling that is being referred to in the sentence. Similarly, "make money" is not relevant to the sentiment being expressed in the sentence.
carpet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pets had fleas and that the furniture and something else had to be treated too. The options "cat" and "dog" are unlikely since they are already mentioned as the pets. The option "roof" is unrelated to the context of the sentence. The options "rug" and "carpet" are both possible, but the fact that the sentence mentions "furniture" instead of "flooring" suggests that the correct answer is "carpet."
at hotel | Knowledge: The use of the word "reservation" implies that John is at a hotel. The other options, such as office park, large office, and real estate office, would not typically involve making reservations at a reception desk. The word "lobby" could be a possible answer, but the use of the phrase "reception person" instead of "front desk clerk" suggests that John is at a hotel rather than a general office building.
many people | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam was surrounded by people, but still felt alone. The phrase "family reunion" suggests that he was among relatives and extended family members, highlighting that there were many people present. The other options do not accurately describe Sam's situation, as "with someone" implies he had one specific person with him, "together" suggests he was not alone, "party" implies a festive atmosphere, and "in crowd" suggests he was part of a social group.
surface | Knowledge: The question is asking what is visible from the perspective of being on the earth. The surface of the earth is the most obvious answer, as it is what we stand on and observe every day. The sun is also visible from earth, but it is not something that can be seen directly without the risk of damaging your eyes. There is only one moon that can be seen from earth, so that is a potentially correct answer, but it is not as clear and straightforward as saying the surface of the earth. Gravity and four seasons are not visible objects, so they can be eliminated as potential answers.
expected | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person found something unusual, which means that it was not what they were expecting or what they were used to. The word "odd" itself implies that the thing was out of the ordinary, hence it was not expected. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they don't necessarily imply that the thing was strange or unexpected.
rest | Knowledge: Rest is the period of time when you are not active and recuperating your energy. Running requires a lot of physical exertion, which drains your body of energy. Resting after a run is crucial to help your body recover and regain energy to be able to run again. The other options do not reflect this recovery period after running.
like music | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone who enjoys hearing someone play the violin has a general appreciation for music. The other options do not pertain specifically to enjoying music or the sound of the violin.
suburbs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Johnny initially wanted to build his house away from the city but eventually gave up and settled for building it inside the city limits. The word "suburbs" refers to areas outside the city center but still close enough to have access to city amenities, making it the most likely option compared to the other choices, such as the pond, newspaper or surface of earth. The phrase "residential area" also suggests a location within the city limits, but it is not specific enough to be the right answer.
own property | Knowledge: The question implies that people with a lot of money engage in a specific activity or behavior. Of the choices, owning property is most commonly associated with being wealthy. This is because owning property is an investment that can appreciate over time and generate more wealth. The other choices are not as strongly associated with having a lot of money, for example, shaking hands is a common social action, paying bills and working hard are done by most people regardless of their financial status, and talking to each other is a basic human communication function.
express information | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the concierge is offering to provide information in response to any question that the person may have. "Express information" is the choice that best fits the context of the sentence, as it means to convey or communicate information. The other choices, such as "give clue," "analyse," "think," and "decipher," do not fit the context as well, as they do not necessarily involve providing information in response to a question.
north carolina | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the Piedmont, which is a region that stretches from Virginia to Georgia, but is often associated with North Carolina. The reference to a shirt factory also suggests an industrial setting, which is consistent with the manufacturing industry in North Carolina's Piedmont region. The other options, such as airplane, medicine cabinet, and fabric, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
elevator | Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer involves a device or location where music can be heard while moving between floors. Elevators commonly have speakers installed to play music or announcements for passengers. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
sun themselves | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions people being on a beach, which suggests that they are likely engaging in activities related to relaxation or recreation. Sunbathing is a common activity on beaches, as people often want to enjoy the warmth and comfort of the sun. Eating plants, gaining wealth, or talking to each other are not activities typically associated with being on a beach. Swimming is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide enough information to make it a definitive answer.
present | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker is currently absent, which means they are not present. "Being here" and "stay here" imply that the speaker is currently present, which contradicts the context of the sentence. "Come back" and "come here" suggest that the speaker is going to return, but do not provide any information about their current status.
experience joy | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is very happy. Joy is a common emotion associated with happiness, so it is the most appropriate answer. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or are not commonly associated with happiness.
injuries | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is something that would prevent football players from enjoying themselves during the game. Injuries are a common source of frustration and pain for athletes, and could easily ruin the fun of playing. The other options are all positive emotions or unrelated ideas that do not fit the context of the sentence.
classical | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that rap is not commonly associated with a genre of music that is often performed by an orchestra. Classical music is a genre that is commonly performed by orchestras, while the other options may not be as frequently associated with orchestral performances. Therefore, the correct answer is classical.
pharmacy | Knowledge: The question is asking where someone would go to buy pills, and the most common option for this is a pharmacy. Pharmacies are where prescription and over-the-counter medications are sold, and it is common to refer to going to the pharmacy to pick up medication. The other options (jar, hospital, medicine bottle, medicine cabinet) are not places where pills are typically purchased.
understanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending time contemplating ideas will lead to a particular outcome. "Contemplating" typically implies thinking deeply or considering a topic at length, which suggests that the outcome will involve gaining knowledge or insight. "Relaxation" and "action" are not necessarily outcomes of contemplation. "Revelations" is a closer option, but not all contemplation leads to sudden or profound discoveries. "Broke" is clearly unrelated to contemplation.
istanbul | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Mary's grandfather was from a place that no longer exists and has been renamed. Istanbul is a city that was formerly known as Constantinople, making it a likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Montana | Knowledge: The phrase "big sky country" is a nickname commonly associated with Montana, which is known for its expanses of open space and large, sweeping vistas. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the phrase or its context.
supermarket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to sells items for nourishment and shampoo. Hair salons typically sell hair care products, but may not sell items for nourishment. Cabinets are typically associated with storage and not commerce. Supermarkets are a common location to purchase both food and personal care items such as shampoo. Big box stores may sell a range of products, but supermarkets are specifically known for food and personal care items. Hotels may offer shampoo as an amenity, but are unlikely to sell items for nourishment. Therefore, the correct answer is supermarket.
win auction | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the free stuff that is worth money can be obtained through winning an auction, which is a common way for individuals to bid on and receive items of value without having to pay for them. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for how someone could obtain free items that are worth money. Applying for a job typically involves earning money, not receiving free items. Standing in line and buying Christmas presents may lead to discounts or freebies, but they are not the same as winning an auction for something valuable. "Taking care of proposals" is too vague and does not provide any relevant information.
Disneyland | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the snack food and ice cream are likely a themed item or novelty item sold in a specific location. Disneyland is known for its various themed shops and food items, including popular treats shaped like Mickey Mouse. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
indiana  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the rubber stamp has a race car in it to recognize the racing heritage of a specific place. Among the given options, only Indiana is known for its racing heritage, particularly the Indianapolis 500. Therefore, the correct answer is Indiana, and the other options are not related to racing or the context of the sentence.
distant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the station was not known for having a wide broadcasting range, as it was only considered "local." However, Sarah is able to pick up signals from a location that is not close by, indicating that she has some sort of external antenna or device to amplify the station's signal. The word "distant" accurately describes a location that is far away but still within range of Sarah's device. The other options do not make sense in the context of this sentence.
strong bones | Knowledge: Milk contains high levels of calcium, which is essential for building and maintaining strong bones. This is a well-known fact and is supported by various health organizations and medical experts. The other options are not related to the health benefits of drinking milk.
Africa | Knowledge: Trophy hunting is a controversial practice where hunters seek to kill large, impressive animals for sport and leave with a souvenir such as the animal's head or antlers. Africa is known to have a significant amount of trophy hunters, as the continent is home to many iconic animals such as lions, elephants, and rhinos. The other options do not refer to specific countries or regions known for their high number of trophy hunters.
satisfaction | Knowledge: The word "favorite" in the question suggests that the restaurant is a source of enjoyment or pleasure for the person. Eating at a favorite restaurant is typically associated with positive emotions and experiences, such as feeling satisfied or content. The other options do not match the context of the question and are unlikely to be the intended answer.
knocking over | Knowledge: Cats are well-known for their tendency to knock over objects, including cups, with their paws or by bumping into them. This behavior is often attributed to their natural curiosity and playfulness, and can sometimes be frustrating for their owners. The other choices are less likely to be associated with cats' behavior around cups.
Australia | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are multiple cities named Victoria but one of them is known for "doing it big". This could refer to a city that is known for its size, population, cultural or economic significance, or achievements in a particular field. The fact that Australia is listed twice as a choice might be a clue that it is the correct answer. Additionally, Australia is a large country with several major cities, one of which could be named Victoria and fit the criteria of "doing it big". The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city dweller  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person never moved to the countryside and remained in a city setting. The options "farm land," "pod person," "industrial," and "business man" do not fit the context provided, making "city dweller" the only logical choice.
bed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has removed their socks and is now lying down, which is a common action taken before going to sleep. The most likely place to do this would be in a bed, as it is designed for sleeping and lying down. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desk | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man had to leave work suddenly, so it's likely that he didn't have time to properly put away his paperwork. Desk is the most common location for papers to be left on in an office setting, so it's the most probable answer. The other choices (chair, meeting, office, work) do not provide a specific place where paperwork could have been left.
misunderstanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people are getting upset while chatting with their friends, which indicates that something has gone wrong in the conversation. Misunderstanding is a common cause of conflict in social interactions, as people may not fully understand what others are saying or may misinterpret their intentions. Discomfort, love, learning about, and sleeping do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide a clear explanation for why people might get upset during a conversation with friends.
bright sunshine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John needed shade because he was being blinded, which indicates that the source of the problem is the brightness of the light. The options "full sunlight" and "sunny place" are similar to "bright sunshine," but do not directly describe the cause of John's problem. "Moonlight" is the opposite of what is described in the sentence, and "tanning" is irrelevant to the context.
stringed instrument | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person admired the neck and bridge, which are parts of a stringed instrument such as a guitar or a violin. Additionally, the context suggests that the person is about to play the instrument, which further supports the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
coughing | Knowledge: Smoking is widely known to irritate the lungs and cause coughing, so if someone had been smoking, a cough could be a telltale sign. The other options are not necessarily indicative of smoking: inhaling can be done without smoking, being unhealthy could have many causes not related to smoking, being a chimney is a metaphorical phrase not related to smoking, and going outside could be done for reasons other than smoking.
go to bed | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that being tired leads to a certain behavior, and the options provide possible actions to take in response to feeling tired. "Go to bed" is the most logical and common option, as sleeping is a typical remedy for feeling tired. "Have rest" is also a plausible option, but it is less specific than "go to bed". "Go to the gym" would be an unlikely choice, as exercising is not usually associated with feeling tired. "Snore" is an involuntary action that occurs during sleep, not a conscious decision. "Watch TV" may be a way to relax, but it does not necessarily address the reason for feeling tired.
North America | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill lives in a place with a diverse animal population spread across unique climates that cover a wide area. The other options do not offer any indication of a diverse animal population, unique climates, or a wide area. North America is known for its diverse ecosystems and animal populations, making it a more likely answer.
homely | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane's outward appearance is not as attractive as her inner qualities, which often leads to the use of the term "homely." The word "homely" is often used to describe someone who is not conventionally attractive but is still warm, kind, and likable. The other options, like "sleepy," "misshapen," and "bad," do not fit the context of the sentence and are not commonly used to describe people's appearances. "Overcast" is a term used to describe weather conditions and does not make sense in this context.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: The question is asking where a woman would store a leg razor, and the choices provided are related to potential locations. Out of the choices, the most reasonable option would be a medicine cabinet, as it is a common place for people to keep personal hygiene items. The other options, such as outside or in a barber shop, are not typical places for an individual to store their personal items, and the option of "psycho's pocket" is not a serious or appropriate answer. A suitcase may be a possible location for someone who is traveling, but it is not specified in the question.
farmer's market | Knowledge: Farmer's markets are known for selling fresh, locally grown produce. Peas, being a vegetable, are likely to be freshest when they are grown and harvested locally. Supermarkets and grocery stores may sell peas that have been transported over long distances, which can affect their freshness. Freezers and microwaves are not places where fresh produce is typically found.
anger | Knowledge: The scenario presented implies that the person has spent all day doing housework, which could be physically and mentally tiring. The fact that someone else has come in and messed up their hard work may trigger a feeling of anger, as the action is seen as disrespectful and inconsiderate. The other options do not fit the given situation as well.
grocery store | Knowledge: Lettuce is a common grocery item that is usually found in the fresh produce section of a grocery store. A grocery store typically sells a variety of food items, including fresh produce, canned goods, and packaged foods. The other options (building, church, department store) do not necessarily sell groceries or have a clear connection to the context of the question.
see exhibits | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the children were on a guided tour, and the guide took them somewhere. The most common destination for a guided tour is to see exhibits, which suggests that this is the correct answer. The other options (to school, tickle, view video, jump rope) are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this context.
care less | Knowledge: The phrase "don't concern people themselves" suggests that the result is something that does not affect or interest them directly, which leads them to "care less" about it. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Talk to each other" and "play golf" are unlikely to be relevant to the result being discussed, while "trip over" is a physical action that does not make sense in this context. "Pay attention" is a possibility, but the sentence seems to imply the opposite - that people are not paying attention because they are not personally affected.
mud or snow | Knowledge: Animal tracks are usually most visible in areas with soft ground or surfaces where they can leave imprints. Mud and snow are good examples of such surfaces. Stadiums, train stations, and subways are unlikely to have animal tracks visible as they typically have hard, smooth surfaces that do not allow for animals to leave footprints.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was looking for a place to eat, and the options presented all relate to food. "Dinning room" and "dining room" both refer to a specific space in a house rather than a place to eat out, while "food store" suggests a grocery store rather than a restaurant. "Big city" is too vague and doesn't provide any information about a specific place to eat. "Restaurant" is the correct answer, as it is a common term used for a place where people go to eat out.
North America | Knowledge: The mention of a flag with a snake and motto could refer to the Gadsden Flag, which was used during the American Revolution and has since become a symbol of patriotism and liberty in the United States. North America is the only choice that is geographically relevant and could be associated with the use of this particular flag. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had the key in their possession and needed to retrieve it to unlock the door. The most logical place for someone to keep a key on their person is in their pocket, making "pocket" the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
kitchen | Knowledge: Sugar is commonly used in cooking and baking, so it is likely to be stored in the kitchen. The other options also suggest places where something might be stored or found, but they are not specifically associated with sugar in the same way that a kitchen is.
tuxedo | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob exhibited gentlemanly behavior by taking Sarah to a show and dressing stylishly. A tuxedo is a formal attire often worn to events such as shows, weddings, and other formal occasions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have sex | Knowledge: Biology teaches us that in order for a woman to conceive and give birth to a child, she must engage in sexual intercourse with a man. While there are alternative methods for becoming pregnant such as artificial insemination or surrogacy, the question's phrasing suggests a traditional heterosexual relationship. The other options do not have any relevance to the process of reproduction.
recorded | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the producer did not want to do the show in real-time, indicating that he wanted to pre-record the show. Pre-recording shows allows for greater control over the content and editing process, which can be beneficial for producers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
may trip or may fall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the person runs without watching where they place their feet, there is a possibility that they may trip or fall. "Fall down" and "may fall" are similar in meaning and may be correct, but "may trip" is a more specific possibility that also fits the context of the sentence. "Sweat" and "exhaustion" are not likely outcomes of not watching where one places their feet while running.
waste paper | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is about recycling, and specifically, recycling packing materials. The answer can be found in the phrase "don't recycle," which implies that materials are being thrown away instead. The option "waste paper" is the most relevant because packing materials are often made of paper, cardboard, or other similar materials. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fall down | Knowledge: The sentence describes the child running too fast and hitting their foot on a rock, which suggests that they may have stumbled or lost their balance. The phrase "hit his foot on a rock" is also indicative of a fall or trip. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, and are therefore incorrect.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the chair is intended to be used as a place to throw clothes on before going to bed, which suggests that it would be located in the bedroom. None of the other options (airport, floor, office) make sense in this context as a place to keep a chair for this purpose.
use weapons | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about a situation where people in the army are being attacked. In such situations, people usually use weapons to defend themselves and fight back. The other options, such as desire to travel, talking to each other, crying, or smoking marijuana, do not make sense in this context and are not relevant to the question.
death and destruction | Knowledge: In general, wars result in large-scale destruction of resources and infrastructure, as well as loss of life. This can be seen in historical examples of major wars, where entire cities and regions were devastated by the conflict. While defeat and killing people may also be outcomes of war, these are more specific and secondary effects, whereas death and destruction are the overarching consequences of conflict. Evil is not an accurate or objective description of the result of war.
poor workmanship | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the chair fell apart due to a problem with its manufacture or construction. "Poor workmanship" describes a level of craftsmanship that is below standard or subpar. The other options do not provide any clear explanation for why the chair may have fell apart. "Bad taste" and "crummy" are subjective judgments and have nothing to do with the quality of the chair itself. "Cheap" and "medium" describe cost or quality level, but do not specifically relate to the chair's construction or durability.
suitcase | Knowledge: Clothing is typically packed in a suitcase when going on vacation, making it the most likely answer choice. Trunks are not commonly used for travel anymore and washing machines and closets are typically found in one's home, not on vacation. While stores may sell clothing for vacations, the question is asking about where clothing is found while on vacation, not where it is bought.
appear blue | Knowledge: On a sunny day, the sky usually appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere. This effect is known as Rayleigh scattering and causes shorter wavelength blue light to scatter in all directions more than longer wavelength red light, making the sky appear blue to the human eye. The other options do not accurately describe the appearance of the sky on a sunny day.
being heard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy has a positive association with singing because it allows him to do something specific. The phrase "being heard" indicates that singing may provide a sense of validation or attention for Billy. This idea is further supported by the other answer choices, which all suggest negative consequences of singing (such as a hoarse voice or sore throat).
intertidal zone | Knowledge: Sea anemones are commonly found in the intertidal zone, which is the area of the shoreline that is exposed during low tide and submerged during high tide. This area provides a habitat for many marine animals, including sea anemones, that can withstand the changing water levels and exposure to air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
headaches | Knowledge: The sentence implies that drinking too much leads to a type of discomfort the following morning, which is often associated with headaches. Headaches are a common symptom of a hangover caused by excessive drinking. Intimacy, riots, and nausea are not typically associated with hangovers or excessive drinking.
rest | Knowledge: The phrase "run out of steam" is a common expression that means to lose energy or motivation. The sentence suggests that the competition contestant was tired and needed a break to recharge. The word "rest" is the most logical choice as it directly relates to the idea of taking a break to regain energy. The other options are less likely because "dying" is too extreme, "quitting" implies a complete abandonment of the competition, "you'll sleep" is not a verb, and "pause" does not imply rest or recuperation.
damnation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's beliefs are against killing, and that if they were to do so, they believe they would face some type of negative consequence. The word "damnation" implies a religious or spiritual consequence for committing a sin, which fits with the idea of violating one's beliefs. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
deep sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a contrast between the dream state of being wide awake and the reality of being in the middle of something that contradicts that. The phrase "deep sleep" is commonly used to describe a state of being unconscious or unaware of one's surroundings, which fits with the contrast presented in the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
large city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many stores with books in a certain location, and this is most likely to be found in a large city. Large cities tend to have more retail stores, including bookstores, due to their high population density and demand for a variety of products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
country | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the government has control over something specific, and the word "country" is the only option that would fit that description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the word "control" is too general to be a specific answer to the question. The word "army" could be a possible answer, but it is more likely that the government controls the country as a whole rather than just military forces.
gain weight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man liked to eat hamburgers but did not exercise, which can lead to a caloric surplus and weight gain. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence - gas could be a possible result of eating hamburgers, but it is not specific to the man's situation. Health problems and death could potentially result from an unhealthy lifestyle, but there are no clear indicators in the sentence to support those options. "Enjoy" is not a result of eating hamburgers and not relevant to the context of the sentence.
graveyard | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about a place where a human could go to be close to their deceased ancestors. The option "graveyard" is the most obvious choice as it is a place where the remains of deceased individuals are buried, and where people often go to pay their respects to their ancestors. The options "civilisation," "underground," "spacecraft," and "space shuttle" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
bribe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was a politician who lacked integrity and would take things that he shouldn't have, indicating that he may have engaged in corrupt activities such as accepting bribes. Bribes are typically given as a way to influence political decisions or gain an unfair advantage, making them a logical choice for what James may have taken. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
street corner | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people are searching for a mode of transportation or a ride somewhere, and street corners are typically where taxis or other forms of public transportation can be found. Apartments, gardens, and the space shuttle are unlikely options for finding a taxi, and "public place" is too vague to be a specific answer.
kindness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person beyond showed empathy and compassion towards the lady who was struggling to find change in her purse. The option "kindness" best fits this context as it refers to the act of being friendly, generous, and considerate. The other options may not be relevant to the situation, for instance, "satisfaction" and "happiness" are emotions that are unlikely to be experienced by the lady or the person helping her.
go out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to meet new people, which may require him to leave his house and socialize with others. The option "go out" reflects this idea and is the only choice that implies leaving the home to meet new people. The other options do not address the issue of socializing with others.
manhattan apartment | Knowledge: The question is asking about a living situation that would only accommodate a small dog. Based on common living spaces in urban areas, a Manhattan apartment is a likely choice. Apartments in urban areas are often small and have limited space for pets, so a smaller dog would be more practical. The other options are not realistic choices for living with a dog. A dog show is not a living space, a tree is not a suitable home for anyone or anything, a farm would be better suited for larger animals, and living in a neighbor's yard is not a viable option.
airplane | Knowledge: Metal wings are a feature commonly associated with airplanes as they enable them to fly. Detroit and airport are not typically associated with metal wings, while heaven and birds do not have metal wings in the literal sense.
vacuum tube or television or oscilloscope | Knowledge: Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) were commonly used as display devices in early television sets and computer monitors, as well as in oscilloscopes for visualizing electronic signals. As CRTs operate by controlling the flow of electrons through a vacuum, they are also a type of vacuum tube. Therefore, any of the choices vacuum tube, television, or oscilloscope could be correct since they all utilize CRTs. The choice of screen or computer would be incorrect as modern displays and computers generally use different technologies such as LCD or LED displays.
stammering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Ben had difficulty reading the words on the teleprompter, which likely caused him to stumble over his words and speak less smoothly than usual. The word "eloquent" implies that Ben is usually a skilled speaker, which makes "stammering" the most likely choice since it describes someone who speaks with difficulty or hesitation. The other options either do not accurately describe the situation or are simply nonsensical.
reproduce | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having two dogs can quickly lead to having more, which is likely due to their ability to reproduce. Dogs are known to be sexually active and can mate with other dogs to produce offspring. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Barking and needing food are normal behaviors for dogs, while the idea of dogs owning people or making playmates is not supported by the evidence provided.
town or apartment | Knowledge: The question is asking about the type of dwelling that people live in, which can either refer to a town or an apartment. The other options, such as a supermarket or opera, are not associated with living spaces, and the word "crip" is likely a misspelling or a non-existent word. Therefore, the correct answers are likely to be either town or apartment.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John stored the pictures in a box for long-term storage, indicating that he placed them somewhere where they would not be easily accessible or moved frequently. The options "closet" and "garage" are typically used for short-term or everyday storage, so they are unlikely choices. The option "post office" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and "water" is nonsensical. Therefore, "basement" is the most likely option for long-term storage.
get frustrated | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is struggling with the computer program and is likely experiencing negative emotions as a result. The phrase "beginning to" suggests that the person's frustration is a new development in the situation. Staring at the computer screen and thinking logically are not necessarily indicators of frustration, and compiling and writing code are specific actions that do not necessarily reflect the person's emotional state. Therefore, "get frustrated" is the most appropriate answer.
listen to radio | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving a car can become boring or repetitive, implying that the driver may want to do something to alleviate this feeling. The option "listen to radio" stands out as a popular way to entertain oneself while driving as it does not require much physical movement or attention. The other options, such as changing gears or concentrating, would not necessarily help to break up the monotony of driving.
falling in love | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two people did not immediately feel an attraction to each other upon first sight, but that it was their first kiss that sparked a deeper connection. This is commonly associated with falling in love, an intense emotional state often brought on by physical attraction and connection. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - while embracing may be a physical connection, it does not necessarily suggest a romantic connection, and the other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
meeting new people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that social benefits are one of the advantages of choosing a cruise for travel. Being in close proximity with strangers would make it easier for passengers to meet new people and potentially make friends. The other options such as motion sickness, disorientation, and bad food are all negative aspects of traveling on a cruise, and getting somewhere more quickly is not mentioned in the sentence as a benefit of choosing a cruise.
broadcast | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John was not physically present for Sam's live performance, but he still managed to listen to it somehow. The most logical choice among the options provided is "broadcast," which refers to the transmission of audio or video signals over the airwaves or the internet. It is common for live events to be broadcasted in some way, either through radio or television, or through online streaming services. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
retirement community | Knowledge: The phrase "old folks" suggests that the chess board was being installed in a community or residence for elderly individuals. "Retirement community" is the logical choice, as it specifically refers to a housing development or complex designed for senior citizens. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
religion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that mission workers are constantly communicating something to many people. The other options (accomplish, notoriety, hellfire, learn about) do not fit the context of mission workers, which typically refers to individuals who travel to share and promote a specific religious faith or belief system. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be religion.
music room | Knowledge: A clavichord is a small keyboard instrument that was commonly used in private homes during the Baroque period. As such, it would be more likely to be found in a music room, which is a space specifically designed for making music in a residential setting, rather than in a public venue like a music hall or museum. A clavichord would also be too delicate and quiet to be heard in a movie show, and a parlor might not be large enough to accommodate the instrument.
car crash | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the given choices are related to the consequence of a car crashing. "Relaxation" and "flowers" do not make sense in this context. "Wreak" is a misspelled form of "wreck", which is commonly used to describe the damage caused by a car crash. "Smoke" may be a result of the crash, but it is not a certain consequence. Therefore, "car crash" is the most appropriate answer.
maritime museum | Knowledge: The question suggests that the shark being referred to is no longer alive and is on display somewhere. The option "great barrier reef" does not make sense as sharks that are no longer alive would not be found there. "Deep ocean" and "ocean" are also unlikely as it would be difficult to display a dead shark underwater. "Pool hall" does not fit the context of the question. "Maritime museum" is the most appropriate option as it is a common place where preserved marine life specimens are displayed.
having fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children were laughing while they were playing, which indicates that they were enjoying themselves. Laughing is typically associated with happiness and enjoyment, which makes "having fun" the most likely answer. "Learning" and "winning" may be things that happen while playing, but they do not necessarily indicate that the children were having fun in the moment. "Getting tired" and "injuries" are also possible outcomes of playing, but they do not relate to the children's emotional state while they were playing.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was trying to clean up water that was splashing onto the floor from an overflowing toilet. Typically, toilets are located in bathrooms, so it is likely that the toilet in question in this sentence is also located in a bathroom. The other options do not make sense in this context - an apartment, a house, a bedroom, and a motel room can all contain bathrooms, but they do not specify that the toilet is located in a bathroom.
sore feet | Knowledge: The other choices listed do not necessarily prevent someone from starting to dance. Becoming tired or sweaty may make someone less likely to continue dancing, but it would not necessarily prevent them from starting. Wearing beads or having fun are unlikely to be obstacles to dancing. Sore feet, on the other hand, would make it uncomfortable or painful to dance, which could prevent someone from beginning to dance in the first place.
photograph | Knowledge: The question suggests that the goal is to preserve a memory of the small dog for future recollection. A photograph is a commonly used tool to capture and preserve memories of loved ones, including pets. Movies and baskets do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence, while laboratory and school are not likely to be associated with remembering a small dog.
tropical waters | Knowledge: Sharks are cold-blooded animals, meaning that their body temperature is regulated by the temperature of the surrounding water. Therefore, if a shark is feeling cold, it would likely look for warmer waters to swim in. The options "ocean," "sea world," "tomales bay," and "great oceans" do not specify a particular temperature or climate that would necessarily warm up the shark. "Tropical waters," on the other hand, explicitly suggests warmer waters, making it the most appropriate choice.
wonderful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after working out and releasing energy all day, one is likely to experience a positive feeling. The word "wonderful" indicates a sense of excitement, pleasure, or happiness, which are commonly associated with the after-effects of exercise. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence. "Being fired" and "damage" are completely unrelated, "feeling cold" is not a common outcome of working out, and "exhaustion" is often associated with negative feelings, which contradicts the tone of the sentence.
artillery | Knowledge: Artillery refers to weapons such as cannons or guns used in warfare, so it would make sense to stock these kinds of weaponry. The other options listed, such as a fishing rod or tin can, do not have a clear connection to stocking weapons. Additionally, the phrase "double in worth" does not make sense in the context of the question.
Florida | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person is looking for a condominium near the Gulf of Mexico, which is located in the southern United States. Michigan and Washington are located in the northern part of the country and do not have access to the Gulf. California is located on the West Coast and does not have access to the Gulf of Mexico. "Community" is not a location and cannot be a correct answer. Therefore, Florida, which is located on the southern U.S. coast and has access to the Gulf of Mexico, is the correct answer.
rocks | Knowledge: Lizards are often associated with hot, dry environments, and are known to thrive in rocky areas since they provide ideal shelter, warmth, and protection. Alaska, on the other hand, is too cold for lizards, while gardens do not typically provide the rocky terrain lizards need. Although New Mexico and deserts may be suitable options, rocks are the most specific and likely habitat for lizards.
ipod | Knowledge: The question suggests that the jogger is using headphones for a particular reason. It is commonly understood that people use headphones to listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks while they jog. iPods are one of the most popular music players used for this purpose, which is why it is a likely choice of answer. The other options do not provide a logical reason for the jogger to wear headphones while jogging.
pretend | Knowledge: The question is asking about the basic action that an actor performs while performing on stage or in front of a camera. The correct answer is "pretend," because acting involves creating a believable portrayal of a character, situation, or emotion that is not actually happening in the actor's real life. The other options (branch out, eat curry, wear costume, sing songs) may be activities that are associated with acting in some way, but they do not accurately describe the main purpose or action of an actor.
greenhouse | Knowledge: A greenhouse is a specific type of structure that is designed for growing plants. It is common to have pots with live plants in a greenhouse, as the controlled environment allows for optimal growing conditions. The other answer choices are unlikely to have a pot with something alive in it. A kitchen drawer and closet are not suitable environments for a living plant, while a cupboard may have pots but not necessarily with something alive in them. A restaurant may have pots with plants for decoration, but they would not be kept in a pot in the main dining area.
strip mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the electronics store was located in a place where there are other nearby establishments, such as food kiosks. A strip mall is a type of shopping center that contains a row of stores or businesses along a single strip or corridor, often with a shared parking lot in front. This makes it likely that people would be walking from the food kiosks to the electronics store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
feeling refreshed | Knowledge: The phrase "stuck indoors all day" suggests that the person has been deprived of fresh air for an extended period of time. Therefore, when they finally get a breath of fresh air, they are likely to feel refreshed and rejuvenated. This option best fits the context of the sentence. While the other options may also be true, they are not the most specific answer to the question.
a pile of dirt | Knowledge: Excavation is the process of digging up and removing materials from the ground, such as soil or rocks. Once the excavation is finished, there will typically be a pile of dirt or debris left behind from the excavation process. This is often referred to as the "spoil" or "muck" pile. The other options do not accurately describe what is typically left after an excavation is finished.
deadly | Knowledge: The sentence compares the number of accidents caused by driving while sleep deprived to those caused by being drunk. This implies that both situations may lead to serious and potentially deadly accidents. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity of the outcome implied in the comparison.
aquarium | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a goldfish, which is typically kept in an aquarium. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
birth | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the parent is giving birth to their offspring, who will then be available for adoption. "Biological child" also fits the context, but the sentence suggests a birthing process. "Give away," "abandon," and "orphan" do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a separation between the parent and child that has already occurred or may occur after adoption.
skepticism | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned had some reservations or difficulty accepting something. The phrasing "while he wanted to believe" implies a certain openness or receptiveness, but something was holding him back. The choices "deny," "doubt," "disbelief," and "paranoid" all suggest a more active or reactive stance against the thing in question, whereas "skepticism" connotes a more cautious and measured approach. Therefore, "skepticism" is the best choice for the mindset that prevented him from accepting it.
increased heart rate | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John's doctor suggested that he needed to take better care of himself, which indicates that some physical activity would be beneficial for his health. The sentence also suggests that skating is not John's favorite activity, but he still prefers it over other options. The doctor's recommendation and the fact that skating involves physical movement suggest that the activity might have a positive impact on John's overall health. The option "increased heart rate" is the most likely effect of skating that could benefit his health, while the other options (move fast, might fall, injuries, hurt him) are all negative outcomes that could occur during the activity.
ignore | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question was not responded to, which means the person chose to not acknowledge or respond to it. The option "ignore" directly fits this context. The other options do not make sense in this context, as "ask" and "question" imply the person is the one posing the query, not the one responding to it. "Answer" doesn't fit either, as it suggests the person provided a response, which is contradicted by the sentence. "Mute" also doesn't fit, as the sentence doesn't mention any technological or electronic devices.
restrained | Knowledge: The word "restrained" implies being held back or prevented from moving forward. The other options ("constraint," "back," "backwards," and "past") do not convey this meaning. "Constraint" refers to a limitation or obstacle, but it does not specifically suggest being unable to move forward. The other options simply refer to different directions or movements.
stadium | Knowledge: Concert halls are typically designed specifically for music performances, with acoustics and seating arrangements optimized for the best possible listening experience. While theaters and commercial buildings may also have stages for musical performances, stadiums are generally designed for sports events or large-scale entertainment productions that require larger, open spaces. Therefore, it is unlikely to find a concert hall in a stadium. The other options all have some potential for housing a concert hall, depending on their specific features and design.
classroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was trying to avoid listening to someone speaking for an hour, which implies that he was likely in a setting where lectures or presentations are common. Of the options given, a classroom is the most likely setting for this scenario. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
office supply store | Knowledge: Sam needing clipboards suggests that he is likely in a workspace or educational setting where he needs to take notes or record information. An office supply store is a common place to find clipboards, whereas the other choices listed have no clear relevance to Sam's need for clipboards.
bed sores | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the old man is at risk for developing bed sores if he remains in bed for long periods of time without being moved. Bed sores are a common problem for patients who are bedridden or have limited mobility. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
sand box | Knowledge: Cats are known for using litter boxes or sand boxes to relieve themselves, as they prefer to bury their waste. The other options, such as ground or warm bed, are not appropriate places for a cat to relieve itself. Michigan is also not related to the context of the sentence.
connecting pieces of wood | Knowledge: The question implies that the wooden rod has a purpose other than being used in a clock. The option "connecting pieces of wood" suggests that the rod may be used as a tool for joining or reinforcing pieces of wood. The other options are not related to the context of the question and do not provide any information to help choose the correct answer.
impatience | Knowledge: The phrase "standing in queue for a long time" suggests that the person is waiting in a line or a queue. Waiting in line for an extended period of time can be tedious and may cause impatience. Whistling, looking around, and daydreaming are possible ways to pass the time, but the sentence indicates that the person is more than likely to experience impatience. Parking is not related to waiting in line.
petri dish | Knowledge: A petri dish is a common tool in microbiology used to culture bacteria. At the bottom of the dish, there is usually a gel or agar media that provides nutrients and a solid surface for the bacteria to grow on. Bacteria colonies can often appear as slimy or mucoid, which is why the petri dish is a suitable answer choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to bacterial growth or sliminess.
kitchen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people keep their telephone directory near the "nourishment" they keep in their house, which typically refers to food. It then asks where most people keep their telephone directory, implying that there is a common location where people tend to keep it. Given the context of the sentence, the most likely option is the kitchen, as this is where most people tend to store their food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the parking lot was only full during the day, suggesting it is located in an area with daytime activity, such as a city. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
farmer's field | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to obtain a potato as close to the source as possible. This means that they would want to get a potato straight from where it was grown before it is transported to other places. Therefore, the best option would be to go straight to the farmer's field where the potato was grown. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mail box | Knowledge: Unwanted advertisements are commonly known as "junk mail" and are often delivered to a person's mailbox without their consent. This is a common form of direct mail marketing and is often referred to as "direct mail." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
guilty conscience | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone did not get caught for killing someone. In this context, it is unlikely that they would have a conviction or go to jail, as those are consequences of being caught and found guilty of a crime. Similarly, retribution and criminal trial imply that there was some sort of legal or justice system involvement, which did not occur in this situation. Therefore, the most likely option is guilty conscience, which refers to feelings of guilt or remorse for having committed an immoral or unethical act.
washington state or woods | Knowledge: Apples are commonly grown in Washington state, which is known for its apple orchards. Alternatively, apple trees can be found in wooded areas throughout the United States, as many varieties of apple trees grow well in temperate climates. The desert and Spain are not typically associated with apple trees. The Bible, while it mentions apple trees, does not provide any specific information on where one might find them.
spare room | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the person is putting a sofabed in a house for a guest, suggesting that they are likely to place it in a room specifically designated for guests. The option 'spare room' is the only choice that matches this description, while the other options refer to a bedroom (on their bed), or various names for a shared living space (livingroom, living room, sitting room), which would not typically be used as a designated guest room.
slow down | Knowledge: Speed bumps are designed to slow down traffic and reduce the speed of vehicles. They are usually placed in areas where pedestrians are present, like parking lots or school zones. The other options are not associated with the purpose or effects of speed bumps.
become deaf | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was not willing to listen to his mother's advice about his music volume, which may imply that he was exposed to loud sounds for an extended period. Listening to loud music for long durations can lead to hearing loss, which is a gradual process that occurs over time. Therefore, the most logical answer is that John would gradually become deaf due to his exposure to loud music. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the sentence's context.
beauty | Knowledge: Grooming oneself in front of the mirror on the way out the door suggests a desire for personal beautification or self-improvement. While cleanliness and neatness may also be motivations for mirror-grooming, they are less likely given the context of "on the way out the door." Mistakes and anxiety do not seem related to the act of grooming oneself in front of a mirror.
serve customers | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was working in a restaurant or similar establishment. Waiting tables typically involves interacting with customers and taking their orders, which is why the correct answer is "serve customers." While serving food is also part of the job, it is not the action being described in the sentence. Tipping may be relevant to the job, but it is not an action that the person is described as having to listen to. Writing and washing hands are not related to the context of the sentence at all.
desktop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man wanted to view the picture while checking emails, which implies that he saved or pasted the picture somewhere easily accessible while working on his computer. Desktop is a common location for saving pictures on a computer, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
ride horses | Knowledge: Cowboys are typically known for their work on ranches, where they manage livestock such as cattle and horses. Riding horses is an essential part of their job, as they use them to move and corral the animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
outside | Knowledge: An amphitheater refers to an open-air venue for performances or entertainment. This type of venue is typically located outdoors, often in a natural setting such as a park or on the grounds of a historic site. The other options do not fit the context of an amphitheater. "Inside" suggests a closed or confined space, while "Greece" refers to a specific location rather than the type of environment an amphitheater provides. "Experiencing performance art" is too general and could apply to various types of venues, not specific to an amphitheater. "Park" could be a plausible option, but it is not as specific as "outside."
single person | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that only one person in the crowd is not in a relationship, implying that everyone else is coupled up. Therefore, the correct answer would suggest the opposite of being in a relationship, which is being a "single person." The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not accurately reflect the situation described.
lowering prices | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the bill was intended to combat inflation on products. It suggests that the bill aimed to encourage companies to lower their prices, but failed to achieve this goal. While raising interest rates and higher interest rates are generally associated with combating inflation, they are not relevant to the context of this particular sentence. Saving money and selling more products may be related to corporate goals, but they do not align with the purpose of the bill as described in the sentence.
factory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the noise is coming from a place where cars are being made. The most likely place for this would be a factory, where assembly lines and heavy equipment can create a lot of noise. The other options (mall, classroom, carnival, big city) are not associated with car manufacturing and would not require earplugs for this reason.
talk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people with mental issues need someone to do something specific for them. The options "listen to music," "play games," and "eat ice cream" don't address the issue at hand, and don't seem like appropriate solutions to help with someone's mental health. The option "have fun with" is too vague and doesn't provide any clear indication of how this might help with mental issues. The option "talk" is the most logical choice because it suggests that individuals with mental issues need someone to talk to in order to express their feelings and receive support.
farmer's field | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that it is time for a harvest and that potatoes can be found in abundance. This suggests that the location being described is a place where potatoes are grown in large quantities. The options "food market," "garden," and "Ireland" do not provide any context suggesting the location is a place where potatoes are grown. "Soil" may be a plausible answer but is not specific enough to describe where the potatoes can be found. Therefore, "farmer's field" is the most suitable answer.
calluses | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is new at playing the violin and therefore would be experiencing some discomfort or pain in the fingers from holding and pressing the strings down on the instrument. Calluses would develop over time with regular practice and would provide a bit of protection and comfort for the fingers. The other options do not seem to logically connect with the context of the sentence.
broken heart | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the relationship between the speaker and their girlfriend is romantic in nature. If the girlfriend is lying about seeing another guy, this would likely cause emotional pain for the speaker and could result in a broken heart. The other options, such as mistrust, getting dumped, being fired, and getting caught, may also be possible outcomes of the situation, but they are not directly related to the emotional impact on the speaker.
funeral | Knowledge: The question is asking about the gathering of loved ones after someone's final birthday, which likely refers to their death. The word "burial" also suggests a connection to death, and "die" is an action that occurs at the end of someone's life, but "funeral" specifically refers to the gathering of loved ones to honor and remember the deceased. "New age" and "happy" do not fit the context of the question.
landmine | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weapon in question continues to harm civilians long after the war is over, indicating that it is likely a hidden explosive device that is not easily detected or removed. Landmines fit this description as they are often scattered across large areas and can remain active for years, posing a threat to civilians and inhibiting post-war recovery efforts. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: A saucepan is a common kitchen tool used for cooking and is typically stored in a kitchen cupboard when not in use. The other choices do not make sense in the context of where to store a saucepan. Georgia is a location, Italian restaurant is a type of establishment, pan house is not a commonly used term, and boiling water is not a place to store a saucepan.
gas or electric | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about types of stoves, and the only two options that are relevant to stoves are "gas or electric". "Warm pot of beans" and "brown meat" refer to cooking methods rather than types of stoves, and "warm room" is not related to stoves at all.
street corner | Knowledge: The use of the word curb and bench suggest that the context is in an urban environment. The options ohio, tree, and bus stop are not related to sitting on a bench on a curb in an urban environment. City is also too broad and generic to be a definitive answer, while street corner specifically refers to the intersection of two streets where a bench could be located.
meet friend | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about what romantic partners do on their birthdays. Staying away from each other and pleasing parents are unlikely options for a couple celebrating a birthday together. Buying presents for others and making friends are also unlikely since the focus of the question is on the couple. Meeting a friend is a possible option as couples may choose to spend their birthdays with close friends.
comfortable shoes | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is going for a long walk, which implies that they will need shoes that are comfortable for walking long distances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Using roads would be a given for someone going for a walk, and having a slim waist or the best things in life are not practical or necessary for going on a walk. A headache is also not something that someone would need for going on a walk. Therefore, the correct answer is comfortable shoes.
muscles | Knowledge: The question suggests that the cause of the human hitting their hand on something is related to their own body. Muscles are responsible for movement and controlling the body, so it is logical that they would be the cause of accidentally hitting something. The other options, such as inner voices or stupidity, do not have any clear connection to the physical act of hitting one's hand.
bark | Knowledge: Barking is a common form of communication among dogs. They use barking to alert other dogs of their presence, to convey excitement, fear or aggression, and to establish dominance. Reproduction and cloning have nothing to do with communication between dogs, while "doing many things" and "jumping up" are too vague to be considered specific forms of communication between dogs.
bedsores | Knowledge: Staying in bed for extended periods of time can lead to bedsores, which are caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. The other options do not accurately describe the negative effects of staying in bed for too long. "Sleep in" refers to intentionally sleeping in and does not necessarily indicate prolonged bed rest. "Well rested" is a positive outcome of getting adequate sleep, not a negative consequence of staying in bed too long. "Aren't ready when arrives" and "lay down" are not related to the negative effects of prolonged bed rest.
band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group of musicians is playing together, which is commonly referred to as being in a "band." The other options either do not accurately describe a group of musicians playing together or are specific to different types of performances such as shows, operas, or plays.
waterfall | Knowledge: Waterfalls are typically characterized by a cascade of water falling from a height into a pool at the bottom. The other options do not fit this description, as a hose is not a natural water feature, a neighbor's house and backyard do not have pools at the bottom, and "at hotel" is too vague and does not provide enough information.
intoxication | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's behavior was influenced by alcohol, which is commonly associated with the term "intoxication." Intoxication refers to the state of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs and can result in impaired judgment, coordination, and behavior. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the effects of alcohol on behavior.
look silly | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that jumping rope is typically associated with younger individuals, and therefore an old man jumping rope may look out of place and somewhat comical to others. The other options may also be possible outcomes of jumping rope, but the specific question asked about how the individual would look while doing it.
history | Knowledge: The word "periods" in this context refers to different time periods or eras in history. Historians often categorize history based on the major events and cultural changes that occurred in different time periods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
stitches | Knowledge: Falling in gravel while running can result in cuts and abrasions, which may require stitches to close, especially if the injuries are deep. It is unlikely to cause a heart attack or weight loss. While falling down is a possible result of falling in gravel, it is not specific enough to be considered the correct answer. Exhaustion is also not directly related to falling in gravel.
cliff | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the bald eagle escaped from somewhere, and then made its nest in a location where it wouldn't be easily reached. The nesting location is described as a place that requires the bird to fly or climb to, which suggests a high altitude. Therefore, a cliff would be the most plausible option as it is a natural environment for eagles to build nests at high elevations. The other options do not fit the requirements for the eagle's nesting location described in the sentence.
typing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is actively engaged in a physical act of typing, which involves pressing keys on a keyboard or inputting text on a device. The other options either do not describe an action (letter, communication) or are too vague to be a specific answer (indeterminate). Sentences may be the result of typing, but they do not necessarily define the action being taken in the sentence.
motorbike | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item being described has a chain that is used to drive the back wheel, which is a common feature of motorbikes. Gear shifts and saloons do not typically have chains to drive their wheels, and while tow trucks may use chains to pull vehicles, they do not have a mechanism for driving their own wheels. Jewelry stores have nothing to do with the context of the sentence.
perspiration | Knowledge: When a living being is nervous, it activates the sympathetic nervous system, which can cause an increase in sweating. This is because the body is preparing to fight or flee, and releases sweat to help regulate its temperature. Getting old and death are not immediate consequences of nervousness, whereas laughter and palpitations are not physiological symptoms commonly associated with nervousness.
attic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the clothes the person is looking for are old and possibly unused, and that they are stored in a space above ground level. An attic is a common location for storing old or unused items, including clothes. The other options, such as a basement or store, do not have the same connotations of old, unused items.
bring joy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the new grandmother made a claim about how the baby affected her, and the phrase "bring joy" is a common expression used to describe the happiness or delight that a new baby can bring to family members. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of a new baby being born.
frustration | Knowledge: The phrase "having a hard time writing a term paper" suggests that the person is experiencing difficulty or struggling to complete the task. The choice "frustration" is the most appropriate answer as it relates to feeling upset or discouraged due to not being able to achieve a desired outcome. The other choices, such as "errors" and "illiteracy," suggest specific reasons for the difficulty in writing the term paper, while the choice "headaches" seems irrelevant to the context of the question.
roadblock | Knowledge: A sign and a long line of cars behind it is a common occurrence at a roadblock. Roadblocks are set up by authorities for various reasons, such as checking for drunk driving or for searching for a suspect. The other options do not have any clear connection to a sign and a long line of cars.
pick up | Knowledge: The phrase "make up hours" implies that the person needs to compensate for time lost at work by working extra later. "Pick up" in this context means to work additional hours to make up for those lost, whereas the other options do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence. "Hurry" suggests rushing through work, "win" is unrelated, "come across" means to chance upon something, and "find" is too vague to be the correct answer.
radio shack | Knowledge: Radio Shack is a chain of stores that specializes in selling electronics and technology-related products, including cables. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. A substation is a facility that manages the distribution of electrical power, not a retail store. Electrical devices and side ports of a TV may need cables, but they are not where you would purchase them.
shovelling | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the driveway is filled with snow, which means that some sort of action must be taken in order to clear it. Shovelling is a common method used to remove snow from driveways, so it is the most appropriate answer. The other options are not relevant to the situation described in the sentence. "Christmas" is a holiday, "avalanches" and "blizzard" describe weather conditions, and an "ice storm" may or may not result in snow accumulation on a driveway.
fear of death | Knowledge: The sentence implies that experiencing a heart attack can lead to panic, which can be caused by the fear of death. People who are having a heart attack may feel intense chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms that can make them worry that they are in danger of dying. The other options do not specifically address the potential consequences of a heart attack.
rainforest | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the marmoset can be found in many places, but there is one place where they are usually found, which implies that there is a common or typical habitat for the species. Marmosets are primarily found in rainforests, particularly in South America, where they thrive in the tree canopy. The other options, such as zoos or national parks, may be places where marmosets can be observed, but they are not necessarily their typical habitat in the wild. The option "in the wild" is too broad, as it does not specify a particular habitat or region. The option "American West" is also incorrect because marmosets are not native to North America.
bus | Knowledge: The keywords in the sentence are "window seat" and "ride," which indicate that the question is referring to a mode of transportation that has seats with windows. Out of the given options, only car and bus fulfill this criteria. However, a space shuttle is not a common over-the-road transport and a computer screen cannot be ridden. Taxy is also misspelled and is not a common mode of transportation. Therefore, the correct answer is bus, which is a popular form of long-distance travel that offers riders a chance to enjoy the scenery through their window seat.
spread | Knowledge: Cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases that can cause the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. As a result, cancer has the potential to spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body, making it difficult to treat and potentially leading to serious health problems. While cancer can be a serious and sometimes deadly condition, it is not accurate to say that it always results in death or that it "hurries" or causes death. Additionally, describing cancer as "bad" is too general and does not provide any specific information about the disease.
abdominal muscles | Knowledge: The sentence mentions deep breathing techniques, which are often associated with using the diaphragm and abdominal muscles to control the flow of air into the lungs. The other options either repeat information already given or do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
stockings | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a specific type of legwear that is made of nylon, which is commonly known as stockings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get comfortable | Knowledge: The sentence describes the person relaxing on their chaise lounge after a long day, suggesting that the next action they will take involves making themselves comfortable. The phrase "laid back" also reinforces the idea of relaxation and comfort. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence or are unlikely actions to take after a long day of work.
city | Knowledge: Churches are typically found in urban areas, such as cities, where there is a higher concentration of people and a greater need for a centralized place of worship. While churches can also be found in rural areas, the sentence does not provide any indication that this is the case. The other options are clearly not relevant to the context of the sentence.
bottle | Knowledge: Beer is commonly packaged and sold in bottles or cans, which can be found in liquor stores, grocery stores, and even some refrigerators. A casino, however, is not typically associated with the sale of beer in its original packaging, making it an unlikely answer choice.
plate | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the evening meal is being served, which suggests a sit-down restaurant rather than a fast food restaurant. Additionally, the phrase "served on" indicates that the food is placed on a surface, which would be a plate in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
hotel | Knowledge: The use of the word "visitors" suggests that the passageway is located in a place that is commonly visited by people who are not regular inhabitants of the area. Hotels are known for providing accommodations to travellers and tourists, making them a likely location for a passageway mainly used by visitors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the subject is taking business calls, which typically implies a work-related activity. The most logical place for this to take place would be in an office setting, where there is likely to be a phone available for use. The other options, such as a neighbor's house or a rest area, are less likely to be associated with work-related activities. While it is possible to take calls on a desktop or in a car, these options do not necessarily imply a work-related context.
movie theater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity of eating popcorn should be done quietly, which is a social norm commonly accepted in movie theaters. At a soccer game, there is usually a lot of noise and excitement, making it unlikely for someone to eat popcorn quietly. A carnival and a circus are also associated with loud spectacles and attractions. Although a movie house may also be a possible option, it is less commonly used than "movie theater" in modern English.
catch | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the receiver failed to catch a pass on the sideline, and his coach is urging him to "just make one" of something. Given the sport and context, it is most likely that the coach is asking the receiver to make a catch, which is the act of successfully catching a thrown ball. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence or the sport being referenced.
subway station | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the musician is not getting much attention, which suggests that they are playing in a relatively low-profile location. The option "subway station" is the only choice that fits this description since it is a public space where musicians often play for tips, but they may not have a large audience. The other options either suggest a well-established musical performance space (such as a symphony or orchestra) or a more controlled environment (such as a studio or stage) where performers are likely to have a specific audience.
ask | Knowledge: The question is framed in terms of giving a command, which implies a certain authority or power dynamic. In order to successfully carry out a command, the person being commanded needs to understand what is expected of them. That means they may need more information or clarification about what they are supposed to do. Therefore, the correct answer is "ask," since this is the best way to ensure that the person being commanded has a clear understanding of what is required of them. The other options are related to obedience or compliance in general, but they do not specifically address the issue of needing more information to successfully carry out a command.
hanging up | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Ryan answered a call, but the person on the other end did something unexpected. The phrase "hanging up" suggests that the person abruptly ended the call, which is the correct answer. The other choices could also apply, but they do not match the specific action described in the sentence. Talking, whispering, and communicating are all actions that someone can do while on a call, but there is no indication that the person did any of these things. Similarly, "response" is too vague and does not suggest a specific action the person took.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that knitting with a group of friends is a positive and enjoyable activity. The option "relaxation" is also a possible choice, as knitting is often considered a relaxing and meditative activity, but "have fun" is a more specific and direct choice. The options "carpal tunnel syndrome" and "bleeding" are negative and potentially harmful outcomes, which are not suggested by the sentence. "Talk" is a possible choice, but it is more of a secondary or supportive activity, rather than the primary purpose of knitting with friends.
cross river | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the only viable option for people needing something on the other side of a body of water is to cross the water. The other choices do not make sense in this context. Flapping arms and flying is impossible for humans, completing high school and talking to each other do not address the issue of crossing the water, and dying suddenly is not a solution to the problem.
down payment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple had the necessary financial resources to purchase a house, and specifically mentions "funds," which indicates that the answer may have something to do with money. "Careful" and "save money" may be relevant to the couple's financial situation, but are not directly related to purchasing a house. "Falling down" and "privacy" have no logical connection to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "down payment," which is a sum of money paid upfront in order to secure a mortgage loan and purchase a property.
desktop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location referenced is where one might place papers, implying that it is a work or study area. Cupboards and shelves are unlikely places to put papers, and while a table or kitchen might contain papers, they are not specifically designed for them. A desktop, on the other hand, is a common workspace that can easily become cluttered with papers and is often the site of spills if a coffee mug is placed there.
falling | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's love for climbing eventually led to a brain injury. The most likely cause of a brain injury while climbing would be from falling, as it is a common risk associated with climbing. The other options, such as getting higher or ascending, may be related to climbing but do not necessarily lead to brain injuries. Loss of oxygen and blisters may also be risks of climbing, but they are not typically associated with brain injuries.
exhaustion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bobby became sick due to doing too much physical work or exertion. The word "exhaustion" directly relates to the context of the sentence and is a common cause of illness when one works too hard. The other options like sneezing, itchiness, allergies, and cleanliness do not have any direct connection to the context of the sentence.
dictionary | Knowledge: A dictionary is a reference book that provides definitions and explanations for words. Since "lemur" is not a commonly known word, it would be necessary to look it up in a reference book like a dictionary to learn what it means. The other options (house, hole, wilderness, sunshine) do not provide any relevant information about what a lemur is.
flour | Knowledge: Bread is typically made using flour as the main ingredient. Yeast is also an important ingredient in bread-making, as it causes the dough to rise and creates air pockets in the bread. An oven is needed to bake the bread, but it is not an ingredient. A bread pan is also used to shape the bread, but it is not an ingredient. A kitchen light is not relevant to the question.
rowboat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the method of transportation being discussed is suitable for crossing water in a popular state. Only rowboats are commonly used for leisurely boating on lakes and rivers, making them the most likely choice for this question. The other options are not practical for crossing waterways or have no connection to the context of the sentence.
puncture wound | Knowledge: The comparison in the sentence suggests that like owning a kitten, there is a specific danger associated with participating in the sport of fencing. Fencing involves the use of sharp, pointed weapons and can therefore result in puncture wounds if proper safety measures are not taken. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the specific dangers of fencing.
evening | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fun they had lasted for a short period of time. The phrase "blink of an eye" is often used to describe something that happened quickly or suddenly. Since Christmas, morning, and before noon do not relate to the time of day mentioned in the sentence, they can be eliminated as options. Before lunch could be a possible answer, but evening is a better option because it implies that the fun lasted until the end of the day.
good at | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that everyone was at the finals for a reason, implying that they had some sort of skill or talent that allowed them to reach that stage. The phrase "good at" suggests that the competition was related to a specific skill or activity, such as a sport or game. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for why the individuals would have made it to the finals.
shopping mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are plenty of local food choices in the area, making it seem strange to have a fast food restaurant there. However, the presence of many people implies that there is still a demand for fast food. Shopping malls are often places with a lot of foot traffic and a mix of local and chain restaurants, making it a likely location for a fast food restaurant with many local options nearby. The other options, like big cities or specific locations, do not add any information that makes them the most likely choice.
meet friends | Knowledge: The context of the question implies that it is related to the experience of going back to school. On the first day of school, people often want to reconnect with old friends they haven't seen during the summer break and make new friends too. The other options - crossing the street, saying words, and dying of cancer - do not have any logical connection to the context, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. The option 'learn' may be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as 'meet friends,' which is suggested by the context of the question.
weight loss | Knowledge: Running is a popular exercise choice for people looking to lose weight because it is a high-intensity cardiovascular activity that burns calories quickly. Running also helps to improve overall fitness levels, which can contribute to weight loss by increasing metabolism and reducing body fat. The other options are not typically associated with reasons for taking up running and may even be negative outcomes from running such as stitches or heart attacks.
pantry or refrigerator | Knowledge: Tupperware containers are often used for storing and preserving food, so they are commonly found in places where food is stored. The pantry is one likely option, as it is where non-perishable food items are typically stored. The refrigerator is also a common location for Tupperware containers, as it is where perishable food items are typically stored to keep them fresh. The other options, such as kitchens and stoves, are too broad and do not provide any specific information about where Tupperware containers might be located.
head table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the host took a seat in a specific location for the meal. The option "welcome guests" refers to the action of greeting people, while "expect company" hints at preparing for upcoming visitors, neither of which is relevant to the context. "Sofa" refers to a piece of furniture, and "spring for dinner" refers to paying for a meal, neither of which provide any information about where the host sat. The phrase "head table" specifically refers to the table at which the host sits during an event or meal, making it the correct answer.
ground | Knowledge: Holes made by animals are typically found in the ground, as many animals dig burrows or create holes to create shelter, store food, or protect their young. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - traps are man-made objects used to capture animals, golf courses are well-manicured areas where golfers play, walls are vertical structures, and Swiss cheese is a type of cheese.
museum | Knowledge: Museums often have exhibits or displays that are fragile or valuable and require a controlled environment, so they may have rules prohibiting pets or animals from entering. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
conference | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that tables are required when multiple thoughts or ideas need to be discussed, which is a common requirement in conference settings where meetings or discussions need to take place. Picnics, fast food restaurants, houses, and weddings do not typically involve the need for tables to facilitate discussions around a variety of thoughts.
every building | Knowledge: This question is asking for a general answer about what type of structures have doorways. The correct answer is "every building" because all buildings have entrances with doorways, regardless of their purpose or design. The other options are specific types of structures that may have doorways, but not all of them necessarily do (e.g. a wall does not have a doorway).
building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lights were needed in an office, which would typically be located indoors in a building. The option "they were installed outside" contradicts the context of the sentence, as the sentence refers specifically to an office. The options "carnival," "heat table," and "plane" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
intangible | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student had difficulty grasping the concept because it was described as corporeal, which means physical or tangible. The choices "spiritual" and "incorporeal" describe ideas that are not physically tangible, so they do not fit the context of the sentence. "Insubstantial" is a possibility, but it is not as strongly associated with the idea of being intangible as "intangible" itself.
travel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally and Jim were concerned about their pets being in the back of the van during some sort of trip or journey. The other options (get cold, lie down, move, feel pain) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
kitchen | Knowledge: The kitchen is a common area in a house where fires may occur due to cooking-related accidents. Therefore, it is recommended to keep a fire extinguisher handy in the kitchen. The other options do not have any clear connection to fire safety or the context of the question.
enjoy  | Knowledge: The word "enjoy" suggests a positive experience associated with eating hamburgers. It implies that the person finds the taste satisfying and enjoyable, which would make them want more. The option "tasty" also suggests a positive experience with the flavor of hamburgers, but it is less specific than "enjoy." The options "health problems" and "indigestion" suggest negative consequences associated with hamburgers that would make someone not want more, while "hunger" is a neutral option that doesn't provide a clear reason for wanting more.
forest | Knowledge: Beavers are semi-aquatic animals that primarily inhabit forested areas near bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and millponds. They are not typically found in strip clubs or zoos.
crash | Knowledge: The word "get rid of" suggests that the person no longer has their car, indicating that something happened to it. The choice "crash" makes the most sense in this context since a car accident could damage the vehicle enough to make it unusable or too expensive to repair. The other options do not provide any clear reasoning for why someone would get rid of their car.
eat cake | Knowledge: This question is asking for a common way that couples celebrate their marriage, and eating cake is a well-known tradition often associated with weddings. Couples typically have a cake cutting ceremony during their reception as a symbolic gesture of sharing their happiness and beginning a new life together. Getting drunk or having sex may be choices some couples make, but they are not universal traditions like eating cake. Cleaning rooms and drinking too much do not have any clear connection to marriage celebration.
refreshment | Knowledge: The question is asking for a synonym or another word that means the same thing as "drink". Refreshment is a commonly used word to refer to drinks or beverages that are intended to quench one's thirst or provide temporary relief from hot weather or physical exertion. The other options in the list do not have any relation to the meaning of the word "drink".
lake | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boats in question are not on the ocean, so it is unlikely that they would be traveling across the surface of the ocean. The word "lake" is a common type of body of water that boats could travel across. "Tetrahedron" and "object" are not types of bodies of water, and "mirror" does not make sense in this context.
landscape | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that climbing a hill while hiking can lead to an appreciation of something. Since "countryside," "Virginia," and "price" do not relate to appreciation, these options can be eliminated. "Great outdoors" is a general term that does not specify what aspect of nature one might appreciate while hiking. "Landscape," on the other hand, refers to the visible features of an area of land, which could include mountains, trees, rivers, and other natural elements. Therefore, "landscape" is the best answer, as it relates directly to the act of hiking and the appreciation one might gain from being immersed in nature.
roadblock | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police were trying to prevent someone or something from leaving town, and they used force to do so. The most appropriate option in this context would be a roadblock, which is a physical barrier used to stop traffic and control access to a particular area. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: war and military base imply a much larger conflict than the situation described, while sporting goods store and fun are completely unrelated.
renewal | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the individual has a library card that may stop working if they do not complete a certain form. The correct answer is "renewal" because library cards often have expiration dates that require the cardholder to renew it by filling out a form. The other options do not make sense in the context of renewing a library card.
gaining knowledge | Knowledge: The question is asking about seeking more information, which suggests a desire to gain knowledge. The other options either refer to a specific type of knowledge (e.g. wisdom), or suggest negative consequences (e.g. headaches) that are not associated with seeking information.
construction business | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sammy's profession requires union membership for advancement, which is commonly associated with the construction industry. Union membership is often required in the construction business as it provides workers with leverage to negotiate for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tastes better than storebought | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason the person enjoyed making bread is because homemade bread tastes better than storebought bread. This is a common sentiment among people who enjoy baking their own bread, as they often appreciate the unique taste and texture of homemade bread. The other options may be related to bread-making or eating, but they do not directly connect to the reason the person enjoyed making bread.
the zoo | Knowledge: The question suggests that the marmoset is an animal that is typically found in captivity, which would make the zoo a likely answer. The other options either refer to uninhabited areas or places outside of the geographic scope of the question, and therefore do not provide a likely answer.
terrorism | Knowledge: ISIS is a terrorist group known for carrying out violent attacks in various parts of the world. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not accurately describe the actions or beliefs of individuals in ISIS.
new york | Knowledge: The question is asking for a city on the east coast known for their pizzerias. The option "new york" is the most likely answer as it is widely known for its pizza, with many famous pizzerias located in the city. The other options do not have any clear connection to the question. Chicago is also known for its pizza, but it is not located on the east coast.
use |  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Major Tom believed that the weapons could be useful in the future. The word "preserve" implies that he wanted to keep them safe and intact for a specific purpose. Therefore, the correct answer is "use." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Street," "ruin," and "waste" are all negative outcomes, while "rot" implies that the weapons would deteriorate and become unusable over time.
canteen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person brought a cup of coffee on the hike instead of water, which implies that they had some sort of container to carry the coffee in. Canteens are a type of container typically used for carrying water or other beverages on hikes or camping trips, so it makes sense that this is the correct answer. The other options (deli, kitchen, office, and diner) do not have any clear connection to hiking or carrying beverages.
neighbor's house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the garage is located nearby, as the person can see it from their own house. The option "neighbor's house" is the most logical choice, as it is common for garages to be located next to or near houses. The other options, such as motor park, building or downtown, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "modern house" may be a possibility, but there is no clear indication in the sentence that the garage is attached or part of a modern house.
vomiting | Knowledge: The phrase "rotten food" suggests that the food is spoiled and therefore unsafe to eat. If someone were to eat this food, they would likely experience nausea and vomiting as their body tries to expel the toxic substance. The options of "mess," "joy," "contentment," and "pleasure" do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not related to the idea of eating spoiled food.
theater | Knowledge: A concert hall is a type of building designed for musical performances, but it can also be used as a theater for plays and other performances. Both music and theater require a large stage and good acoustics, which are features that are commonly found in concert halls. The other options (commercial building, university building, screaming, and city) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
music store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the banjo was produced and then sent off for sale. It also specifies that it was meant for retail, which usually refers to the consumer market. Based on this information, the most likely destination for the banjo would be a music store, which is a typical place for consumers to buy musical instruments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - the United States is too general, an office would usually not be a place where musical instruments are sold, and a jug band is a type of musical group, not a store.
eat food | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fat child has a tendency to consume food uncontrollably, which is why they cannot be trusted around food. The phrase "there was only one thing it would do" implies that the child's behavior is predictable and singular in nature. "Eating" is a possible choice, but it is not as specific as "eating food." "Vomit" and "prepare" are not reasonable options based on the context of the sentence. "Say grace" is also unlikely, as it does not relate to the child's behavior around food.
garage | Knowledge: The question implies that the best place to store boxes of spare automobile parts should be a location that is easily accessible and can provide protection from the elements. The garage is a popular location to store spare parts because it is typically attached to the house, making it easily accessible, and it is also protected from the elements, such as rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. The other options may not provide adequate protection from the elements or may be difficult to access.
tidepools | Knowledge: Crabs are commonly found in tidepools, which are rocky pools of seawater that are left behind as the tide goes out. Moving to a location with access to tidepools would therefore increase John's chances of being able to catch crabs. The other options either have no connection to the context of the sentence or are unlikely to be places where crabs could be caught.
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that regardless of how one chooses to live life, it all ends the same way. The concept of death being the inevitable end of life is a common theme in many belief systems and philosophies. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not have the same sense of finality and inevitability as death.
jet lag | Knowledge: Jet lag is a common experience for travelers who cross multiple time zones, as their body's internal clock becomes disrupted and out of sync with the new time zone. Symptoms of jet lag can include fatigue, insomnia, and difficulty concentrating. None of the other options offer a likely explanation for what happens when traveling to a new time zone.
hand lotion | Knowledge: Sanitizer can dry out the skin, so someone who uses it frequently might use a moisturizer to counteract this effect. Hand lotion is a commonly used moisturizer for the hands, and it makes sense as an option in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of sanitizer or moisturizer.
India | Knowledge: The mention of a temple and shaved heads suggests that the answer is related to a religious practice, specifically in Hinduism or Buddhism. Nepal and the Middle East do not have a strong association with these religions. The Jewish community doesn't typically practice head shaving in temples, and Timbuktu is not known for its Buddhist or Hindu temples. India, on the other hand, is home to numerous temples where men may shave their heads as part of their religious practice.
going to prison | Knowledge: Committing murder is a serious crime, and the punishment for it typically involves imprisonment. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is either "going to prison" or "jail time." "Feeling sad" and "feeling of guilt" are emotional responses and not a legal punishment. "Go to jail" is very similar to "going to prison," so it could also be a correct answer, though "going to prison" is more commonly used in legal contexts.
good behavior | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question has been recognized for not getting into trouble, which implies that they have exhibited good behavior. The word "certificate" also suggests some sort of recognition or award for good behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
New Mexico | Knowledge: The adjective "dry" suggests that the lizard can be found in a location with low humidity, such as a desert. Among the answer choices, only "New Mexico" and "dessert" (sic) could be considered deserts. However, "dessert" is misspelled, and the question asks for the name of a state, not a type of environment. Therefore, the correct answer must be "New Mexico," which is a state that is partially located in the Chihuahuan Desert. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
study medicine | Knowledge: Obtaining an MD (Doctor of Medicine) requires extensive education and training, which includes studying medicine in depth. Providing care and resuscitating patients are activities that doctors may perform after obtaining their MD, but they are not requirements for getting the degree. Letting blood and distancing oneself do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
key | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person returning to work will need something to get in the door, which implies that the door is locked and requires a physical key to unlock it. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence or do not make sense in this context.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the word "normal location" refers to a place where houses are typically found, which is the surface of the earth (as opposed to other, less common places like in the ocean or in outer space). The other options are either too specific (China, subdivision) or too unrelated (newspaper, street) to be the correct answer.
going out at night | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about ways in which young adult friends can have fun. Going out at night is a common activity for young adults to socialize and enjoy themselves. Poker and cleaning may not be as appealing to many young adults, while jump rope and telling stories may be more suitable for children rather than young adults.
stay still | Knowledge: The sentence explains that Miranda was having difficulty remaining stationary, which is why she couldn't stop moving her feet. The fact that her feet were smelly suggests that she may have taken off her shoes, which emphasizes the importance of staying still. The other options do not make sense given the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the issue at hand.
religious | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the atheist is promoting secular thought, which is a worldview that is not influenced by religious beliefs. Therefore, he is likely disagreeing with the ideas associated with religion, such as the belief in an eternal deity, the importance of the church, or the monastic way of life. The word "unpredictable" does not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
expectation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that surprising people can help to minimize something that they want to avoid. The word "prepping" implies that some kind of preparation or advance warning is involved, which might lead to people having certain expectations. By surprising them instead, those expectations can be minimized. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
commercial | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoyed watching something on television, and that it was a type of program that had advertising in it. The word "sloth" may suggest that the program was about animals or nature, which often have commercials promoting related products or services. The other options do not have any clear connection to watching something on television with commercials.
proper diet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking medicine alone is not sufficient for the patient's well-being. This implies that there may be external factors that also need to be addressed to ensure the patient's health. Proper diet is a common recommendation given by doctors, as it can have a significant impact on one's health. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the sentence.
loud | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to make sure their voice is heard by everyone, which implies speaking loudly. The other options do not provide any clear indication of how to achieve the desired outcome of being heard by everyone.
ship's hold | Knowledge: The question is asking for a synonym for "cargo", which is the term used to describe goods being transported by a vehicle. The other options are not related to the context of transporting goods, and therefore do not fit the definition of "cargo". "Ship's hold" specifically refers to the area on a ship where cargo is stored during transportation, making it the correct answer.
having fun | Knowledge: The question implies that playing a game has some sort of outcome or effect. The option "having fun" is a common reason people play games and is a positive outcome, while "fall down" is unlikely and not related to playing a game. "Stress" could be a result of playing a difficult or competitive game, but it is not always the case. "Competition" is a characteristic of many games, but it is not a direct effect on the player. "Entertain" could be a reason someone plays a game, but it does not indicate a specific outcome or effect on the player.
work | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that returning to work was easy for Dan after his treatment. This implies that he was ready to resume his normal routine and was able to work without difficulty or hesitation. The other options do not make sense in this context - sobering refers to something that is serious and thought-provoking, painless refers to a lack of pain, malaise refers to a sense of discomfort or unease, and boredom refers to a lack of interest or stimulation.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: Jim was looking for a container cup, which suggests that he was searching for a specific type of container. The options "person's hand" and "drink from" do not involve a separate container, while "sink" and "dispenser" do not specify that they are cups. "Kitchen cupboard" is the most appropriate option as it is a common location for storing cups and containers in a traditional home setting.
car | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mode of transportation they used was not within walking distance, which rules out options like energy and fire. The use of "took" suggests they used a method of transportation rather than generating energy or creating fire themselves. Additionally, the most common mode of transportation for longer distances that is not within walking distance is a car. The option "they cannot took for sleeping and travelling" is not a valid answer as it does not make sense grammatically.
regenerate | Knowledge: The word "rest" in this context implies taking a break to recover and rebuild strength. The choice that best fits this meaning is "regenerate," which means to restore or renew something. The other choices either do not fit the context or do not convey the same meaning as "rest." For example, "weak" is an adjective describing a state of being and does not fit as a possible answer to this question.
prosecution | Knowledge: When a person is accused of committing a crime, they will typically face prosecution in court. This means that the government or state will bring charges against them and try to prove their guilt. Options like "incarceration" and "imprisonment" refer to the consequence of being found guilty, rather than the legal process itself. "Benedict Cumberbatch" and "problems" are unrelated to the topic and can be eliminated as options.
large city | Knowledge: Expressways are highways designed for high-speed, high-volume traffic flow in urban areas. Cities are often more densely populated than rural areas, which means there are more people using the roads, leading to congestion and traffic jams. Canada and Michigan are not specific enough to suggest whether expressways are likely to be crowded or not, while "country" is too broad and doesn't have any specific connection to expressways. Therefore, the correct answer is "large city."
desert | Knowledge: The use of the word "oasis" suggests that the location being described is a desert, as an oasis is a rare and valuable source of water in arid regions. Additionally, the choices of "hop garden," "wasteland," "parking lot," and "sand dune" do not fit the description of a lush and beautiful garden oasis, making "desert" the most likely choice.
window sill | Knowledge: Cats are often known for their love of basking in the sun. Therefore, it is likely that they would seek out a location with easy access to sunlight. A window sill is often an ideal spot as it is raised and can provide a comfortable place for a cat to relax, soak up sunlight, and keep an eye on their surroundings. The other options do not have a clear connection to providing sunlight or being conducive to the habits of a cat.
asking for money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Johnny doesn't like to ask his brother for money, but he still does it anyway. This implies that the action that Johnny finds himself doing is asking for money, rather than any of the other choices which involve work or employment. Threatening also doesn't fit the context, as there is no indication that Johnny is using any kind of force or coercion to get the money.
art museum  | Knowledge: This question is asking for a location that would have many galleries in one place, making an art museum the most likely answer. Art museums often have multiple galleries featuring different collections, allowing visitors to see a wide variety of artwork in one location. The other options may have galleries but do not provide the same concentration of art in one place.
forceful | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the laser light caused physical discomfort to the person, suggesting that it had a strong, intense quality. "Forceful" is the most appropriate choice to describe this sensation. "Darkness" and "cumbersome" do not relate to the context, while "crucial" and "cold" are unlikely descriptions for a laser light that hurts someone's eyes.
machine gun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cadets were learning about the parts of a machine gun and were then required to disassemble and reassemble it, which is a common training exercise for military personnel. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
blackouts | Knowledge: Drinking alcohol can affect memory and impair cognitive function, leading to blackouts or gaps in memory where the individual is unable to recall events that occurred while they were under the influence. Bad breath and frequent urination may be side effects of alcohol consumption, but they do not specifically relate to the timeframe of finishing the alcohol. Getting pregnant is not a possible outcome of drinking alcohol, but forgetting if precautions were taken to prevent pregnancy could be a symptom of forgetfulness caused by alcohol consumption.
windmill | Knowledge: The sentence describes an object that is turned by moving air, which is a common feature of windmills. Windmills use the power of the wind to generate electricity or produce mechanical power. The other options, such as propellers and rollerblades, do not typically use wind as a source of power.
Rain forest | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about where a monkey is likely to live if it has been caught, which implies that the monkey is not in its natural habitat. Rain forests are tropical areas that are known to be natural habitats for monkeys, so it is likely that a caught monkey will be taken to a rain forest to live, at least to begin with. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
american army | Knowledge: The sound of a bugle in the mornings is typically associated with the military, particularly the American Army. Bugles are used to signal various military activities such as reveille, which is the signal for soldiers to wake up and start their day. The other options such as Boys Scout, brass band, and army corps are not typically associated with morning bugle calls. The option for military band is a possibility, but the use of "American Army" in the question suggests a specific context that points towards this answer.
cry | Knowledge: The question is asking for a possible immediate reaction to sadness, and crying is a common emotional response to feeling sad. The other options do not necessarily make sense as immediate reactions to sadness. Getting drunk or taking a phone call may be ways to distract from sadness or cope with it, but they do not represent an immediate emotional response. Listening to music could be a coping mechanism, but it does not necessarily follow that a person will do this immediately after feeling sad.
chicken coop | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the farmer was concerned about protecting a specific area from intruders, and the choice of "fox proof" indicates that the intruders were likely animals. Of the options provided, a chicken coop is the most commonly protected area on a farm and is often fortified against predators such as foxes. The other options, while they may contain animals that could be threatened by foxes, do not necessarily need to be made fox proof.
order dinner | Knowledge: Since Sally was able to get a table early, it suggests that she arrived at the restaurant during a slower time when tables were available. Therefore, it is likely that she would have ordered her meal after being seated. The other options, such as taking a number, paying bills, or waiting in line, are not relevant to the situation because Sally has already been seated at a table. Finishing dessert could be a possibility, but it would depend on whether she had already eaten a meal or not.
die | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy is against killing people, and because the sentence includes the word "people," it makes sense that the answer would be related to a person's ultimate fate. Therefore, the correct answer is "die." The other options may be consequences of killing someone, but they do not directly relate to the act of killing itself.
public building | Knowledge: A court is a formal legal institution that carries out legal proceedings, rulings, and judgments. It is typically located in a public building that is specifically designated for this purpose. Options like a city, gymnasium, inside, and palace are too generic and do not provide any context that suggests a court could be located there.
fort  | Knowledge: The word "safe" suggests that the king was in danger or facing some kind of threat. A fort is a structure designed to provide protection and defense, making it the most logical choice for where the king would go to feel safe. The other options such as castle or throne room do not imply the same level of protection as a fort. The deck of cards and court have no connection to the theme of safety.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is trying to save money while getting a drink, which suggests that they are likely at a place where drinks are expensive. Nightclubs and bars in Miami, Las Vegas, and New York City are often known for having high drink prices, which would contradict the person's goal of saving money. A restaurant, on the other hand, may have a bar area where drinks are cheaper than at a dedicated bar or nightclub.
barber shop | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is unhappy with their hair, and is suggesting a solution to this problem. The most logical solution would be to visit a place where professionals specialize in cutting and styling hair - which is a barber shop. The other options, such as a person's head or a fur rug, do not make sense in this context. Moustache and mammals are also irrelevant to the question since they don't address the problem of not liking one's hair.
cupboard | Knowledge: A cupboard is typically used to store kitchen items such as pots and pans, so it would make sense to place a pot in the cupboard if it is not currently needed. The other options, such as a restaurant, greenhouse, or porch, do not have any clear connection to storing a pot. A refrigerator is also unlikely because it is usually reserved for storing perishable items such as food and beverages.
get cold | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scenario involves both kissing and snow, which typically suggests that the environment is cold. Snowfall is associated with low temperatures, so it is likely that being outside in a snowstorm while kissing would result in feeling cold, rather than becoming sexually aroused or excited. The other options may be possible outcomes of kissing, but they are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monkey is in close proximity to the person who is searching for it, indicating that it is likely a pet or being kept in someone's home. The other options do not provide any indication of where a monkey might be found in the United States.
armed forces | Knowledge: A company of people typically refers to a group of soldiers in the armed forces. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. The yellow pages, marketplace, and newspaper may contain information about companies, but not a company of people specifically. A city may have a company or organization, but it is not the primary association with the term.
shower | Knowledge: The question specifically asks where you would mount a towel that you wanted above your shower, indicating that the answer must be a location near or above the shower area. The options washing machine, gym, swimming pool, and roof do not fit this criteria. The option dryer is also unlikely as it would not typically be located in the bathroom.
bedroom | Knowledge: The question suggests that the options relate to a place where clothes can be folded. The laundry room is primarily used for washing and drying clothes and the suitcase is typically used for packing clothes for travel. The closet and dresser are used for storing clothes once they have been folded. The bedroom, on the other hand, is a more likely location for folding clothes, as it is often where people keep their laundry baskets and have a large enough space for folding clothes.
strength | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people were able to move the car using only their physical abilities, which indicates that they possessed a significant amount of strength. The other options would not explain how the people were able to move the car, as they are either too general (energy, force, drive) or not relevant to the situation (mood).
concentrate | Knowledge: The question suggests that the ability to think for a long time requires a certain mental skill or focus. "Concentrate" is the most logical option as it directly relates to the ability to focus and think deeply. "Sit quietly" and "relax" may help create a conducive environment for concentration, but they are not the actual skill needed for thinking. "Know first" is not relevant in this context, and "drink" may actually hinder one's ability to think deeply.
shrinking | Knowledge: Snow is made of water, and when it gets wet, it starts to melt. When a snowman begins to melt, the snow will start to shrink and lose its shape. Therefore, it is likely that a snowman that is getting wet will shrink. The other options either do not make sense in the given context or are not likely outcomes when a snowman gets wet.
use television | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a remote control, which is commonly used to operate a TV. The sentence also suggests that the child was learning and discovering new things, which is an indication that they were probably young and inexperienced. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence.
disneyland | Knowledge: The question is asking about the origin of a famous cartoon mouse, which suggests that the mouse is likely to be a fictional character created by a popular media franchise. Disneyland is a well-known theme park and entertainment complex owned by the Walt Disney Company, which is famous for creating numerous beloved animated characters, including Mickey Mouse. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question, as they do not relate to the creation or origin of a cartoon mouse.
season with salt | Knowledge: When cooking is almost complete, it is common for cooks to add salt to the dish to enhance its flavor. Salt helps to bring out the natural flavors of the ingredients and can also balance out any spice or acidity in the dish. The other options listed do not necessarily apply to the end stages of cooking. "Prepare meals" is too general and could apply at any stage, "mix in a bowl" could apply to any step of the recipe, "brown meat" could be done much earlier in the cooking process, and "better food" is not an action item for the cook to take.
drop to zero | Knowledge: The sentence states that "things get colder," which implies temperature is decreasing. The option "increase" contradicts this information. "Heat up" implies an increase in temperature, which is also contradictory. "Dropping quickly" is too vague and doesn't specify a specific point, while "arctic" refers to a region and not a temperature change. "Drop to zero" is the only option that accurately reflects a decrease in temperature, which aligns with the information provided in the sentence.
natural world | Knowledge: The term "natural world" refers to the physical environment and everything in it, including living organisms like people and creatures like jellyfish. "Humanity" and "society" are specifically related to human beings and do not include jellyfish. "Headache" is a medical condition that has nothing to do with the natural world, and while "nature" is related to the environment, it does not necessarily include specific organisms like jellyfish.
inspiration | Knowledge: The fact that James ran out of the room to get a pen and paper indicates that he experienced something that inspired him to write or draw something down. This suggests that the correct answer is "inspiration." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that James experienced discomfort, love, or saw a car that led him to run out of the room. "Fun" may be a possible option, but it is less likely than "inspiration" given that James felt compelled to write or draw something down.
store, house, candle | Knowledge: An artificial light source is anything that produces light but is not a natural source of light such as the sun, moon or stars. Examples include electric lights found in stores and houses, as well as candles. Books and the sky do not produce light and are not considered artificial light sources.
heartburn | Knowledge: Spicy food is known to cause heartburn in some people, as it can irritate the lining of the esophagus and stomach. This can lead to a burning sensation in the chest or throat, which is commonly referred to as heartburn. The other options, such as medium (which could refer to the level of spiciness), illness, throwing up, or sleepiness, are not specific to the effects of spicy food.
sleep soundly | Knowledge: The sentence implies that dogs are on guard and vigilant for intruders, suggesting that their behavior changes when there are no intruders around. The most likely behavior for dogs in this situation would be to sleep soundly, indicating that they are relaxed and not on alert. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the concept of intruders or the behavior of dogs when there is no perceived threat.
department store | Knowledge: A department store typically sells a wide variety of products, including clothing accessories like purses and larger items like TVs. Handbag is another word for purse, but it doesn't fit the context in which an additional item like a TV could also be purchased. Pocket and home are not types of stores where items are sold.
bowling alley | Knowledge: The word "gutters" is commonly associated with bowling alleys because they are the channels located on either side of the lane that catch balls that veer off course. When a ball is thrown too far to one side, it will roll into the gutter and not make it all the way down the lane. Therefore, gutters prevent a ball from becoming a runway in a bowling alley. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
triple crown | Knowledge: The context suggests that the horse winning many races is aiming for a specific achievement. The Triple Crown is a prestigious award given to horses that win three specific races: the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. Therefore, the correct answer is "triple crown." The other options, except for Kentucky Derby, are not related to horse racing.
worship idols | Knowledge: Bowing before a statue is a common act of worship in many religions and cultures. It is often done to show respect, honor, and reverence towards a deity or an idol. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jerseys | Knowledge: The sentence mentions "sporting goods store", which suggests that the items being sold are related to sports. The phrase "uniform tops" implies that the item is a shirt or jersey commonly worn by athletes as part of a team uniform. The option "baseball" is a specific sport that often requires players to wear jerseys, further supporting the answer choice. The other options, such as "town" or "city", are not related to sports or apparel. "Retail shopping district" is too general and does not provide any specific information to help answer the question.
go to sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being tired leads to the need for something specific, even when in a car or chair. Snoring, reading a book, and having a rest are not necessarily related to the specific need being referenced in the sentence. Going to bed and going to sleep are closely related ideas, but "going to bed" implies a longer period of time, whereas "going to sleep" can happen quickly and easily, even in a seated position. Therefore, "go to sleep" is the most appropriate answer.
going to court | Knowledge: "Bringing suit" is a legal term that refers to initiating a legal action or lawsuit against someone. Therefore, the correct answer is "going to court", as this is the only option that relates to the legal implication of bringing suit. "Ruling" may be a consequence of bringing suit, but not the reason why someone would initiate a legal action. "Great expense" and "aggravation" may also be consequences of bringing suit, but again, not the reason why someone would initiate a legal action. "Randomness" does not have any clear relationship to the context of the question.
box | Knowledge: Since Sarah is described as not owning a computer or monitor, it is likely that the "thing" connected to her TV serves a similar function. The term "box" is commonly used to refer to devices that can connect to televisions, such as game consoles or streaming devices. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for what the device connected to the TV might be.
ocean | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the body of water being referred to is large and connected to multiple rivers. The only option that fits this description is an ocean, as it is a vast body of water connected to numerous rivers that flow into and out of it. The other options are much smaller bodies of water, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
better understanding | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the scientist is analyzing the data from the lab results. The phrase "better understanding" is the only option that fits with this context, as the scientist is likely analyzing the data to gain a deeper comprehension or insight into something. The other choices do not make sense in this context: "learn more about" is redundant since the scientist already has the lab results; "headache" and "do math" are nonsensical; and "enlightened" is too philosophical and unrelated to the scientific process.
impossible | Knowledge: The term "faster than light" refers to a speed faster than the speed of light, which is the fastest known speed in the universe. Known science suggests that it is impossible to achieve such a speed, which is why the term "impossible" is the most appropriate choice for the question. The other options may suggest a degree of uncertainty or doubt, but the word "impossible" is a strong and definitive statement that aligns with the known laws of physics.
blisters | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shoes are too tight, which can cause rubbing and friction on the skin of the feet. This friction can lead to blisters, which are small, fluid-filled pockets that form on the skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
countryside | Knowledge: The term "dirt highway" suggests a rural or less developed area where the roads may not be paved. The word "countryside" is the only option that fits this description. "Atlas" refers to a book of maps and has no relevance to the context of the sentence. "Repairs" and "in the city" do not fit the rural setting suggested by "dirt highway." "United States" is too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location of a dirt highway.
mate | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the purpose of a bird's nest is to lay eggs, which is done after the bird has mated. Therefore, the correct answer is "mate." The other options do not provide a logical explanation for why birds make nests.
Washington | Knowledge: The question asks for a state that has a county called Columbia and is the furthest in the direction that the sun sets. Based on geography, Washington is a state in the Pacific Time Zone, which means it is further west than Tennessee, Missouri, and South Carolina. Canada is not a state, but a country. Therefore, Washington is the only plausible answer. Additionally, Washington does have a county named Columbia.
ditch | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was seeking shelter from a tornado when he found the snake on the ground. It is possible that the snake was hiding or seeking shelter in a ditch as well, which would provide protection from the strong winds of the tornado. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sewing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned is skilled with needles, which is a key tool used in sewing. Additionally, the other two hobbies mentioned (needlepoint and crocheting) are also related to sewing and textiles. The other options (sewing machine, art store, frame, livingroom) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
boredom | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the reason for stopping at a hotel is related to a lack of entertainment or stimulation, which is commonly associated with boredom. Traffic accidents, injuries, and fatigue are reasons for stopping on the side of the road, but not necessarily at a hotel. Sleepiness could be a reason for stopping at a hotel, but it is not directly related to the context of the sentence.
on the internet | Knowledge: The term "information superhighway" is commonly used to refer to the internet, which is a global network of computers connected together. The phrase "cyberspace" is also frequently used to describe the internet, but it is not as commonly used as "information superhighway." "Heavily travelled area" and "industrialized country" are not relevant to the question, and "computer network" is too broad and does not specifically refer to the internet.
wallflower | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that most kids were actively participating in the dance, but one shy kid was not. The phrase "found himself a" suggests that this shy kid became something, and "wallflower" is a common term for someone who is at a dance but not actively participating, usually standing against a wall. The other options do not fit the context of someone who is at a dance but not participating.
books | Knowledge: Fictional words are typically found in works of fiction, such as novels, short stories, and poetry. While newspapers may contain some creative writing, they are primarily focused on reporting factual information. The mouth and sentence options do not make sense in the context of finding fictional words. "In the package" is too vague and does not provide any clear connection to the question.
long skirt | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the school dress code for girls was strict and required a specific type of clothing. The option "pants" and "trousers" are unlikely to be the correct answer because they are typically associated with male clothing, and the sentence specifically mentions "girls." "Pant" is an incorrect spelling of "pants." "Naked" is clearly incorrect and inappropriate for a school dress code. Therefore, "long skirt" is the most likely correct answer.
nursing home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the elderly resident is staying somewhere and that illness is a common way for their stay to end. The most likely place for an elderly resident to stay is in a nursing home, as they provide care for seniors who need assistance with daily living activities. Hospitals are typically where people go for medical treatment, not long-term care, and the options "sick person" and "grave yard" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Brain" is also unrelated to the sentence.
fear | Knowledge: Saw is a horror film known for its grotesque and terrifying depictions of violence and torture. When watching a horror movie like Saw, viewers are likely experiencing fear, as the film's goal is to evoke a visceral emotional response. The other options do not accurately reflect the experience of watching a horror film like Saw.
take money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there will be consequences if you fail to file your taxes, which typically involves paying money that you owe. The option "get money" does not make sense in this context since the government is not acquiring money, but rather, you are being required to pay. "School children" and "serve public" are not related to taxes at all. "Forgive you" is unlikely since the government generally does not forgive unpaid taxes. The most reasonable option is "take money" since the government can enforce penalties and fines for failing to file taxes, which involves taking money from you.
supporter | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy had a relationship with his opponent, despite their differences. Therefore, it makes sense that he may still want to support them even after losing the primary. "Proponent" and "advocate" may also suggest support, but they do not necessarily apply in this specific context. "Falling down" and "dig up skeletons" do not have any connection to the sentence's meaning.
homeless shelter | Knowledge: Homeless shelters are typically known as places where homeless individuals can go to receive basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. In contrast, a sanctuary is typically thought of as a place of refuge or safety, but not necessarily one that provides food. Similarly, parks and bridges are not typically associated with providing food to those in need. Bus depots may offer some food options, but it is not their primary function.
motherboard | Knowledge: The sentence describes the part of a computer that holds the memory and processing chips, which is the motherboard. A motherboard is an essential component of a computer that connects and controls all the other parts. The other options, such as pantry, bar, casino, and supermarket, do not have any association with computer hardware.
long life | Knowledge: Staying healthy is often associated with living a longer life. Leading a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking and heavy drinking can increase longevity and reduce the risk of chronic diseases that can shorten one's life span. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
soft | Knowledge: The question is asking for a word that describes the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor, which implies that this person's hands are not rough or calloused. The word "soft" is the best fit for this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
happiness | Knowledge: Playing cards is often associated with leisure and entertainment, and people typically engage in this activity to have fun and enjoy themselves. The other options, such as anger and loss of interest, do not seem to align with the purpose of playing cards. While winning money may be a secondary motivation for some players, it is not the primary reason people play cards. Therefore, happiness is the most appropriate answer.
amusement park | Knowledge: Toy balloons are often sold as souvenirs or novelties at amusement parks. Amusement parks tend to have a variety of attractions and games that cater to families with children, making them a likely place to purchase a toy balloon. The other options do not have as strong a connection to the context of purchasing a toy balloon.
bag | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman is preparing her old clothes for donation to charity, and specifically mentions that she is folding and stacking them. Given the context of sorting clothes for donation, it is likely that the woman would use a bag to hold and transport the clothes rather than a box or trunk (which may be too bulky), a basement (which is not a container), or trash (which is not appropriate for charitable donations).
Latin America | Knowledge: Marmosets are small primates that are native to Latin America. The sentence mentions that there are "millions" of them sitting in trees, which suggests that they are a common sight in the region. France and Columbia are not known for their marmoset populations, and "underground" and "dictionary" do not have any logical connection to the topic.
bathroom or bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a cold and plans to stay inside, which implies that they will likely spend most of their time in either the bathroom or bedroom. These are also the most common places to keep a tissue holder for easy access. The other options do not make sense in the given context, as a tissue holder would not be needed in a car, swimming pool, or airplane.
confusion | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when the person tried to communicate by radio, they did not understand what was being said on the other end. This indicates that there was some sort of problem with the transmission, such as interference or a weak signal. The word "confusion" implies that the message was garbled or unclear, which rules out the other options. "Static" refers to background noise on the radio, "progress" and "collaboration" have positive connotations that do not fit the context, and "sound" is too general and does not provide any additional information.
pantry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was preparing for unexpected events by stocking up on canned food, which is commonly stored in a pantry. A pantry is typically used for storing non-perishable food items, such as canned goods, which can be used in case of emergencies or when fresh food is not available. The other options, such as cellar or cupboard, may be used for storing other household items or perishable food items, but not necessarily for long-term food storage.
army bunker | Knowledge: An unused weapon would most likely be stored in a secure location, such as an army bunker. Bunkers are designed to protect weapons from damage and theft while ensuring they are easily accessible when needed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question, as weapons are not typically stored in a war or police station, and a weapon being in a hand or holster would imply it is being used or carried.
sleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was tired after a day of work and needed to rest during their lunch break. The options "go to bed", "get physical activity", and "earth" do not make sense in this context, while "have rest" and "sleep" are more appropriate options. However, "have rest" is ambiguous and could refer to resting without necessarily sleeping, whereas "sleep" specifically refers to a state of unconsciousness that would help someone recover from fatigue.
blank stares | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using complex language is not an effective way to communicate with an audience, as it is likely to cause confusion and disengagement. "Blank stares" is a common response to language that is difficult to understand, while "applause" is an unlikely response in this context. "Getting arrested" and "stage fright" are also unrelated to the topic of language use.
trouble | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone wants to end their marriage, and the word "usually" suggests that there is a common reason for this. The most common reason for wanting to end a marriage is due to trouble or issues within the relationship, such as infidelity, incompatibility, or irreconcilable differences. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence- lying may be a specific reason for wanting to end a marriage, but it is not usually the primary reason. Civil authorities, lawyers, and judges may be involved in the process of ending a marriage, but they are not the reason for it.
shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the food was packaged for sale, which means it was likely intended to be sold in a store or shop. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. It is unlikely that the food would be stored in a bathroom, kitchen, or refrigerator before being sold. The only reasonable option is a shop.
music store | Knowledge: The question asks where one could obtain an upright piano, which is typically purchased from a music store. The other options (such as a living room or house) do not make sense as they are not places where pianos are typically sold or found. New York could potentially have a music store, but it is not inherently connected to the question and therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
undivine | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person both believes in God and kills a divine entity, which may imply that the person sees the divine entity as below or inferior to God. The word "undivine" fits this context because it suggests that the entity is not divine or not worthy of being seen as divine. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
buy food | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is in need of food but does not have any available in their house. This implies that they need to acquire food from an outside source, which eliminates the options of eating breakfast or having lunch (as they would need food to make these meals). Calling a friend may provide some support or assistance, but it is not a direct solution to the problem of hunger. Eating a hamburger also requires acquiring the food, but it is not the best choice as it limits the options to only one type of food. Buying food provides the most practical and necessary solution to the problem of hunger.
endanger | Knowledge: The word "dangerous" suggests that the rescue mission carries a high risk of harm or potential danger. Therefore, "endanger" is the best answer choice as it directly relates to the potential negative outcome of such a rescue. "Corrupt," "abandon," "good time," and "bind" do not fit the context of the sentence and are incorrect answer choices.
None of the choices are correct as they do not relate to seeing a thunderstorm.  |  | Knowledge: A thunderstorm is a weather phenomenon that is often associated with dramatic lightning strikes and heavy rain. To see a thunderstorm, you would need to be outside or in a location that offers a clear view of the sky. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect.
falling off  | Knowledge: Falling off a bike is a common and potentially painful experience for a kid who is learning to ride. Children may feel scared, embarrassed, or physically hurt after taking a spill, and crying is a natural response to these emotions. Peddling and pedaling are variations of the same word, which refers to the act of moving the bike forward by turning the pedals with your feet. Stopping is a normal part of riding a bike, and should not cause a child to cry unless there is some other factor involved (such as fear of falling or frustration with the process).
toolbox | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person owns multiple tools, including wrenches and screwdrivers, and that he keeps them in a metal container. A toolbox is a common type of container used to store and organize multiple tools, while the other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. A cabinet is typically used for larger items, a basement is not a typical place to store tools, a tool shed would be an outdoor structure, and a tool kit implies a small, compact set of tools rather than a larger collection.
arboretum | Knowledge: Ficus is a type of tree commonly found in park-like settings such as arboretums or botanical gardens. Ficus trees are frequently grown for their decorative leaves and ability to add natural character to indoor and outdoor spaces. The other options are unlikely to be associated with ficus trees or be locations where they could be found in large numbers.
drawer | Knowledge: The question is asking where a good place in a home is to keep an extra eyeglasses case, implying that the case is not currently being used. Keeping it in a bag or shirt pocket would suggest that the glasses are being carried around, which is not relevant to the question. Keeping it on a desk or in a car would suggest that it is being used regularly, which is also not relevant to the question. Therefore, the best option is a drawer, which would allow for easy storage and retrieval of the case when needed.
darkness | Knowledge: The question is related to sleeping, suggesting that a specific environment is needed to ensure proper rest. Darkness is known to help trigger the release of melatonin, a hormone that controls sleep, whereas light can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. The other options do not have any clear connection to sleeping or creating a conducive sleeping environment.
telephone | Knowledge: The question is asking for a tool or device that allows for communication both ways, where one can hear and be heard. A telephone fits this description because it enables two or more people to have a conversation over a distance, using built-in speakers and microphones to transmit and receive audio signals. The other options may involve hearing or making sounds, but do not necessarily facilitate two-way communication.
ground | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker walked through an abandoned house and left footprints on the dusty ground. The other options do not make sense in the context described in the sentence - a closet or attic would not have enough space for someone to leave a clear path, a coffee maker or television would not have dust on them, and are not typically found on the ground.
air | Knowledge: The sentence compares the beauty of a snowflake falling through something, and the options provided suggest different things for the snowflake to fall through. Of the choices, only "air" is something that a falling snowflake would pass through, making it the correct answer. The other choices, such as "sky" or "winter," do not accurately describe the path of a falling snowflake.
being fired  | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lying employee will face consequences for their action, namely in the form of losing their job. Lying in the workplace is generally considered a serious offense and can result in termination or other disciplinary actions. While feeling guilty and having problems may also be outcomes of lying, being fired is the most likely fate for a lying employee. The other options are not as directly related to the consequences of lying in the workplace.
have brain | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the ability to cogitate (or think deeply and reflectively) is a sign of having a brain or being intelligent. The other options (obsessive compulsive, mad, perambulate, sit quietly) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not fit with the idea of thinking deeply.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence mentions finding a bible placed by the gideons in the night table drawer, which is a common practice in hotels. The other options, such as hallway, homes, furniture store, and holding alarm clock, do not have any connection to the context and do not suggest someone would find a bible placed by the gideons.
dance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to add some excitement to their daily routine, which can be achieved through a physical activity that is fun and engaging. Playing hockey or basketball can be exciting, but they require access to specialized equipment and locations. Going somewhere could involve a variety of activities, but it is too vague to be the correct answer. Expressing information is not an activity that would add excitement to someone's routine. Dancing, on the other hand, is a fun and engaging physical activity that can be done in a variety of settings and does not require specialized equipment. Therefore, the correct answer is dance.
english hunt | Knowledge: Fox hunting is a traditional sport in which riders on horseback follow a pack of hounds or scent dogs to track and hunt foxes. This activity is commonly referred to as an English hunt, making it the most likely choice among the options provided. Burrowing typically refers to animals, such as rabbits or badgers, and wouldn't be relevant to fox hunting. A hen house is where chickens are kept and wouldn't be associated with fox hunting. A polo game is a completely different sport that involves playing on a horse but doesn't involve hunting. A rural area, while it may be where foxes are present, does not provide an activity for a horse rider to participate in.
leg cramps | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was not properly hydrated in a humid environment, which can lead to muscle cramps, especially in the legs during physical activity like running. The other options may be possible symptoms of dehydration, but they do not specifically relate to running or the humid environment mentioned in the sentence.
deciding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is in the process of making a decision, and therefore the appropriate choice would be "deciding." The other answer choices do not relate to decision-making or the context provided in the sentence.
birth defects | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman decided to quit smoking because she had heard that it could have negative effects on her unborn child. This is a common concern among expectant mothers, as smoking has been linked to various birth defects and developmental issues. The other options (pleasure, ill-omen, bad breath, persistent cough) do not relate to the potential risks of smoking during pregnancy.
wall | Knowledge: A shelf is typically attached to a wall to provide storage space, making the answer "wall" the most appropriate in this context. The other options do not make sense as locations for a shelf. A garage is typically used for storing vehicles or tools, while a cupboard is a type of cabinet meant for storing dishes or other items. A refrigerator is an appliance that is typically used for storing food, and a corner is a space where two walls meet, making it an unlikely location for a shelf.
financial problems | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending money and making a declaration can have negative consequences for a business. Financial problems are a common result of overspending or mismanagement of funds, which can lead to difficulties in meeting financial obligations such as loans, taxes, and employee salaries. Bankruptcy and debt are also possible outcomes, but they are more extreme than mere financial problems. Losing your home and poverty are not directly related to businesses and their financial dealings.
drawer | Knowledge: The question asks about a place to store scissors that won't be needed in the near future. A drawer is a common storage option for items that are not frequently used but still need to be accessible. The other options, such as a pencil case or backpack, suggest that the scissors may be used for school or work and therefore need to be easily portable. A cabinet or desk may also be used for storage, but a drawer is more likely to provide a safe and secure place for the scissors to be kept until they are needed.
pass out | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone were to get drunk and lose control of their inhibitions, they might experience some negative consequences. The correct answer is likely something that would result from excessive alcohol consumption, and pass out is a common effect of heavy drinking. Pregnancy, forgetfulness, death, and slurred speech do not appear to be related to the context of the sentence.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific body of water, the Grand River, which is located in the state of Michigan. The other options do not provide any information about a specific location, so they can be eliminated as choices.
wonderful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that two people are reciprocating feelings of love, which is a positive emotion associated with happiness and satisfaction. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "wonderful." "Infatuation" refers to a more superficial attraction and does not imply mutual love. "Heartache" suggests pain or sadness, which is the opposite of the intended meaning. "Peace" may suggest a positive emotion, but it does not fit the context of the sentence as described.
bless you | Knowledge: Saying "bless you" after someone sneezes is a common social convention in many cultures. The origin of this custom is somewhat unclear, but there are several theories. One is that it dates back to ancient times when people believed that a sneeze could expel evil spirits from the body. Saying "bless you" was a way of protecting the person from any lingering negative effects. Another theory is that it originated during the bubonic plague in the Middle Ages, when people believed that sneezing was a symptom of imminent death. Saying "bless you" was a way to ward off the grim reaper. Regardless of its origins, the custom of saying "bless you" has persisted to this day, and is considered a polite thing to do when someone sneezes in public. The other options are not appropriate responses to a sneeze.
love | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is excited about meeting people who are very close family, which implies a strong connection and affection towards them. Love is a common emotion associated with close family relationships, and the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Anxiety would suggest a sense of nervousness or fear, being bored implies disinterest, making new friends suggests no prior relationship, and ugly is not an emotion.
wrap up | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the party is outside during winter, which implies that it may be cold. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be to "wrap up" to stay warm while enjoying the party. The other options do not provide any useful information or do not relate to the context of the sentence.
show | Knowledge: The sentence refers to a curtain closing, which is a common occurrence at the end of a theatrical or musical performance. The word "over" suggests that the show has ended and the performance is no longer ongoing. The other options, such as bridge or window, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
floors | Knowledge: Mats are typically placed on floors as a means of protecting the surface beneath them from dirt, water, or other debris. Bathrooms may have mats near the shower or bathtub, but they are not typically referred to as "mats." Kitchen mats may be used near the sink or stove, but the kitchen is not generally associated with mats. Living rooms may have area rugs, which are similar to mats but are typically larger and more decorative. Doorways may have welcome mats, but this is a specific type of mat used to greet guests, rather than a general use mat.
roof | Knowledge: A skylight is a type of window that is installed in the roof of a building, often in order to admit natural light into the space below. The wording of the question suggests that the answer should be a location, rather than a function or a type of building. While skylights can be found in many types of structures, the correct answer is the option that specifically refers to the roof. The other choices do not describe a location where a skylight would typically be located.
fall asleep | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the adults were quietly watching TV in another room, indicating that they did not want to disturb anyone. The mention of a baby likely means that the adults were hoping for the baby to fall asleep so that they could have some quiet time to themselves. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as meditating or thinking would not be typical activities for a baby, and joining the adults to watch TV would likely not be desired if the goal was for the baby to sleep.
backpack | Knowledge: The word "their" suggests that the pens belong to the student, and the most likely place for a student to keep their own pens would be in their backpack. The other options may also involve pens, but they do not necessarily imply ownership or possession by the student. For example, art class may have communal supplies, and an office may provide pens for visitors to use. "Take notes" is also not a physical location.
diverse situations | Knowledge: Humans are adaptable creatures that have the ability to adjust to different environments and situations. This suggests that the correct answer is something that humans are equipped to handle. "CO2" (carbon dioxide) is a gas that humans exhale and while important for plant life, it is not something humans are specifically adapted to handle. "Community" and "population" are social structures and not things that humans have evolutionary adaptations for. "School" is a man-made institution and not something that humans have innate adaptations for. Therefore, "diverse situations" is the best option because it suggests the ability to handle a range of different circumstances, which is something that humans are biologically capable of doing.
fatigue | Knowledge: Travelling long distances can be tiring and exhausting, often resulting in feelings of fatigue or tiredness. The other options do not match the typical experiences or emotions associated with travelling a long distance. Energetic, motion sickness, and diarrhea may be associated with certain types of travel, but not necessarily with long-distance journeys. Relocation is a possible outcome of travel, but it is not related to the emotional or physical experiences of travelling.
high tower | Knowledge: An office building may be found in a city, industrial complex or downtown area. An advertising company may also have an office building. However, high towers typically refer to tall buildings such as skyscrapers that are often associated with commercial or residential use rather than specifically for offices. Therefore, it is unlikely for an office building to be found in a high tower.
having sex | Knowledge: While love can be expressed in many ways, having sex is commonly associated with romantic relationships and is often seen as an intimate expression of love between two consenting adults. Pain and suffering, deaths, and doing stupid things do not necessarily convey love, and a high five is a more casual and platonic gesture.
being silent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in a class setting, it is best to stay quiet and pay attention. The phrase "rather than talk" implies that speaking may be distracting or disruptive in this context. The option "being silent" best reflects the intended meaning of the sentence. The other choices, such as "obesity" or "begin speaking," do not relate to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect options.
vengeance  | Knowledge: The context suggests that the act of killing is motivated by a perceived sense of justice or retribution for past wrongs. Vengeance is often associated with the idea of taking justice into one's own hands and seeking revenge against those who have wronged them or their loved ones. The other options do not accurately describe the intent or motivation behind the act of killing in this context.
laboratory | Knowledge: Instruments are commonly used in scientific experiments and research, which typically takes place in a laboratory setting. A dentist's office would use instruments for dental procedures, while a gas station would use instruments for measuring fuel levels and dispensing gasoline. A "case" is not a location where instruments would typically be used, while an operating room would use medical instruments for surgeries rather than scientific experiments. Therefore, the correct answer is laboratory.
loss of innocence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning about the world and how it works may have a negative consequence. The phrase "loss of innocence" often refers to a realization or awareness of the darker side of life, which can be a result of gaining knowledge about the world. The other choices, such as pleasure, laughter, and anger, do not match the negative connotation of the sentence. Sadness could be a possibility, but loss of innocence is a more specific and common phrase used in this context.
in a play | Knowledge: The sentence mentions being dressed in a costume and going on stage, which suggests that the person is involved in a theatrical performance. The phrase "going on stage" also indicates that the person is about to perform. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "in a play." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
toolbox | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the saw was not needed for car repair, which suggests that it may not have been a part of a typical car repair tool set. The options "tool shed" and "hardware store" do not make sense as places where the saw might not have been included during purchase. "Tool kit" and "toolbox" both seem like possible options, but the sentence specifies that the saw was not included during purchase, which fits better with the option "toolbox."
house | Knowledge: A back garden is typically associated with a private residence, such as a house, where homeowners might have a space for outdoor activities or gardening. Police stations, cities, towns, and countries are not generally associated with having a back garden.
movement | Knowledge: The question asks about what happens while someone is going somewhere, which suggests that the answer should reflect an action or process that occurs during travel. "Movement" is the most general and appropriate answer, as it can encompass any type of transportation, such as walking, driving, or flying. "Being there" and "get excited" are results of arrival and not what happens during the journey. "Having to travel" is a phrase that describes the necessity of travel, rather than what actually occurs during it. "Walk" is too specific and only applies to one mode of transportation, whereas the question is asking for a more general answer.
acquire wealth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to achieve success, and the end goal is likely related to some form of personal gain or achievement. Out of the given options, acquiring wealth is the most closely related to success. Success is often associated with financial stability, and the pursuit of wealth is a common motivation for many people seeking success. The other options, such as delicious food, self esteem, compliments, and eating dinner, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
metal | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a process called smelting that involves minerals located in the countryside, and that this process results in the creation of a specific item. The only option that is related to this context is "metal," as smelting is a process commonly used to extract metals from ores. The other options either do not have any connection to smelting or are too general to provide a clear answer.
bus | Knowledge: The question is asking about a method of transportation for humans, and the only option that fits that description is "bus." The other options are either types of buildings or a reference to the entire solar system, which is not relevant to the question.
deceptive | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are not telling the truth, which is a characteristic commonly associated with deception. Deception involves intentionally misleading others, often for personal gain or to avoid negative consequences. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
supermarket | Knowledge: Potato chips are a common snack food that are widely available in most supermarkets. Supermarkets are large grocery stores that sell a variety of food items and household products, making them the most likely place to find potato chips for sale. The other options (bar, pantry, motherboard, in retail shop) do not typically sell food products, or are not commonly associated with snack foods like potato chips.
open door | Knowledge: The question suggests that the kids are interested in going outside to check the weather, so the correct answer would involve an action that allows them to exit the house. Of the options given, only "open door" fits that description. Sitting down, counting marbles, and wondering about the weather would not help the kids determine what the weather is like outside, and becoming adults is not a practical solution for the immediate problem described in the question.
people believe | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something unexpected happened when a radio show pretended that the Earth was invaded by Martians in the 1940s. The correct answer is "people believe" because many listeners of the radio show actually thought that the broadcast was real news and panicked. The other options, such as "eat cake" or "religion," have no clear connection to the historical event described in the sentence.
relaxing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after a long, hard day of work, it is now time for the speaker to take a break and do something restful. The option "relaxing" fits this context because it implies activities that are calming and restful, such as reading, meditating, or taking a warm bath. The other options, such as "sleep" or "peeing," might also be necessary after a hard day of work, but they don't necessarily convey the idea of relaxation. "Listen to the voices in their heads" is a nonsensical option in this context, and "watch tv" is too specific and not necessarily indicative of relaxation for everyone.
outside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the giant enemy crab is too big to fit through doors, indicating that it is located inside a building or structure. The only option that is not a location is "make person sick," which is not related to the context of the sentence. Virginia and Cape Cod are specific locations that do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. Fish market could be a possibility, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside," as the crab is likely stuck outside of a building or structure due to its size.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The question is asking about a place to store leftovers after cooking. The options provided all suggest some form of cold storage, but only the refrigerator is mentioned twice, making it the most likely answer. The other options (container, freezer, fridge) may also be suitable for storing leftovers, but they are not the most commonly used terms for cold storage of food.
expensive | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wanted to make a statement about their financial success by choosing a flashy car. Flashy cars tend to be expensive and are often associated with wealth and luxury. The option "heavy" does not make sense in this context, "obesity" is not related to the sentence, "carpooler" is irrelevant, and "red" may be a color option but does not contribute to the meaning of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is located in a specific city, Cincinnati. Therefore, the correct answer would be "city." The other options may describe aspects of the location, such as a bus stop or street corner, but do not answer the specific question of where the person is located. "Ohio" is the state in which Cincinnati is located, but the question is asking for the specific location within the state. "Grade" does not have any relevance to the context of the sentence.
work | Knowledge: The sentence implies that adult Americans have a routine that involves going to a specific place outside of their home, which is likely related to their employment. The option "work" fits this description, while the other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Tent" and "foreign" are unlikely places for frequent visits, while "apartment" and "the office" are possible alternatives, but "work" is a more general and commonly used term that encompasses different kinds of work environments.
Nepal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are famous temples located in a certain region. The options "the temples were in the background," "middle east," "jerusalem," and "jewish community" do not specifically relate to any famous temples in a particular region. However, Nepal is known for its ancient temples and is a popular destination for tourists seeking to visit famous religious monuments. Therefore, the correct answer is Nepal.
hospitals | Knowledge: Waiting rooms in hospitals are commonly associated with negative emotions such as sadness and anxiety, as people often wait there to receive bad news or to visit sick loved ones. In contrast, waiting rooms in airports or marriage halls are typically associated with positive or neutral emotions, as people are usually traveling or celebrating. Clinics and doctor's offices may also be associated with negative emotions, but they are not as commonly associated with sadness as hospitals.
drawing room or music room | Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a person might keep a piano they own, suggesting that it is a personal, rather than a commercial or public, setting. A music store, concert hall, or restaurant would be unlikely places for someone to keep a personal piano. A drawing room or music room, however, are both common spaces within a home where a piano might be kept for personal use.
go outside | Knowledge: The sentence is talking about dogs wanting to play, which usually involves physical activity. It is common for dogs to go outside to play, which is the context of the question. The other options have no relevance to the topic of dogs playing.
receptionist | Knowledge: The context of the sentence is that the man is in a lobby and needs directions. Usually, a receptionist is the person who is stationed in a lobby to greet visitors and provide assistance. The other options, such as the sun, office building, business plan, or large building, do not make logical sense as people to talk to for directions in a lobby.
aggravation | Knowledge: The word "suit" suggests legal action, such as bringing a lawsuit against someone. The sentence suggests that this legal action could do something negative to a rivalry, which would be aggravated or made worse by the act of bringing a lawsuit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
spills | Knowledge: The sentence states that Billy likes his clean sheets too much, which suggests that the reason he doesn't eat breakfast in bed that often is because he is worried about spilling food and staining his sheets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
handbag | Knowledge: The sentence describes an item that women carry a lot of things in, and refers to it as a "purse". Another common name for this item is a "handbag", which is the only option that directly relates to the context of the sentence. The other options are unrelated to the concept of carrying personal items in a bag.
children suffer | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James and Holly are getting a divorce despite not liking it, which suggests that they have a reason for ending their marriage. The phrase "they needed it" suggests that the divorce may be a difficult but necessary decision to avoid a worse outcome. The option "children suffer" is the most likely choice because divorces can be hard on children and it is common for couples to try and minimize the negative impact on their children during a divorce. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
win | Knowledge: The sentence states that the person in question is competitive and likes to play games. Typically, when someone is competitive, their goal is to win the game. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence.
entertainment | Knowledge: The word "most" suggests that the goal of the majority of people playing games is being discussed. While some people may play games for conquest or winning, most people play games for entertainment and relaxation. The other options do not have as strong a connection to the general motivation for playing games.
cold air | Knowledge: The question asks what causes steam to quickly turn into vapor, which could suggest that the steam is being cooled down. Cold air, therefore, seems like the most likely option since it would lower the temperature of the steam and cause it to rapidly condense into water vapor. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence or do not make sense in relation to the scientific properties of steam.
get married | Knowledge: Getting married is commonly associated with living with at least one other person, typically a spouse. The other options do not have any clear connection to living with other people, except for possibly having children, but having children does not necessarily mean living with other adults. Sorrow, learning and thinking are not related to living with others.
own home | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the collector is an adult, meaning they likely have their own home to store their collection. The other options (toy store, block of flats, child's bedroom) do not make sense as a place for an adult collector to keep their toys.
family room | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the bean bag chair is a shared object, and the word "everyone" suggests that it should be placed in a communal area where multiple people can use it. The options "sofa" and "floor" are not ideal choices as they suggest a single person's seating arrangement rather than a shared space. "Person's home" and "house" are too general and do not provide any specific location within the home. "Family room" is the best choice as it is a common area that is typically shared by all members of a household.
playground | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the activity of throwing a ball around is typically associated with a place where kids can play freely and safely, suggesting a playground. Streets may be too busy and pose a danger to children, while loud and gymnasium are not typically associated with ball games. A bowling alley is not specifically designed for outdoor sports, and is not a typical location for throwing a ball around.
nature preserve  | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a place where animals are protected, and the specific mention of the bald eagle suggests that it is a type of bird or animal that requires protection. A farm is not typically associated with animal protection, and soup is obviously not a place. Canada is a country and mountainous areas are not necessarily places that protect animals. A nature preserve is a specific type of protected area that has been established to protect wildlife and their habitats, making it the most appropriate answer.
Washington state | Knowledge: The description suggests that the place being referred to is known for its abundance of apple trees. Washington state is a region renowned for its apple orchards, making it the most likely choice among the options given. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
conclusion | Knowledge: In an essay, the forward is typically an introductory section that comes before the main body of the essay. Therefore, it makes sense that the section that comes after the essay would be a concluding section, commonly referred to as the conclusion. This section is used to summarize the key points of the essay and bring the discussion to a logical end. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well – last word suggests a single word rather than a section, afterword and epilogue are typically used in books rather than essays, and page numbers are irrelevant to the structure of an essay.
motorbike | Knowledge: Motorbikes typically use a chain to transfer power from the engine to the back wheel, which allows for more efficient power delivery and better acceleration compared to other options like belts or shafts. Bicycles also use chains to transfer power, but they have only two wheels and are not typically referred to as vehicles. Cars and tow trucks typically use a driveshaft to transfer power, while gear shift is not a vehicle but rather a component used in manual transmissions.
seaside town | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that living by the shore is a characteristic of a specific type of location. The correct answer is likely to be an option that is associated with living close to the ocean or sea. "Desert" is not associated with living near the shore, and "picture of sea side" is not a real location. "California" is a state that has many seaside towns, but it does not specifically refer to living by the shore. "Ocean" is not a location where people live, but rather a body of water. Therefore, the best answer is "seaside town."
get food | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah doesn't currently have food readily available for lunch, since she needs to go to her kitchen in order to eat. Therefore, the correct answer would be "get food", since Sarah needs to grab or prepare something to eat. The option "smell" does not make sense in this context, while "have food" assumes that Sarah already has food on hand. "Hungry" is a state of being and not an action, and "buy food" is not mentioned as an option for Sarah in this particular sentence.
floor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a stack of cubes, which indicates that the cubes are stacked on top of each other. The base of the stack would be the bottom of the tower, which would be in contact with the surface or floor that the stack is resting on. The other options do not make sense in the context of a stack of cubes.
summer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weathers being referred to are pleasant and comfortable, which are often associated with summertime. Sunshine and warmth are also common characteristics of the summer season. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
abandoned houses | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob the mouse lived in an area with many other mice or potentially humans, indicating a more urban or developed area. Abandoned houses are often found in such areas and may provide shelter for rodents like mice. The other choices, such as a corn field or desktop, do not seem like viable options for shelter in a densely populated area.
making new friends | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the party will take place in an alley, which is not a traditional party location. It's likely that the party will be more informal, with a smaller group of people who know each other or are open to meeting new people. Therefore, "making new friends" is the best answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some may even be considered illegal or unsafe, such as "doing drugs" or "call the police."
palace | Knowledge: Pleasure gardens were often associated with palaces and wealthy aristocrats in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. These gardens were designed to be aesthetically pleasing and provide a place for leisure activities such as strolling, picnicking, and socializing. The other options do not have a historical association with pleasure gardens.
benefit | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not think the cost of buying the new screen was worth it. The word "outweighed" implies that there was some sort of negative consequence or disadvantage to buying the screen. Since the other options do not fit this context, the correct answer is likely "benefit," as James did not see enough advantages or benefits to justify the cost.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the food being referred to is prepared on a grill, which is a common cooking method at restaurants. The other options, such as backyard or neighbor's house, do not make sense in this context as they are not usually associated with commercial food preparation. Barbeque or back yard are similar to restaurant, but the word "restaurant" is the most appropriate choice as it implies a professional setting where food is prepared and served to customers.
feel pleasure | Knowledge: The description of the animals suggests that they were enjoying themselves by eating and taking a mud bath in the sun. Feeling pleasure is a logical consequence of enjoying a relaxing activity such as this. None of the other options are likely outcomes based on the information given in the sentence.
building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are lights installed for safety purposes in a certain location during a performance. Out of the choices given, a building is the most likely location where lights would be installed for safety purposes during a performance, such as in the case of emergency exits or to guide people to a safe location during a fire drill. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence's context.
present an argument | Knowledge: Presenting an argument in a clear and organized manner can help ensure that the spectators understand the lawyer's side of the case and are anticipating future actions within the correct frame of reference. While stating the case and producing evidence can also play a role in this, presenting a well-constructed argument is key to convincing others of one's position. Charging a fee for service and coming early are not relevant to the context of the question.
peace | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that understanding each other better would have a positive impact, and specifically mentions peace as a potential outcome. Increased knowledge and ideas are not directly mentioned as outcomes, but may be indirectly related to the goal of understanding better. Schizophrenia is not related to the context of the sentence.
stress | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using a computer can be challenging for older people, which can cause additional stress when trying to complete even simple tasks. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bathroom | Knowledge: The bathroom is generally where people keep personal items such as razors, toothbrushes, and toiletries. It is a common place to find an electric razor, especially for those who regularly shave. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
seattle | Knowledge: The fact that she kept an umbrella handy for "frequent rain" suggests that she likely lived in a place where it rains frequently, such as Seattle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
boardroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the meeting was held by a committee, which is likely a group of people who have a specific purpose, such as making decisions or planning events. The fact that John ran to be a part of this committee indicates that it is likely a formal or official group, which suggests that the meeting may have been held in a professional setting, such as a boardroom in an office building. The other options do not fit as well with the idea of a formal meeting held by a committee.
ballpark | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the peanuts were being sold at a specific location during a specific time period. The most likely location for this to occur is at a ballpark during a baseball game, as it is a common snack to be sold at these events. The other options, such as a carnival or grocery store, may also sell peanuts, but they do not fit the specific context of the sentence.
kitchen floor | Knowledge: Linoleum is a type of durable flooring material that is commonly used in kitchens because it is easy to clean and maintain. It is also popular in areas that experience a lot of foot traffic, such as hallways and entryways. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
demand justice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who believe wrongdoing has occurred in government will react in a certain way. The phrase "demand justice" is an action that can be taken in response to perceived wrongdoing. The other options, such as "cook food" and "share food," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not convey a sense of reaction or response to perceived wrongdoing. The option "talk to each other" could be a possible response, but it is too general and does not specifically address the issue of perceived wrongdoing in government.
going to jail | Knowledge: The question is asking for the outcome that does not usually result from killing people, which suggests that killing people is typically associated with negative consequences. The option "going to jail" is commonly associated with committing a crime such as murder, so it is the most appropriate answer. The other options suggest positive emotions or outcomes which are unlikely to result from taking someone's life.
getting fat | Knowledge: Hamburgers are typically high in calories, fat, and sodium, which can lead to weight gain if consumed in excess. This is supported by research that shows a link between fast food consumption and obesity. The option "get full" is not specific enough as one can get full from various other foods as well. "Make money" and "choking" do not make logical sense in this context. "Hungry" is unlikely as hamburgers contain protein, which can make one feel full for longer.
used car lot | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the salesman was untrustworthy, which is a common stereotype associated with used car salesmen. A "weasel" is also often used to describe someone who is sneaky or deceitful, which further supports the idea of a used car salesman. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
house | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Bob has a bedroom on the second floor, which is a common feature of houses but not necessarily other types of buildings. Offices and schools typically have multiple floors with multiple rooms, while hotels usually have rooms on multiple floors but not specifically assigned to an individual guest like a bedroom in a house. The repetition of "hotel" as a choice is likely a mistake and can be eliminated as a valid option.
ocean | Knowledge: The term "vessel" suggests that we are talking about a boat or ship. Since the inspector labeled it as water-tight, it is safe to assume that it is meant for travel on water. The choices "sky," "human body," and "streets" are not logical next destinations for a boat. The option "port" could be a possible destination, but it is not as specific as "ocean," which is where the majority of boats travel to.
animals  | Knowledge: The question asks for other species that have blood besides humans, which implies that humans are one of the species that have blood. Vampires and soccer games are not species and therefore cannot have blood. Capillaries are a part of the circulatory system and not a species. Animals, however, are a diverse group of living organisms that all have blood as part of their anatomy.
becoming tired | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has been celebrating for hours, which suggests that they may have expended a lot of energy during that time. Additionally, the word "experiences" implies that the person is feeling a certain sensation or emotion, which would rule out options like nirvana and drinking. Hangovers are typically associated with consuming alcohol, which may or may not have occurred during the celebration, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine whether this is a likely outcome. Being happy is a possibility, but the sentence specifically asks about a physical sensation, not an emotional one. Therefore, becoming tired is the most likely answer.
music room | Knowledge: A piano is a musical instrument and is most commonly kept in a room dedicated to music or music-making, such as a music room. A concert hall or church may also have a piano, but these settings are not where someone would typically keep their own personal piano. A restaurant or drawing room would not be appropriate places to keep a piano.
synagogue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the artist created a wood carving for a place that had some sort of spiritual significance to them. A synagogue is a religious institution that would likely be associated with spiritual experiences, while the other options do not have any clear connection to spirituality or wood carvings. Additionally, a lumberyard and street would not be appropriate places to create a wood carving for installation.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the hot dog cart owner was successful in selling his hot dogs where people were active. Sporting events are often associated with physical activity and are a popular place for people to grab a quick snack like a hot dog. While other options like Disneyland and parks are also popular places for setting up a food cart, they may not necessarily attract as many active people as a sporting event would.
international space station | Knowledge: The question is asking about where humans go in space, suggesting that the correct answer will involve space travel. The only option that relates to space travel is the International Space Station, which is a habitable satellite where astronauts live and work while conducting scientific experiments in space. The other options are not related to space travel or exploration in any way.
Kansas | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about which state Pat Roberts is a senator for. Therefore, the correct answer must be a state. The term "demopublican" is not a state and the other options, while all states, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence except for Kansas, which is the state where Pat Roberts is a senator for.
go hiking | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people had a plan that could be altered by watching the morning news. Out of the options given, only "go hiking" is a plan that could be affected by the news. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
classroom | Knowledge: Pencils are commonly used in a classroom setting for writing and taking notes. Likewise, young people are often found in schools and classrooms as they attend classes and receive an education. While pencils and young people could potentially be found in other places such as a store or backpack, the most likely location based on the context of the question is a classroom. Bowling alleys, on the other hand, are unlikely to have either pencils or a high concentration of young people.
sears | Knowledge: Sears is a well-known department store that often carries hardware and home improvement items. Washington, Oregon, and Canada are geographic locations and do not provide any information about where to find a hardware store. "Small town" is too vague and does not give any specific information about where to find a hardware store.
dance | Knowledge: The sentence implies that when people experience excitement, they engage in a certain activity. Dancing is a common activity associated with excitement, as it allows people to move their bodies and release energy in a fun and expressive way. The other options do not have a strong association with excitement.
drink water | Knowledge: Dogs must drink water daily to stay healthy and hydrated. While some dogs may also be trained to shake hands or guard a house, these are not daily necessities. Mating is also not a daily requirement for dogs, and staying in place is too vague to be a correct answer.
restaurant | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the chef is skilled at cooking on a grill, and people come from far and wide to enjoy this. The context of the sentence implies that the chef works in a restaurant setting where patrons come to eat. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not typically associated with grilling food or attracting large crowds of people who enjoy grilled food.
pencil box | Knowledge: Since the question mentions an eraser, it implies that people use it to erase something they have written or drawn. The options "rain forest," "office supply store," and "schools" do not have any clear relevance to erasing or writing, while "desk drawer" could be a possibility but is too broad. A "pencil box" is a common storage container for writing utensils, including pencils with erasers, making it the most likely choice for where people might use an eraser.
nutrient | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question did not realize that consuming too much of a supposedly "good" thing could actually be harmful. This suggests that the word used to describe the substance in question should connote health or wellness. Both "nutrient" and "vitamin" are commonly associated with a healthy diet, and either could be considered "essential" in certain contexts. "Antidote" and "medicine" both suggest a substance that is taken to counteract a negative effect, which does not fit the context of the sentence. "Consumable" is a broad term and does not provide enough specificity to determine whether it is a correct answer.
shrinkage | Knowledge: When cotton clothing gets wet, it tends to shrink due to the natural properties of the fabric. This is because cotton fibers contract when they come into contact with water, causing the clothing to become smaller in size. The other options do not accurately reflect the common consequences of getting cotton clothing wet - shiver and getting cold may be associated with being wet, but they do not relate to the material itself, while not drying and mildew are outcomes of leaving wet cotton clothing for a long time, rather than a direct result of getting it wet.
america | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the rural general store is a characteristic feature of a nation. The options "towns" and "small town" are too broad and not specific enough to identify a particular nation. "Salt" is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Canada is not referred to as "the great nation" in common parlance, while America is often referred to as such. Therefore, "America" is the correct answer.
cartoon | Knowledge: The question is asking about where a nonexistent jellyfish could be found, which suggests that it is not a real animal. The option "cartoon" is the most likely answer because cartoons often feature imaginary creatures and is a medium for fictional characters. The other options refer to real locations where jellyfish could be found, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
fold | Knowledge: When the washing cycle is complete, the clothes would typically be wet and in need of being dried. However, the question asks specifically about a second tumbling machine, which suggests that the first machine was a dryer. The purpose of the second machine would then likely be for folding the dried clothes, as opposed to causing them to get wet or torn, or wearing them out.
body | Knowledge: The dressing room is a space typically used for trying on clothing before making a purchase. Therefore, it makes sense that someone would use this space to evaluate their own body in relation to the clothing they are trying on. The other options don't necessarily have a clear connection to the purpose of a dressing room.
office building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was able to easily access a deli for lunch, which indicates that the deli was located nearby. Specifically, it was located on the ground floor of a building. The options "town", "shopping center", and "strip mall" do not specify that there is a building involved, while "New York City" is too broad and does not provide enough information to determine where the deli was located. Therefore, "office building" is the most fitting choice.
person | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man believes that clothing is only intended for humans, which implies that he thinks it is inappropriate or unnecessary for a dog to be dressed up. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not have any clear connection to the idea of dressing up or the intended use of clothing.
jar | Knowledge: Coins are commonly saved in a jar or container at home, as it is a practical and convenient way to store loose change. A junk drawer or desk may also contain loose change, but these locations are not specifically designed for coin storage. A purse is portable and may contain coins, but it is not a designated place to store them. A water fountain is not a logical place to store coins.
have fun with | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James and his friends enjoy playing pretend together, which is typically done for the purpose of having fun. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence. Day dreaming and having an imagination may be necessary for playing pretend, but they do not necessarily explain why James and his friends like to do it. Running and being a good liar also do not seem related to the sentence.
It is impossible to determine the correct answer as the sentence does not provide enough context to infer who the man was with.
welcome change | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people voted for someone who was not part of the political establishment, or an "outsider," in order to bring about some kind of change. The choice "welcome change" is the most logical and fits with the sentiment expressed in the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context.
freeway | Knowledge: Signs that give direction while moving fast are typically seen on roads or highways where a driver needs to quickly determine which way to go. A freeway is a type of highway where drivers often need to make quick decisions based on signs, so it is the most likely answer choice. A fork in the road may have signs, but it does not necessarily involve moving fast, so it is not the best answer choice. A demonstration, jogging, and state park do not have any connection to the context of the question.
reflection | Knowledge: The sentence implies that feeling like a failure can be avoided or managed. The option "lower expectations" may provide temporary relief, but it is not a long-term solution. "Hold back" is not a helpful strategy towards achieving success. "Amount to nothing" is a negative and defeating option. "Illusion" is not a strategy at all. "Reflection," on the other hand, can help one to identify weaknesses and areas of improvement to avoid similar mistakes in the future, therefore, improving self-confidence and reducing the likelihood of feeling like a failure.
wakefulness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam had difficulty falling asleep, which is often associated with wakefulness. The other options do not accurately describe Sam's condition. "Stay awake" implies that Sam chose to remain awake, while "exhausted" suggests that Sam was tired and would naturally be able to fall asleep. "Being awake" simply restates the original problem, while "bed" is not a condition but a location where Sam attempted to sleep.
doctor's office | Knowledge: John's request for a tissue holder suggests that he is in a place where he can access one, such as a doctor's office. If he were in a car or on an airplane, he might have to search for tissues or ask someone for one. A restaurant or convenient spot may or may not have a tissue holder readily available, but a doctor's office is more likely to provide one for patients who may need it.
near | Knowledge: The sentence states that the driver had trouble judging the distance of oncoming cars, which means that he was having difficulty with objects that are close to him. Therefore, the correct answer would be "near," which indicates a short distance. Additionally, the other choices, such as "closeness" and "proximity," refer to the concept of being close, but they do not directly address the issue of distance. "Measured in meters" also does not fit the context of the sentence, as it is a unit of measurement rather than a description of how close or far something is.
garbage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the plate was unsanitary and no longer useful, which implies that it needed to be thrown away. The option "garbage" is the most appropriate choice because it is the most common and logical place to dispose of waste. The other options, such as "kitchen cupboard" or "table" do not make sense in the context of a dirty plate that needs to be discarded.
using money | Knowledge: The question asks about what someone is doing with their wallet when they are buying something, which suggests that they are using it to make a payment. The phrase "using money" is the most appropriate answer because it accurately describes the action that is taking place. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone buying something with their wallet.
helpful | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother asked her son to do his chores while she was gone and if he did so, it would be helpful. This implies that the son's help would be valuable to the mother, and that completing his chores would make things easier for her. The other options may be related to completing tasks or gaining something, but they do not specifically relate to helping the mother with her errands.
increase power | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the politician promised money in order to achieve a certain goal. In politics, money is often used as a means of gaining power or influence. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence - buying a party, settling everything, controlling people, or buying food do not make sense in relation to the promise of money made by a politician.
not give up | Knowledge: The phrase "backed the plot into a corner" suggests that the writer reached a point in their novel where they were unsure how to proceed with the story. The answer "not give up" implies that the writer should keep trying to find a solution and not abandon the project. The other answer choices do not provide any guidance related to the context of the question.
art room | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking where glue is commonly used. The options "desk drawer" and "cabinet" are too general and do not provide any indication of where glue would be used. "School" could be a possible answer, but it is still too broad. "Closed container" is a possible location to store glue, but it is not where glue is used. "Art room" is the most specific and appropriate answer, as glue is commonly used in art projects and activities.
None of the choices are correct. The correct answer is Madagascar.  | Knowledge: Lemurs are a type of primate that are endemic to the island nation of Madagascar off the eastern coast of Africa. They are not found in any of the countries listed in the choices.
marry | Knowledge: The concept of being "in love" suggests a romantic relationship, and one common outcome of such a relationship is marriage. The other options are not necessarily related to being in love, and may not represent likely actions for an adult in a romantic relationship.
underwater | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a human would need to check their oxygen levels in a specific environment. The options "space shuttle," "spacecraft," and "graveyard" are unrelated to this context. "Civilization" is too broad and doesn't specify any particular scenario where one might need to check oxygen levels. "Underwater," however, is a common scenario where humans need to monitor their oxygen levels to avoid drowning, making it the correct answer.
believed | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason for the members' death was due to their belief in something, which likely influenced their decision to drink the poison. The option "exist" does not make sense in this context, while "cat," "out of mind," and "happy" do not have any clear connection to the sentence. Therefore, the answer must be "believed."
sincere | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did something bad unintentionally and apologized afterwards, indicating a sense of regret or remorse. Therefore, the person's apology would be considered genuine and heartfelt, which is often associated with sincerity. The other options do not fit the context of a situation where a person has made a mistake and offered an apology.
aircraft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being discussed needs to be able to fly, which limits the options to things that can fly, such as aircraft. Additionally, the use of the word "skeleton" suggests that the object is a type of structure or framework, further narrowing down the options to those that typically have a skeleton-like structure, such as buildings or aircraft. However, the mention of it needing to be light suggests that buildings or ships are less likely options, as they typically require a lot of weight to provide stability. The second mention of "closet" is likely a typo and can be disregarded.
wash dishes or drop out of school | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student dislikes school and prefers to work instead. Washing dishes is a common entry-level job for students, and dropping out of school is a drastic action that some may take to pursue other options. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence.
laughter | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mandy enjoyed entertaining people and making them feel good. The word "laughter" is a common response to feeling good and enjoying oneself, especially in social situations. The other options, such as "fulfillment" or "infection," do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
write letter | Knowledge: The question is asking about a way to communicate with a friend when you are not physically in the same location. Of the choices given, the only option that directly relates to communication is "write letter." The other options are more about actions or behaviors towards a friend and do not involve communication as the main focus. By writing a letter, you are able to convey your thoughts, feelings, and updates to your friend in a more personal and direct way than other forms of distant communication.
at hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was visiting from out of town and had a place where he was staying. The most logical option for where he would leave his key would be at the hotel where he was staying. The other options, such as a bus depot or a pub, do not make sense as places where someone would leave a room key. James also wouldn't leave his key in his own home if he was staying at a hotel.
gas station | Knowledge: Gasoline is commonly found at gas stations, where it is used as fuel for vehicles. It is not typically found in drinking glasses or in water used for power mowers or boats. While refineries may process gasoline, it would not typically be found in the water there.
pantry or refrigerator | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on preserving the contents of the container, which usually implies the need for airtight or well-sealed packaging. Pantries are typically used for storing dry goods, such as flour or rice, which can spoil if exposed to air or moisture. Refrigerators are used for storing perishable food items that need to be kept at a specific temperature to prevent spoilage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the need for preserving contents with an airtight seal.
medical center | Knowledge: A medical center is a location where multiple healthcare providers are housed, including dentists. The phrase "alongside other such providers" suggests that the dentist office is located in a larger complex or building that houses other healthcare professionals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - a metropolitan city has many different types of businesses and facilities, a patient is a person seeking medical treatment rather than a location, main street is a common road name that could refer to any number of businesses, and a bathroom is obviously not a location for a dentist office.
over water | Knowledge: Building a bridge typically involves spanning a body of water or another obstacle. The option "over water" is the most reasonable choice. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the construction of a bridge.
bought at store | Knowledge: The verb "acquire" implies gaining something through a deliberate action, which rules out options like "found" or "driven around." The sentence also implies that the desired item was not already in possession, which rules out "eaten" or "chopped." Therefore, the most logical option is "bought at store," which is a common way to acquire food items.
own animal | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a preference for a specific type of pet that they own, which is their own animal. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Catch cold" and "eat food" are not related to liking pets, while "study literature" and "word sentence" do not fit the structure of the sentence.
None of the choices are correct, as the question asks where to look on another planet, not on Earth.
hear stories | Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the children gathered around a campfire, which is a common setting for storytelling. Additionally, the other options do not make as much sense in the context of a campfire. Playing with toys or playing house would require a different setting, such as a playroom or a backyard. Playing games or playing ball would also be difficult around a campfire due to safety concerns. Hearing stories is the most logical option that fits the context of the sentence.
utah | Knowledge: The sentence specifies that the person is looking for a steakhouse with a view of canyons. Utah is a state known for its vast canyons and natural beauty, making it a likely location for such a restaurant. The other options do not have a strong association with canyons or steakhouse restaurants.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James had placed his full coffee cup on a surface and that a black ring was left behind as a result. The most likely surface where this could happen is a table, which is often used for placing cups and glasses. Cupboard, coffee, trash, and desk are not likely surfaces where a coffee cup would be placed.
get higher | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the division of the company experienced a significant increase in profits, which implies that their overall margins also increased. "Get higher" is the most appropriate phrase that conveys this meaning. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not reflect an increase in profits or margins. "Multiplication" and "putting together" are vague and do not make sense in this context, while "unity" implies a merging of different entities, which is not relevant to the sentence.
lab | Knowledge: The word "automaton" suggests a machine that is capable of performing tasks automatically, which is typically associated with robotics and automation technology. The context of the sentence also implies that the engineers were testing the capabilities of the automaton, which would require a controlled environment such as a laboratory setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
deception | Knowledge: The sentence states that the illusionist used lying as part of his act, which suggests that the act involved some sort of deception. The other options are either too negative (such as betrayal of trust) or too vague (such as problems) to be the correct answer. Trickery is a possibility, but deception is a more specific and accurate word choice.
stress | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that Jim is nervous about taking on a new responsibility, which is often associated with stress. Employment and rejection are both outcomes of job applications, but they do not necessarily cause stress in and of themselves. Sadness and less sleep are also possible effects of stress, but they do not directly relate to Jim's current situation of applying for a job.
negligence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person responsible for the patient's care was not paying attention to their duties and was distracted by their cell phone. This behavior implies a lack of care or concern for the patient, which aligns with the definition of negligence. Antipathy and being mean are more related to intentional actions rather than neglectful ones. Indifference implies a lack of emotion or concern, but not necessarily negligence in caregiving. Recollect means to remember, which does not fit the context of the sentence.
airbase | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person mentioned is controlling air traffic, which suggests that they are working in an aviation-related industry. The word "airbase" specifically refers to a military facility where aircraft are stationed and operated, which makes it the correct choice. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
porch | Knowledge: A lawn chair is typically used for outdoor relaxation or recreation. Bedrooms, offices, kitchens, and cubicles are indoor spaces where a lawn chair would not be appropriate or practical. A porch, on the other hand, is an outdoor space often used for relaxing and enjoying the view. Therefore, it is the most appropriate answer.
need to rest | Knowledge: After a game, athletes need to allow their bodies to rest and recover from the physical exertion they just underwent. Resting allows the body to repair any damage caused during the game and helps to prevent injuries. Taking steroids is not recommended for athletes, as it is a form of cheating and can have negative health effects. Playing sports or engaging in other vigorous physical activity immediately after a game may also be detrimental to an athlete's recovery. Walking fast or cycling forever may not provide the necessary rest and recovery time that an athlete needs.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence implies that boredom can be remedied by engaging in an activity that is enjoyable. "Have fun" is the most straightforward and contextually appropriate choice. "Mind games" may be an option in some cases, but it doesn't fit the tone of the sentence. "Go somewhere" and "watch a film" could be ways to have fun, but they aren't as broad as "have fun" and may not apply in all situations. "Entertain" is a vague option that doesn't provide any clear direction.
ceiling | Knowledge: In the context of a building, the ceiling is the surface that is directly above the floor. The other options, such as the sky or people, are not typically found within a building and therefore do not make sense as a correct answer. The wall is adjacent to the floor, but not directly above it, and the roof is outside of the building and not connected to the floor.
family room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Debbie bought a ficus plant and doesn't want to keep it in a pot, meaning she intends to plant it somewhere else. The most likely place for her to plant it is in her home, and out of the options given, the family room is the most plausible. The window and flower garden options may also be possible, but the sentence does not provide enough information to support those answers. The park and hair salon options are unlikely, as they are not typical places to plant a tree.
office chair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item has legs, indicating that it is a piece of furniture or equipment that requires support. Out of the choices given, only a spinning wheel, grand piano, and office chair are items with legs. However, the context of the sentence suggests that the item is used for sitting or working since it is being described as having an uneven leg that affects its functionality. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the office chair, which is commonly used for sitting and can have uneven legs that affect its stability. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
mobile home | Knowledge: The description of a "cheap linoleum covering" and "boxy rooms" suggests a low-cost and modular living space, which is commonly associated with mobile homes. A mobile home typically has a functional, compact layout with simple furnishings, which matches the description in the sentence. The other options, such as a kitchen floor or furniture, are not large enough to be considered a place of residence, while owning land or living in a traditional house would not necessarily imply the characteristics mentioned in the sentence.
village | Knowledge: The phrase "only one churchyard" suggests that the location being referred to is a small, contained area, rather than a large city or country. A village is a small community, often rural or semi-rural, and may have only one churchyard. The other options, such as city or country, are less likely, as they are usually too large or too varied for there to be only one churchyard. England and Canada may have many villages, but the location being referred to is not specified as being in any particular country or region. Michigan, as a state in the USA, is also too broad a location to be the correct answer, and is not mentioned in the question.
television | Knowledge: The term "small screen" is commonly used to refer to television, as opposed to the "big screen" of movie theaters. Therefore, if an actor is said to be on the "small screen," they would be performing on television. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
surf net | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is bored and wants to read the latest news quickly. "Surf net" is the only choice that is related to accessing information quickly. "Allen key" is a tool used for furniture assembly and is not related to accessing news. "Use television" may be related to news but not necessarily a way to quickly read the latest news. "Make patchwork quilt" and "play chess" are unrelated to accessing news or solving the problem of boredom.
submarines | Knowledge: The question specifically asks about underwater transportation in the Atlantic Ocean. The use of the word "underwater" and "ocean" narrows down the options to vehicles or vessels that are capable of operating in the water. The option "submarines" is the most logical choice since it is a type of vessel designed specifically for underwater travel. The other options are not related to transportation or underwater travel in any way.
store clothes | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John emptied his closet racks into a cardboard box, suggesting that he is using the box to store something. The options "hold secret" and "store food" do not make sense given the context. "Store data" may be possible, but the specific mention of closet racks implies that it is related to clothing, making "store clothes" the most likely answer. "Hold things" is a general option that could also work, but "store clothes" is more specific and directly related to the context.
sporting event | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to a location where one can catch a ball. The options provided are all related to sports and physical activities, but only a sporting event is a place where catching a ball is a common occurrence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
farm yard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James purchased a property that included an old well that scared him. The most logical choice for the property type would be a farm yard, as it would typically include a well for watering crops or livestock. The other options, such as arctic or fairytale, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
special | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher wants each student to feel unique and valued as an individual, which can be represented by the word "special". The other options such as "specific" and "particular" don't necessarily convey the same sense of uniqueness, while "advance forces to city" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
fidgeting | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person standing in line is looking for ways to occupy their time, which is commonly associated with fidgeting or restlessness. Fidgeting is a common behavior when people are bored or anxious, and can involve things like tapping their foot or playing with their phone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
legal problems | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there will be consequences for hurting someone else, which may include legal problems. Hurting someone else can result in charges of assault or battery, which are criminal offenses that can lead to legal consequences such as fines, jail time, or probation. The other options, such as broken bones or hurt feelings, are consequences of the act of hurting someone but not necessarily the legal repercussions.
remote | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason why it was hard for the people to get local news is because they lived far away or in a remote location. The word "remote" means far from civilization or a city, which makes it difficult to acquire information about local events. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
headaches | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person is experiencing a migraine, which is a type of headache characterized by intense pain and often accompanied by other symptoms such as sensitivity to light and sound. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone searching for information while experiencing physical discomfort.
have rest | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the hikers were tired and needed a break. The phrase "have rest" suggests that they stopped to take a pause and relax for a bit, rather than sleep or take a nap which imply more prolonged periods of rest. "Sit down" could also be a possible answer, but it does not necessarily convey the idea of resting. "Go to bed" and "sleep" are too extreme and not practical in a hiking context.
subway | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a "dirty" method, which suggests a form of transportation that is located underground and enclosed. This description matches the subway, which is a common mode of transportation in large cities that runs on underground tracks and does not allow for views of the surrounding area or daylight. The other options either do not involve enclosed spaces, are not typically used for transportation in cities, or do not fit the context provided in the sentence.
controversy | Knowledge: In the context of legal proceedings, a jury is typically responsible for determining the outcome of a controversy or dispute. A jury would not be responsible for judging responsibility, as that would be determined by the judge or other legal authority. A film festival, resentment, and "go to jail" are tangential to the context of legal proceedings and are unlikely to be associated with something a jury would be judging.
apartment | Knowledge: The clue in the sentence is "small dwelling that are normally grouped together in one building." This is a description of an apartment building, where multiple individual living units (apartments) are located within one building. A school or restaurant would not typically have small dwellings within one building, and a closet or table is not a building at all.
car seats | Knowledge: The sentence implies that leather has a specific purpose in cars, which is likely related to its durability and ability to withstand wear and tear. Car seats are a common use of leather in cars because they provide a comfortable and durable surface that can withstand frequent use. The other options, such as purses or department stores, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
softness | Knowledge: The sentence implies that pewter has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other metal alloys. The word "softness" suggests that pewter is comparatively malleable and pliable compared to other metals, which is a sought-after quality for certain types of crafts and decorative objects. The other options, such as wooden or electrical circuits, are completely unrelated to metal alloys and are thus incorrect answers. Building rockets involves the use of space-grade alloys, which are much stronger and more resistant to heat and pressure than pewter or other common metal alloys.
ross tower | Knowledge: The sentence mentions the Sears tower and specifies that the hospital is located next to it. Therefore, we can assume that the hospital is located in close proximity to the Sears tower. The only option related to the Sears tower is Ross tower, a building located in Chicago, which is where the Sears tower is also located. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
winning | Knowledge: The main purpose of playing cards is often to win by having the best hand or scoring the most points. Counting cards is a strategy some people use to increase their chances of winning, but it is not the reason why most people play cards. Taking over the world and dealing are not related to the context of playing cards as a recreational activity. Remembering may be important for some games, but it is not the main reason why people play cards.
kitchen | Knowledge: The sentence describes the scent of food emanating from a pan on the stove. The word "simmering" suggests that the food is being cooked on the stove, which would be in the kitchen. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
have rest | Knowledge: The sentence states that the hikers were feeling exhausted, which suggests that they needed a break to rest and regain their energy. Sitting down on a log is a common way to take a rest while hiking, and it is not likely that they would choose to read a book or go to sleep in this context. "Run out of steam" is an idiom that means to lose energy or motivation, but it does not fit the context of the sentence as well as "have rest" does.
baltimore maryland | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a specific location known for a certain type of architecture. Brick row houses are a common feature in Baltimore, Maryland, particularly in neighborhoods such as Federal Hill, Fells Point, and Canton. The options "ghetto," "city center," and "garden" do not provide any specific information related to brick row houses, while "England" is too broad and does not provide enough context to determine a specific location known for this type of architecture.
out of doors | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a weasel is not a desirable animal to have indoors, which would imply that it is more suited to an outdoor setting. Of the options listed, "out of doors" is the only choice that specifically refers to being outdoors, while the other choices refer to specific locations that may or may not be suitable for a weasel. Therefore, "out of doors" is the most logical answer.
compassion | Knowledge: The sentence implies that despite the flood, God still showed mercy towards some individuals. This suggests that God has compassion, which means he has a deep concern and empathy for others. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence.
promise to do | Knowledge: The question is asking about the reason for someone's marriage. The phrase "promise to do" suggests that the person is getting married because they made a promise or commitment to someone, such as a partner or family member. Graduation, fear of death, gaining weight, and catching a cold have no clear relation to marriage and are unlikely reasons for someone to get married.
theatre | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the audience is attending a performance with an intermission, which is a common feature of theatre shows. Popcorn is also a popular snack in theatres, further supporting the idea that the audience is watching a play or musical. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
grow bigger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trees were well-nourished with both water and sunlight, which are two essential ingredients for healthy growth. The phrase "as a result" indicates that there was a clear outcome or consequence of this combination, and the option that best fits this context is "grow bigger." The other options may also be associated with healthy trees, but they do not directly relate to the specific conditions mentioned in the sentence.
racetrack | Knowledge: The question asks for the location where you can legally drive at the highest speed, and "racetrack" is commonly associated with high-speed performance driving. The other options do not have any clear association with high-speed driving. "Freeway" and "fast lane" are associated with high speeds, but may have legal speed limits that are lower than that of a racetrack. "Side of road" and "intersection" are not places where high-speed driving is legal or safe.
sweat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dancer has a bad smell, which is likely caused by sweating during the dance. Sweating is a common occurrence during physical activity like dancing, and it can lead to body odor if not addressed. The other choices don't offer a logical explanation for why the dancer would smell bad during the activity of dancing.
punishment | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam has been doing something that he shouldn't be doing, specifically kissing girls at school. The fact that he has to stay home for a week suggests that there is some sort of punishment being handed down, possibly by the school or his parents. The other options, such as disease or arousal, do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to Sam's behavior. Cooties and sweet are colloquialisms and not actual reasons for Sam having to stay home.
apartment  | Knowledge: The word "foyer" suggests a common entrance or lobby area, which is typically found in buildings with multiple units such as apartments or townhouses. A spacious house or mansion would not typically have a foyer with multiple mailboxes, as they would typically have individual mailboxes outside the property.
popularity | Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that this person has lots of friends, which is often an indicator of popularity. Accomplishing goals, getting laid, and receiving compliments may also contribute to popularity, but they are not directly mentioned in the sentence as factors that would indicate this person's level of social status. Being busy does not necessarily correlate with having many friends, so it can be ruled out as the correct answer.
violin case | Knowledge: A fiddle is a type of violin commonly used in bluegrass and other traditional music styles. When not in use, a fiddle should be stored in a protective case to prevent damage to the instrument. The other options do not provide any relevant information about storing a fiddle.
jar | Knowledge: The fact that the peanuts were sealed for freshness implies that they were placed in a container that can be tightly sealed, which eliminates the options of peanut shells, carnival or ballpark. The last choice suggests that the peanuts were purchased from a grocery store, which is possible, but does not provide information on where they were placed after being bought. Therefore, the most logical choice would be a jar, which is a common container used to store food items and can be sealed to maintain freshness.
being there | Knowledge: The question is asking about the result of reaching a destination, so the correct answer would be "being there." The other options do not describe the act of arriving at a location or completing a journey, so they are not relevant to the question.
should not | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a conflict between what his friend wanted him to do and what his conscience was telling him. The phrase "stopped him" implies that his conscience prevailed and he did not do what his friend wanted. The options "unnecessary" and "optional" imply that the action was not important or required, which does not fit the context of the sentence. "Will not" and "need not" imply that the action was not possible or necessary, which also does not fit the context. Therefore, "should not" is the best choice as it implies that the person felt a moral obligation not to do what his friend wanted.
bank money | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to take money out from a financial institution, which is commonly referred to as a withdrawal in banking terms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and may even be detrimental (such as robbing a bank).
work for | Knowledge: The sentence implies that people need to do something in order to obtain food, and the most common way to do so is by working for it. People often work in order to earn money and then use that money to buy food. The other options are not logical choices for obtaining food; growing your own food is a possibility, but it is not clear from the sentence whether this is an option available to everyone, and purchasing food from a specific website (webvan.com) is not relevant or realistic. Browsing and shopping are not actions that directly result in obtaining food.
get arrested | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is a murderer, which is a crime punishable by law. The correct answer would be that the police should arrest them. The other options do not make sense in this context. "Terrible" is an adjective and doesn't describe an action that should be taken. "Commended" means to praise or congratulate someone, which is not appropriate for a person who has been killing others. "Die" is not something that the police should do to the murderer, but rather a consequence of their actions. "Going to jail" is similar to "get arrested," but the latter is the immediate action that police would take, while the former is the inevitable consequence of it.
bomb | Knowledge: The sentence describes a device that has a fuse or timer, which typically relates to something that is meant to explode at a specific time or place. However, some of the other options, such as a fireworks display, could also have fuses or timers but they are not typically associated with explosiveness that is intended to cause damage or destruction. The context of the sentence strongly suggests that the correct answer is "bomb."
tropical seas  | Knowledge: Tropical seas are known for their warm waters and are often the site of tropical storms and hurricanes. The other options do not have a clear connection to warm waters and storm formation. The Arctic, for example, is known for its cold temperatures and would not be a likely place for a storm caused by warm waters. The weather report and America are too general and do not provide any specific information about the location of the storm.
brush | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to work out knots, which is commonly associated with brushing hair. Holding the handle tightly also supports the idea of brushing, as holding a brush too loosely can make it harder to work out knots. The other options, such as juggling or carrying a purse, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
getting in line | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many people waiting to order at the restaurant, implying that there is a queue or line. Therefore, the correct answer would be to get in line before placing an order. The other options do not make sense in this context.
eating | Knowledge: The act of chewing is a crucial component of the process of eating food. Chewing helps to mechanically break down food into smaller particles, making it easier for the body to digest and absorb nutrients. The other options are related to specific aspects of chewing, such as avoiding choking or having a sore mouth, but do not encompass the full activity of eating.
bowling alley | Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions "falling pins" and "a lot of noise," which suggests a scene that typically takes place in a bowling alley. Bowling alleys are known for their distinctive sound of pins being knocked down, and it's a common place for groups of people to have fun. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
new ideas | Knowledge: Learning about science involves gaining knowledge about the natural world, which can lead to discovering new ideas and theories. Scientists often use their knowledge to develop new hypotheses, conduct experiments to test them, and invent new technologies. While accidents can occur during scientific experiments, it is not a guaranteed outcome of learning about science. The inclusion of atheism in the options seems unrelated to the context of the question.
desk drawer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the highlighter is something that is owned or used by the person being addressed ("you"), and that it is not frequently used. The context of the sentence also implies that it should be stored within the office, rather than being purchased or borrowed from an external source like an office supply store or campus book store. The options "case" and "lamp" don't seem like logical places to store a highlighter, leaving "desk drawer" as the most reasonable choice.
driveway | Knowledge: A driveway is a common place to park a car near your house, as it is usually a designated space on your property specifically for parking vehicles. The other options do not match the context of the question: a scrap heap is a place where discarded materials are stored, a manual is a book of instructions, a parking garage is a multi-level building for parking cars, and a repair shop is a place where cars are fixed.
park | Knowledge: The question mentions a "nice day," which typically implies good weather and an opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities. The supermarket and funeral options are not appropriate for leisure activities, while the beach and wedding options may not be feasible or affordable for all families. A park is a common destination for families on nice days, as it provides open space for children to play and families to picnic or relax in nature.
move further into | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was standing in the middle of something and then changed his position in relation to a pit. The phrase "move further into" implies that James was moving closer or deeper into the pit. The other options suggest actions that would move James away from the pit or maintain his position, which do not fit the context of the sentence.
comfortable clothes | Knowledge: The sentence implies that after a long time away, a person can expect something practical or comforting from their significant other. Gifts and passionate kisses may be possible but are not guaranteed or mentioned in the context. "Own house" and "iPod" are completely unrelated to the sentence's context. "Comfortable clothes" may be a likely answer as they can be practical after a long trip and can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity upon arriving home.
collapse | Knowledge: Running twenty six miles is a marathon distance, which requires a lot of endurance and physical fitness. It is possible for a person to collapse from exhaustion or injury before completing the full distance. Sweating, drinking water, choking, and breathing, while important factors to consider during a marathon, are not likely to cause a person to stop before running the full distance.
more rice | Knowledge: The person enjoyed the takeout but felt there were too many vegetables, which suggests that the takeout contained rice and vegetables. Therefore, the person desired more rice to balance out the vegetables. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pockets | Knowledge: It is a commonly known fact that men usually keep their wallet in their pockets, either in their pants or jacket. The other options listed are not practical or typical places for men to keep their wallets.
pantry | Knowledge: The question is asking about where groceries might go when they are brought home and are not immediately used in the main cooking room. The term "pantry" is commonly used to refer to a small room or cupboard where food items are stored, particularly non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, and cereal. The other options do not fit the context of the question - a trunk is usually associated with transportation and not food storage, a supermarket is where groceries are purchased rather than stored, a sink is used for cleaning dishes rather than storing food, and a shelf could be anywhere in the house and does not necessarily imply food storage.
own kitchen | Knowledge: The question is asking for a container that is suitable for a potato, which is a food item commonly found in the kitchen. The other options (kitchen cabinet, pantry, flower vase, clam chowder) do not make sense as containers for a potato. A kitchen cabinet or pantry may be where potatoes are stored, but they are not containers. A flower vase is not appropriate for storing food, and clam chowder is a type of soup, not a container. Therefore, the correct answer is "own kitchen," which implies a container that is typically used in the kitchen.
study hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to pass a class in order to stay on a team. To pass a class, they need to do well on tests and complete homework assignments. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would need to study hard to achieve their goals. While taking tests and studying last minute may also be strategies that the person will use, they are not mentioned in the sentence.
low crime | Knowledge: Moving to the suburbs is often associated with a desire for a safer and more peaceful environment, which can be achieved through low crime rates. The other options do not offer logical reasons for moving to the suburbs, as making others happy or being a good lover do not relate to location choice, and acknowledgment and fun are subjective and open to interpretation.
study for subject | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is an upcoming test for which the guy needs to prepare. "Practice" and "homework" are options that may help in preparing for the test, but they are not specific enough to clarify what the guy needs to do. "School grade" is a measure of performance, not an action that the guy can take to prepare. "Ignore" is not a helpful option, so the best answer is "study for subject," which is the most logical action to take when preparing for a test.
corral | Knowledge: A heifer is a young female cow that has not yet given birth, and is typically kept for breeding purposes. In order to keep a heifer contained and under supervision, it would likely be kept in a corral or fenced area, rather than a dairy barn or cattle show. The milk option is not a place to keep a heifer, but rather a product that comes from cows. The countryside option is too general and does not provide specific information about where the heifer would be kept.
desktop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny's mouse is a computer mouse since it jumps around whenever he moves it. Desktop is the best choice as it refers to the place where a computer mouse would typically be found. The other options, such as abandoned houses or corn fields, have no clear connection to a computer mouse. Cupboard and cabinet could be potential choices, but desktop would be the most commonly used term in this context.
little bit | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the recipe originally called for a lot of salt to enhance the flavor, but the person making the dish has dietary restrictions that require them to use less salt. Using "too little" or "very little" would suggest that the dish lacks flavor, while "too much" or "too few" would not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Little bit" suggests a compromise between the need for flavor and the need for moderation in salt consumption.
sky | Knowledge: Airplanes are commonly used as a means of transportation through the sky. They are able to travel at fast speeds and cover great distances, making them an efficient way to travel long distances. The other options such as military bases, aircraft carriers, cloudy skies, and war do not necessarily explain why people would use airplanes in general.
provide comfort | Knowledge: The question is asking about the benefits of music for someone who is feeling down. "Provide comfort" is the correct answer because music has been shown to have a calming and soothing effect on individuals who are experiencing emotional distress. It can also provide a sense of support and companionship during difficult times. The other options do not address the specific question about the benefits of music for someone who is feeling down.
space shuttle | Knowledge: NASA is a space agency that launches rockets and shuttles into space. It is common practice for the agency to flood the immediate area with water during launch to help dissipate the intense heat and vibrations that occur during takeoff. This helps to protect the surrounding environment and equipment from damage. Therefore, the correct answer is space shuttle as it is the only option that is associated with launching into space. The other options, such as Disneyland, electrical circuit, washing machine, and sink, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
gulf states | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Texas has a long coastline, but it is not the longest among nearby options. Gulf states are coastal states along the Gulf of Mexico, so it is likely that the answer is referring to the length of the coastlines of Texas compared to other nearby states along the Gulf. The other options do not involve coastlines or nearby states that could be compared to Texas.
seat belts | Knowledge: The phrase "Because of safety concerns" suggests that the law that was passed was related to improving the safety of cars. Out of the options given, the only item directly related to car safety is seat belts. The other options - windows, trunks, four wheels, and diesel engines - are important components of a car but they do not impact the safety of the passengers as directly as seat belts do.
honor | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that during Japanese feudal times, leaders would punish individuals whom they believed did not have a certain quality. The options "adore," "cherish," and "admire" do not have a negative connotation associated with them, making it unlikely that they would result in punishment. However, "despise" implies a lack of respect, and "honor" is a quality that was highly valued in Japanese culture during feudal times, making it likely that this was the quality that leaders were looking for.
tavern | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although the place has a bar, they don't serve alcohol, which is a common feature of a tavern. A tavern is a place where people gather to eat, drink, and socialize, often with a focus on serving alcoholic beverages. The other options may also serve food, but they don't necessarily have a bar or the association with alcohol that a tavern does.
drink water | Knowledge: Sweating excessively during exercise can be a sign of dehydration, so the correct answer is likely to involve drinking water to address this issue. Fatigue, getting tired, and being lazy do not offer any solution to excessive sweating. Improving health is a general goal of exercise, but it is not directly related to sweating excessively.
white house | Knowledge: The phrase "highest office" refers to the most important or powerful position in a specific context. In this case, the context of the sentence suggests that the president being referred to is the one who holds the highest office in the United States. The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, and is therefore the correct answer. The other options are not relevant to the political context of the sentence.
forgetting | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for the opposite of remembering, which implies a loss or lack of memory. Among the choices, only "forgetting" matches this definition. "Answering question" and "stopping to think" are irrelevant to the question as they do not relate to memory. "Knowing" is an incorrect option since it is the opposite of "not knowing." "Closing eyes" is also irrelevant as it has no connection to memory.
garden | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the bug was valued for its role as a predator of aphids. Aphids are common pests that feed on plants in gardens, making it likely that the bug was also found in a garden setting. The other choices, like carpet, rug, meadow, and rock, do not have any clear connection to the idea of a predator of aphids.
hurt people | Knowledge: The word "accidents" implies that someone is injured or hurt in some way. The sentence suggests that cars are involved in these accidents and the focus is on who is affected by the accidents. While accidents can happen anywhere and at any time, the focus is on the people who are hurt or injured by the accidents. The options "happen anywhere" and "happen anytime" are not focused on who is affected by the accidents, while "happen to people" and "happen to kids" are redundant because accidents by definition involve people.
front yard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker is mowing the lawn in a residential area, indicated by the mention of passing cars, and the need to be careful not to hit landscaping. Therefore, the correct answer is either "front yard" or "back yard" as these are common areas of residential properties. The other options, such as "forest" or "golf course" do not fit with the context of the sentence.
market | Knowledge: The question asks where someone can go to buy cheese, which suggests that the answer is a location where food is sold. The options "pizza," "bar," and "refrigerator" do not necessarily have anything to do with food sales, while "fridge" specifically refers to a household appliance and not a store. "Market," on the other hand, is a location where food is commonly sold, including cheese.
Twenty four | Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can be combined to form something else. "Twenty four" is the only option that could possibly fit this description as it is made up of two separate numbers that can be combined to form a whole. The other options do not have any clear connection to the idea of combining or forming something new.
checkers | Knowledge: The use of the words "black and red chips" in the context of a general store suggests that the item being described is a box of checkers, as checkers are typically played with black and red pieces. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of a general store or the use of black and red chips.
bus depot | Knowledge: The question implies that homeless people are trying to move around, suggesting that they might be searching for transportation. The phrase "to try to move around" implies that they do not have a fixed location or residence. Out of the provided options, the "bus depot" is the most logical place that homeless people might frequent in search of transportation. The other options are not related to the context of the question.
own home | Knowledge: The word "personal" suggests that the ficus is something that a person would keep for themselves, rather than in a public space like a park or lobby. Additionally, ficus plants are commonly kept as houseplants, which makes "own home" the most likely answer. "Good health" does not make sense in this context, and "park" is an unlikely place to keep a personal plant.
paperwork | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lawyer is involved in handling proposals, which typically involves creating and processing legal documents. This implies that the lawyer is focused on paperwork, rather than getting work done, achieving results, or finishing up tasks. Marriage is also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
relaxation | Knowledge: Going on vacation is often associated with taking a break from work and daily responsibilities. Therefore, it is likely that a person on vacation will achieve relaxation. While a vacation may also provide pleasurable experiences or opportunities for compliments, these options are too broad and do not specifically apply to the context of vacation. Looking attractive is not necessarily a goal of vacation and may not even be relevant to some people.
artificial | Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the small park with the city, suggesting that the city is seen as being the opposite of natural. It describes the city as feeling "so" something, which implies a negative connotation. The options "city" and "man made" both describe the urban environment but do not directly address the negative feeling. "Very hard" might be interpreted as a possible answer, but it does not fit as well with the contrast between the park and the city as "artificial" does. "Indoors" is not relevant to the sentence, since it describes a location rather than a feeling.
yawn | Knowledge: Yawning is a common and natural reflex that occurs when our body is tired, bored, or not getting enough oxygen. It is often associated with waking up, especially if you are not fully alert or ready to start your day. While stretching and coughing may also occur when waking up, they are not as closely associated with the specific scenario described in the question. Having fun is not something typically associated with this scenario, and sneezing is unlikely to occur without a specific trigger such as allergies or illness.
simplicity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person prefers a simple life over a hectic one. This can be inferred from the contrasting terms "hectic mess" and "simplicity." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rug | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the object being referred to is being used to cover the floor and that people can walk on it. A rug is a common household item used for this exact purpose, whereas the other options, such as a front door or jail, do not make sense in this context. A towel is also used to cover a surface, but it is typically used for personal hygiene purposes, not as a floor covering.
hoarse voice | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is unable to sing today, implying that there is a physical reason why he is having difficulty. The option of having a hoarse voice fits this description, as it would make it difficult or impossible to sing properly. The other options do not offer any clear physical explanation for John's inability to sing.
dentist | Knowledge: Emergency dental services are typically provided by dentists or specialized dental offices that are equipped to handle urgent dental issues. Hospitals do have emergency departments, but they may not necessarily have dental services available. Michigan and Minnesota are states and do not refer to a specific location where emergency dental services can be found. An office building could potentially house a dental office, but it is not specific enough to guarantee emergency dental services. Therefore, the correct answer is dentist.
department store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John is in a large retail location that sells a variety of products, since there are both children's clothes and televisions in sight. A department store is a type of retail store that typically sells a wide range of products, including clothing, electronics, household items, and more. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as a drugstore primarily sells pharmaceuticals and beauty products, a garage is for automotive repair, a church is a religious facility, and a grocery store primarily sells food and household items.
louisiana | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing a fox in a southern delta state is common, and therefore, the correct answer is likely a state located in or near the southern delta region. Tennessee and South Carolina are not typically associated with the southern delta, while "hen house" and "wildlife" are not states but rather general descriptions. Louisiana, on the other hand, is a state located in the southern delta region and is therefore the most likely correct answer.
market | Knowledge: The word "procure" implies obtaining or acquiring something, usually by purchasing it or getting it through some means. Magazines are commonly sold in markets, along with other items such as groceries, household supplies, and other retail products. Libraries typically do not sell items, and doctors and electrical circuits would not be places to purchase magazines or retail products. "Table" is an object rather than a location, and does not make sense as a place to procure items.
feeling satisfied | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person experienced some form of positive emotion after completing housework. The word "desired results" implies that the person achieved their goals, which likely made them feel satisfied with their work. The other options do not fit the context of housework and desired results, making feeling satisfied the most appropriate answer.
cup | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a common container that someone would use to get themselves a drink. "Bucket" and "backpack" are not commonly used to get drinks, and "getting drunk" is not a container or means of getting a drink. "Cabinet" may contain drinks, but it is not a container someone would use to physically get a drink. "Cup" is the only logical choice as it is a common vessel for holding and drinking liquid.
dying | Knowledge: Committing murder involves taking another person's life, so the most logical outcome for the victim would be that they are dying or already dead. The other options do not directly relate to the act of committing murder or its consequences. "Sad" and "regret" imply emotional states, while "fear" describes a feeling that the victim may experience before or during the act of murder rather than its actual outcome. "Killing" is the action being taken, not the result for the victim.
city | Knowledge: Skyscrapers are tall buildings typically found in urban areas or cities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of seeing skyscrapers outside a hotel room window.
wanting more | Knowledge: The phrase "getting only a small taste" suggests that the person did not get enough of something to fully satisfy themselves. The phrase "wanting more" implies that the person desires more of what they were tasting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Canada | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a mountain is being hiked northward, which would lead an American to reach Canada. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Switzerland and Austria are located in Europe, and Orlando is a city in the southern United States, which is not north of any mountain range. "Surface of earth" is too general and doesn't give a specific destination.
go crazy | Knowledge: In this context, the sentence suggests that meeting an idol would evoke a strong emotional response in their fans. "Go crazy" implies excitement, frenzy, and perhaps even a loss of control, which is a common reaction people have when meeting their favorite celebrities. The other choices do not relate to the emotional response of meeting one's idol.
hug | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker comforted a friend by giving them something physical. The options "friendly" and "sympathetic" are adjectives that do not imply a physical action. "Handshake" is a physical action, but not typically associated with providing comfort. "Cook" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence. "Hug" is a physical action commonly associated with providing comfort and support, making it the most appropriate answer.
sea | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a quest for treasure and implies that there are multiple objects being sold. The word "isle" indicates that the treasure may be found on an island, which is typically located in a body of water such as a sea, ocean or river. "Auditorium" has no connection to the context of the sentence and is therefore an unlikely answer.
telescope | Knowledge: The question is asking about a device used to see distant stars and planets, which is a clear indication that the answer will involve something related to astronomy. A telescope is an instrument that uses lenses or mirrors to magnify and focus light from distant objects, making them appear larger and clearer. Cameras are used for recording still or moving images, glasses are used to correct vision problems, microscopes are used to magnify tiny objects, and kaleidoscopes are toys that produce colorful patterns. None of these options are related to astronomy, so they can be ruled out as incorrect answers.
store | Knowledge: The question is asking for a physical location where more candy can be obtained. While some candy may be available to purchase online or in a supermarket, the most likely option is a store, which is a more general term for a physical retail location. Box and shop are less likely options as they do not necessarily imply the availability of candy.
mail box | Knowledge: A phone bill is a document that is typically sent by mail to a customer's physical address. The mail box is where mail is typically delivered, so it is the most likely option for where a phone bill would be found. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
capital punishment | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a severe consequence for stabbing someone to death in Texas, which is likely to involve legal action. Capital punishment (the death penalty) is a possible sentence in Texas for murder or certain other crimes, including stabbing someone to death. Imprisonment is also a possible sentence, but the question specifies that the consequence is likely to involve a more severe penalty. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
play poker  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking to make quick money, which is often associated with gambling. Poker is a popular card game that involves betting and can potentially yield significant earnings with skill and luck. Dominating the world, advancing into battle, and conquering an opponent all suggest a desire for power or victory rather than a focus on making quick money. Making friends is unrelated to the context of the sentence.
care for people | Knowledge: The Bible teaches us to love one another and to treat others as we would like to be treated. This includes caring for people, showing kindness and compassion, and putting the needs of others before our own. Calling people names and speaking to them disrespectfully goes against these teachings, so those options can be eliminated. "Everywhere" and "work in life" do not make sense in the context of the question, leaving "care for people" as the most appropriate answer.
not harmed | Knowledge: The word "happy" suggests a positive feeling, so the answer must be something that is positive. "Found a penny" and "make mistakes" are not related to accidents. "Hurt people" and "harm others" are obviously negative outcomes of an accident, so they cannot be the correct answer. Therefore, the only realistic option that could lead to happiness in the aftermath of an accident is if the person involved was not harmed.
getting wet | Knowledge: An open sunroof during a rainstorm is likely to result in the driver and passengers getting wet. This is because raindrops can easily enter the car through the open sunroof. None of the other options are related to getting wet, and they do not make sense in the context of a rainstorm and an open sunroof.
conquer opponent | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned in the sentence had a strong motivation, which was fueled by his hatred, to rise through the ranks and eventually lead soldiers to achieve some goal. The options "judge" and "fight enemy" are not likely to be the end game as they seem incomplete in the context of the sentence. "Killing" is too broad and could be applied to any military action. "Advance into battle" is also incomplete and not clearly definitive. "Conquer opponent" is a logical end goal in the context of military leadership and the motivating factor of hatred.
online videos | Knowledge: The sentence is asking where it is possible to skip or fast forward through advertisements, which is a feature commonly found in online videos. Online video platforms like YouTube and Vimeo often allow users to skip ads after a certain amount of time, while traditional advertising methods like television and print media may not offer this option. Subway and mail-related options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sweating | Knowledge: Sweating is the body's natural response to regulate temperature during physical activity. As you exercise, your body produces heat and sweat to cool down, which results in water loss. Good health is not related to water loss during exercise, while pain and injuries are potential side effects of playing sports but not necessarily related to water loss. Fatigue is a possible result of dehydration caused by water loss but it is not the direct reason for it.
bank money | Knowledge: Bank money is a common way for people to acquire things they desire, as they can use it to purchase goods and services. Riots and suffering pain are not typically productive ways to acquire things, and waiting in line may be necessary in certain situations but is not a reliable way to acquire everything. Believing in god may provide emotional comfort and support, but it is not directly related to acquiring material possessions.
soap | Knowledge: When cleaning clothes in a washing machine, it is necessary to add soap in order to break down dirt and stains from the fabric. The other options are not directly related to the washing process - "take off" implies removing clothes, "sort" refers to organizing clothes by color or fabric type, "read labels" is important but not a necessary step for adding soap, and "use water" is obvious but not the only thing needed for a proper wash cycle.
clothing store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the items made of fabric are wearable, so they would likely be found in a store that sells clothing. The options "sewing room," "drawers," and "tailor shop" refer to places where clothing may be created or stored, but not necessarily sold to consumers. "Clothes store" is a less common term for a store that sells clothing, while "clothing store" is a more commonly used term.
feeling of accomplishment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had put in effort to bring his idea to life, and the sight of it working made him very happy. The phrase "beaming with" also implies a strong positive emotion. Out of the options, "feeling of accomplishment" is the most fitting as it captures the sense of achieving something after putting in hard work. Celebrate and joy are emotions, but they do not describe the specific feeling that comes with achieving something after working hard. Sadness does not make sense in the context of someone beaming with emotion, while pride is also a valid option, but feeling of accomplishment is more specific to the context of the sentence.
might fall | Knowledge: Skating involves balancing on a thin blade of metal while gliding on ice, which can be precarious and lead to falls. Fear of falling is a common fear in skating because falling can result in injury or embarrassment. The other options may also be associated with skating, but they do not specifically address the fear that the question is asking about.
zoo | Knowledge: The other options listed do not typically include an animal park among their attractions. A school is an educational institution, a carnival is a traveling amusement park, and New York City is a large urban center with many attractions, but none of these are specifically known for having an animal park. "Many places" is too vague and does not provide any helpful information. A zoo, however, specifically focuses on showcasing various animals and is a common destination for families and tourists alike.
department store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the bookshop specializes in niche or uncommon items, so someone looking for popular books may need to go to a store that carries a wider selection. Department stores typically have a larger variety of products, including books, and may cater to a broader audience than a specific bookshop. The other options, such as a student union or school, may not have a bookstore or may not have a large selection of books available to the public.
backpack | Knowledge: The question is asking for the most practical location to keep a map that is going to be used soon. Out of the given choices, only possession, suitcase, backpack, and shirt are relevant to holding items. Rest area does not have any utility in this context. A backpack is the most convenient and accessible option to carry a map around, making it the most suitable choice among the given options.
medicine cabinet | Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to store an electric razor to protect it from water, which suggests that water could damage or ruin the razor. The most logical choice is a medicine cabinet, as it is commonly located in a bathroom and provides a dry, enclosed space to store personal items. The other options do not offer the same level of protection from water damage.
cave | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characters are exploring a dark and damp environment, which is commonly associated with a cave. The mention of bats also supports this idea, as bats are often found in caves. The other options, such as batman, jungle, maze, and airport, do not fit the context of the sentence and are not associated with the description of the environment.
documentary | Knowledge: The question asks where to watch information on lizards, suggesting that the answer will be related to a source of information. The other options, such as on a cereal box or in a garden, do not seem like viable sources of information on lizards. Costa Rica and captivity may be relevant to the study of lizards, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question of where to watch information on them. A documentary, on the other hand, is a common source of educational content and would likely provide detailed information on lizards.
treetops | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the monkey never touched the ground, and the other options do not fit that criteria. Branches are connected to trees and would require the monkey to touch them, Brazil has no clear relevance to the sentence, a playful mood is not something the monkey physically interacts with, and the rain forest is a general location where the monkey may have been jumping around. Therefore, treetops is the only option left that fits the sentence's description of the monkey never leaving something.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is no longer in love with their partner, indicating that the marriage was likely causing them some degree of unhappiness or dissatisfaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ending the marriage may bring a sense of relief. The other options may also be associated with ending a marriage, but they are not as directly linked to the specific condition mentioned in the question stem.
mail clients | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the company wants to inform people about their offers, which suggests communication with clients. The options "branch out" and "own factory" are not related to communication with clients. "Call" and "pay employees" may be possible ways to communicate, but they do not specifically address letting people know about upcoming deals and offers. Therefore, the best answer is "mail clients."
river or freshwater lake | Knowledge: The question is asking about the movement of a bass, which is a type of fish. Bass are freshwater fish, so the correct answer is likely to be a freshwater environment like a river or lake. The options "guitar store", "music store", and "jazz band" are not related to the movement of fish and can be eliminated as choices.
armies | Knowledge: The sentence implies that Joe was not ready to engage in a large-scale conflict, which suggests that he did not have a military force or armies at his disposal. The other options may be important factors in preparing for war, but they do not directly relate to having an army. For example, having weapons, plans and energy are all important, but they are not necessarily sufficient on their own to wage war. Asserting power may be important in certain contexts, but it does not necessarily imply preparation for war.
clap | Knowledge: Clapping after a show is a commonly accepted form of showing appreciation and acknowledgement for the performers. It is a gesture that indicates approval, enjoyment, and gratitude. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rest | Knowledge: Going to bed is commonly associated with sleeping, which is a time for the body to rest and recover from the day's activities. Rest is often considered a necessary component of overall health and wellbeing, which may explain why it is the most likely answer in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the purpose of going to bed.
nursing home | Knowledge: Nurses who work with older people often work in nursing homes, which provide long-term care for elderly patients who require assistance with daily living activities. While nurses may also work in clinics or hospitals, these settings are not exclusively focused on caring for older patients. Parks and doctor's offices are unlikely locations for nurses to work with older people.
septic tank | Knowledge: Bacteria are microorganisms that can be harmful to humans if they spread outside their designated environment. A septic tank is a system that is designed to contain and break down human waste, which can potentially contain harmful bacteria. The other options (finger, ground, mouth, petri dish) are not typically associated with containing bacteria in this context.
open up | Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order to read a book, there is a specific action that one must take first. The answer choice "open up" directly addresses this action, indicating that you must physically open the book to begin reading it. The other choices are either unrelated or too general to specifically address the action required to read a book.
backyard | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on a small dog spending a nice day, indicating a leisurely activity. While the other options may be possible places for a small dog to spend time, the word "nice" in the sentence implies a positive, enjoyable experience. The backyard is a common place for dogs to relax, play and enjoy the outdoors, making it the most likely answer. The other options, like "basket" or "bed room," are more likely associated with sleeping or resting. "Dog show" is not a suitable answer since the sentence does not mention any activity or event.
increased knowledge | Knowledge: The question is asking for the outcome of understanding what a subject is. The most likely outcome is an increase in knowledge since understanding a subject means gaining a deeper understanding of its concepts, theories, and applications. While interest in a subject may also be a positive outcome, it is not necessarily a guaranteed outcome of understanding what a subject is. Wisdom and ideas are too vague and general to be a specific outcome of understanding a subject.
agreeable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite the difficulty of the negotiation, the two sides were able to reach a solution that worked for both parties. The word "agreeable" means pleasing or acceptable, which fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of a negotiation between two sides.
beginning | Knowledge: The phrase 'middle of a trip' implies that there is a beginning and an end to the trip. If we consider the trip to be a linear progression, then the middle would come after the beginning and before the conclusion or end. This eliminates options like left and right, which do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. First and top also do not make sense in this context, as they refer to a specific point in the trip rather than a general position in relation to the beginning and end.
panic | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny was expecting James to be on time, but when James didn't show up and time passed, Danny started to feel distressed. The clue that James is "always punctual" suggests that Danny had a reasonable expectation of James showing up on time, which makes it more likely that his absence would cause worry or panic. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or would be unlikely emotions in this situation.
punishment | Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of hurting someone without regret, which suggests that the action is morally wrong and may result in punishment. Feeling happy or resentful are unlikely outcomes for someone who intentionally harms another person, and feeling remorse may be a mitigating factor in the consequences but doesn't answer the question about what is likely to happen. Bad karma is a concept from Hinduism and Buddhism that refers to the idea that actions have consequences in future lives, but it is not a commonly accepted belief in Western cultures. Therefore, punishment is the most logical answer based on the context of the question.
large city | Knowledge: Large cities are often home to multiple sports teams and therefore have a higher likelihood of having multiple stadiums. College towns may have one or two stadiums, but not typically more than that. Conducting Olympic games may result in temporary stadiums being built, but not necessarily permanent ones. Greece and Rome may have historical stadiums, but the question does not specify a time period and therefore is not necessarily relevant to the current day.
disparagement | Knowledge: The sentence implies that James had a negative attitude towards Sarah, which is reflected in how he spoke to her. "Disparagement" means to speak disrespectfully or belittlingly about someone, which would fit with James not having much respect for Sarah. The other options are unlikely to describe how James spoke to Sarah based on the context of the sentence -- "contumely" means insolent language or treatment, "abhor" means to regard with disgust and hatred, "quietly" suggests a neutral tone, and "ignoring" wouldn't involve speaking to Sarah at all.
new york city or shopping center | Knowledge: The context suggests that Billy wants to open his deli in a location that experiences a lot of foot traffic. New York City is a busy urban area with high levels of pedestrian activity. Shopping centers are also known for attracting a large number of visitors, especially during peak times like weekends and holidays. The other options do not have the same level of foot traffic as New York City or a busy shopping center.
jump in the sprinkler | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about what can be done outside but not in a small room, suggesting that the answer will involve an activity that requires outdoor space. Tickling and playing with toys can be done both inside and outside, while seeing exhibits is typically done indoors. Jumping rope can be done in a small outdoor space, but it would still be possible to do it in a small room. Jumping in a sprinkler, however, requires access to a large outdoor area with a water source, making it the correct answer.
have nightmares | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a belief that eating a heavy meal before going to sleep can have negative consequences. One of the more common beliefs is that it will cause nightmares. This belief may stem from the fact that digestion can be more difficult when lying down, leading to discomfort and potentially disturbing dreams. The other options are not directly related to this belief.
United States | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that we are comparing Alaska's coast to other locations, and the only option that makes sense in this context is the United States, since Alaska is a state within the US. Denmark is a country in Europe and is not relevant to this comparison. Houses, California, and Florida are all specific regions within the US and do not make sense to compare to Alaska's coast in this way.
marsh | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Bill is in a "large marsh in Florida," which eliminates the options of forest and low lands. Louisiana is a separate state in the southeastern United States, so that option can also be eliminated. The Everglades is a famous wetlands area located in southern Florida, which makes it a potential answer, but the specificity of the sentence suggests that the correct answer is simply "marsh."
underage | Knowledge: The question is referring to a restriction on purchasing alcohol. The legal drinking age in most countries is 21 years old, so anyone younger than that would not be allowed to buy alcohol legally. The other choices, such as "banned" or "black market," do not relate to a legal restriction on buying alcohol but rather to other types of prohibitions or illicit sales. "Adult" and "rules" are too generic and do not provide enough context to determine the correct answer.
apartment | Knowledge: The question suggests that a ficus needs protection from the rain, indicating that it is a plant that may not thrive in wet conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to choose a location where the ficus can be shielded from the rain. Among the options, an apartment provides shelter from the rain because it is an indoor space. In contrast, the other choices do not offer sufficient protection, as an arboretum is an open garden, the ground is exposed to the elements, California is a state with varied weather conditions, and home could refer to an outdoor or indoor location.
animals | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a vet, which suggests that the blood is likely coming from animals. Additionally, the sentence implies that the vet's concern is related to the amount of blood they saw, which makes sense if they were working with animals experiencing a significant injury or health issue. A hospital or battlefield may also have blood, but in those contexts, it would not necessarily be unusual or alarming to see large amounts. A soccer game is highly unlikely to produce significant amounts of blood.
tire wear | Knowledge: The sentence implies that after driving for a long time, something happens to the car. "Wheels turning" and "transportation" are too general and do not provide enough context or specificity to be the correct answer. "Lack of fuel" and "low on gas" are specific to running out of fuel, which is not necessarily implied in the sentence. "Tire wear" is the most likely answer as driving for a long time can cause the tires to wear down, especially if the driver is not regularly checking the tire pressure or alignment.
toy store | Knowledge: A chess set is typically sold as a game or toy, not found in typical household areas like the kitchen or cupboard. A toy store would be the most appropriate place to purchase a new chess set. Michigan and dorm are unlikely choices as they don't provide any indication of where one can purchase a chess set.
sing | Knowledge: The word "express" suggests that the answer choice should involve an action that conveys emotions or feelings. Singing is a common way for children (and people in general) to express happiness or joy. Playing games could also be an answer, but it is a more general activity that could be done for many reasons beyond just expressing happiness. Starting a fight, fiddling, and spreading do not have any connection to the context of the question.
tugboat | Knowledge: The sentence specifically mentions "shipping barges" which suggests that the answer will involve a type of vessel used for towing or pulling these barges. Tugboats are specifically designed for this purpose and are commonly used in harbors and other bodies of water to assist in maneuvering larger vessels. The other options may have steering controls, but they are not primarily built for towing or pulling shipping barges.
grocery store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker needs to purchase multiple items, including snacks, a cake, and a balloon. A grocery store is the most likely option to have all of these items available in one place. The other options are not suitable for purchasing all of these items at once - a fair might have a balloon stand, but not snacks and a cake; a child's hand cannot provide these items; the sky obviously cannot provide any of these items; and a birthday party might have these items, but it is not a location the speaker can go to.
sleep and/or forgetfulness | Knowledge: The context suggests that the person was consuming alcohol the night before, which can cause them to feel drowsy and sleepy the next morning. Additionally, excessive alcohol consumption can impair memory and cause forgetfulness. The other options, such as death or slurred speech, are not necessarily a guaranteed outcome of drinking alcohol and may not be related to the context provided in the question.
being imprisoned | Knowledge: The question suggests that taking part in a killing has a negative consequence that occurs externally, meaning it is something that happens outside of the person's own emotions or physical body. While death might seem like an obvious answer, it is not an external consequence since it happens to the person themselves. Likewise, feeling guilty is an internal consequence. Blood and bloody mess are not consequences of taking part in a killing, but rather part of the act itself. Therefore, being imprisoned is the most likely answer, as it is a common legal consequence for those who take part in killings.
hockey game | Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is about a sport that Canadian players are known for. Hockey is a popular and widely played sport in Canada, and Canadian players are often considered some of the best in the world. Puck hitting is another term for playing hockey, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is hockey game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
warm place | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the snake was looking for a warm place to cozy up in order to get rid of the coldness. The options "wooded area" and "tropical forest" do not have any relation to the context of the sentence, while "blanket" and "sleeping bag" are objects that the snake cannot use. Hence, the most reasonable option is "warm place."
close eyes | Knowledge: This answer can be inferred from common experience and observation. When people sneeze, it is common for them to also close their eyes, often as a reflex or a natural response to the force of the sneeze. The other options do not have a clear connection to sneezing.
read music | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people in question have a skill for playing the violin but cannot learn others' musical pieces. This suggests that they may have difficulty reading sheet music, which is a common way to learn how to play specific songs. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
race against time  | Knowledge: The person is looking frantically at the clock, which suggests that they are running out of time to complete a task, in this case, finishing a test. The phrase "race against time" means to try to complete a task before a deadline or before time runs out, which fits the context of the sentence. The other choices do not have any connection to the concept of running out of time or feeling the pressure to finish a task quickly.
jail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting in a fight after getting drunk can result in legal consequences, such as being arrested and ending up in jail. The other options are unlikely outcomes as they do not involve legal consequences.
startled | Knowledge: The word "unexpectedly" suggests that the scientist was caught off guard by the truth. The word "startled" means to be surprised or shocked suddenly, which fits the context of the sentence. "Denial" and "relief" are emotions that may occur after processing the truth, but they do not fit the immediate reaction of the scientist. "Wars" does not make sense in this context as it is not an emotion or a reaction to discovering the truth. "Understanding" may be a possible outcome of discovering the truth, but it does not fit the context of the sentence which suggests a sudden reaction.
feel lonely | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lack of contact with others leads to a particular emotion. Lonely is a common feeling when people are isolated from others. The options "togetherness," "feed themselves," "compete with each other," and "talk to each other" do not address the question of what emotion people might experience when they have no contact with others.
being supported on chair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John has a specific fear related to sitting down, which may involve the feeling of being supported by a chair. This fear could be related to a past experience where he felt trapped or vulnerable while sitting down, or it could be related to a general anxiety related to feeling out of control. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
suicide | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person's boredom with life has led them to contemplate a drastic action, such as taking their own life. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
sewing | Knowledge: Needlepoint is a form of sewing that involves stitching thread onto a canvas to create a decorative design. Therefore, the goal competency in this context would be sewing. The other options do not relate to needlepoint or the act of stitching with a needle and thread.
see work | Knowledge: The job of a construction foreman is to supervise others, which implies that they need to be constantly monitoring the work being done by others. Therefore, it's likely that their eyes would be focused on "seeing work" all day, rather than doing any of the other activities described in the answer choices. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with the work of a construction foreman.
might drive car | Knowledge: The question is asking for a method of transportation, and the option "might drive car" is a realistic and common way for a person to get from one place to another. "Stumbling down" and "dying" are not appropriate answers because they do not relate to transportation. "Flying" may be a possible answer, but it is less common and practical compared to driving a car. "Get somewhere" is too general and does not provide any information on how the person would get there.
toy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a super ball is something that children enjoy, and it can also bounce. This description aligns with a toy that is specifically designed for play and entertainment, which is why "toy" is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately describe what a super ball is or how it is used. In addition, "earball" is not a commonly used word, which further indicates that it is not the correct answer.
body of water | Knowledge: The sentence implies that an island is surrounded by something, and the most logical option is a body of water. Hawaii is a specific location, and not all islands are located in Hawaii, so it cannot be the correct answer. Niagara Falls and Mississippi River are not related to islands or bodies of water, making them irrelevant choices. The Pacific Ocean is a larger body of water, but not all islands are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, so it is not the best answer.
mess | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the toddler's attempt at eating breakfast in bed did not go as planned, resulting in some kind of negative outcome. The word "mess" is the most likely choice, as it suggests that the toddler made a mess by spilling food and/or drinks on the bed. The other options (excluding indigestion, which is another possibility) suggest more severe consequences, such as vomiting or catastrophe, which are not supported by the context of the sentence.
meet new people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to learn how to socialize, implying that he may not have a strong social network or experience meeting new people. Therefore, it is logical that he would reach out to his best friend for advice on how to build new social connections. The other options - having friends, entertainment, input, and friendship - do not directly address Billy's specific question about socializing and meeting new people.
shelf | Knowledge: Personal books are typically kept in a place where the owner can easily access them. A shelf is a common place to store personal books because it allows for easy organization and selection of books. Classrooms and libraries may also have books, but they are typically not personal books. Cabinets and desktops may be used for storage, but they are less likely to be used for personal book storage than a shelf.
going down hill | Knowledge: The phrase "sleighing ride" suggests an activity in which one rides in a sled or sleigh, typically down a snow-covered slope. The phrase "only headed one way" suggests that there is no turning or changing direction involved. The phrase "going down hill" is the only answer choice that accurately reflects the activity described and is commonly associated with sleighing. The other answer choices are not related to sleighing or do not make sense in this context.
sporting goods store | Knowledge: A ball or bat is most commonly associated with sports, and the sentence implies that the speaker is looking to purchase these items. While one could potentially find sports equipment at a sporting event or on the street, these options are less reliable and specific than going to a dedicated sporting goods store. A hole and mall are even less likely locations to find sports equipment.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The phrase "going to bed" is commonly associated with getting ready for sleep. The other choices, such as "relax" and "rest", could also be associated with going to bed, but they do not specifically address the act of falling asleep. "Dreaming of" and "making love" are not usually associated with going to bed, and therefore they are not likely to be the correct answer.
orphan | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the couple was interested in adoption. Of the given options, only "orphan" is typically associated with adoption. "Abandon" and "give away" suggest a situation where a child is given up by their birth parents, while "biological child" implies that the couple is looking to have their own child. "Homeless" is not relevant in this context.
looking pretty | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the two people are grooming themselves in order to look their best for a party. In social situations, people often want to present themselves in an attractive and positive light, which can involve grooming and dressing up. The other options, such as being late or needing to get somewhere, do not fit the context of the sentence.  Additionally, "unclean" implies that the people were already dirty, which is not mentioned in the sentence.
burn paper | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person needed something to start a fire with before they could warm themselves up by the log. Burning paper is a common method for starting a fire, especially in indoor settings. It produces a flame quickly and can help ignite other flammable materials, such as kindling or branches. The other choices may also be used to start a fire, but they do not specifically match the context of the sentence, which mentions crumpling up some material before starting the fire.
basement | Knowledge: The question implies that the location of the boxes is important to prevent potential damage from flooding. Basements are typically the lowest point in a house and can be prone to flooding during heavy rain or a natural disaster. The other options are not typically associated with flooding or are located higher up in the house, making them less vulnerable to water damage.
arrest | Knowledge: Starting a fight while intoxicated is a criminal offense and can result in arrest. The other options, such as drunkenness, falling down, regret, or vomiting, are not necessarily related to criminal activity and would not result in legal consequences.
Nevada | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is known for having many wedding chapels. In popular culture, Las Vegas, Nevada is known for being a destination for quick weddings, and is famous for having many wedding chapels. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Manhattan | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kids were enjoying the nightlife of a big city and specifically went to a nightclub located in the Lower East Side, which is a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City. The other options don't have anything to do with the context of the sentence.
earn money | Knowledge: The sentence implies that returning to work will have a definite outcome and earning money is the most logical result. Depression, work overload, and stress are negative outcomes that may arise from returning to work, but they are not a direct result of returning to work. Sobering is not directly related to returning to work and does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
public house | Knowledge: A public house is another term for a bar or pub where people go to drink and socialize. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. A restaurant may have a bar area, but it is not primarily known as a place to go for drinks. Michigan is a state and not a specific location to go to a bar. Hospitals and airports are not places where people typically go to drink.
hill | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a person is seeking a good view, which is often associated with having an elevated position. A hill provides a natural elevation, allowing a person to have a broader perspective of their surroundings. A building or space shuttle could also provide an elevated view, but it depends on the context of the situation. Family and water cooler do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
write code | Knowledge: To create a program, one needs to write code, which is a series of instructions that a computer can understand and execute. Thinking logically and learning programming are important steps in the process, but they alone do not create a program. Compiling is a process that converts the written code into an executable program, but again, it cannot be done without first writing the code. Getting frustrated is not a necessary step in program creation.
smile | Knowledge: Smiling is often seen as a welcoming and friendly expression, which makes it a good choice for someone trying to make friends. Handshakes are more formal and often reserved for professional settings, while simply saying "nice" or "meet new people" may not give off the same warmth and approachability as a smile. "Meet people" is too vague and does not indicate any specific action or expression.
feared the bucket | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animals' behavior was prompted by the appearance of a bucket, which implies that the bucket triggered some sort of fear or agitation in the animals. It's possible that the animals had had a negative past experience with a similar object, or that the bucket looked threatening or unfamiliar to them. The other options, such as hunger or pain, do not provide a clear explanation for why the animals would be specifically reacting to a bucket.
prison sentence | Knowledge: The sentence implies that if evidence is discovered that someone has committed murder, they will likely face a punishment that involves being confined in a specific institution for a prolonged period of time. This is typically referred to as a prison sentence. The other options may be related to the concept of punishment, but do not necessarily imply a lengthy confinement period.
dentist office | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the toothbrush was given as a gift, rather than purchased. It also mentions that the man received the toothbrush (rather than buying it) which suggests that he obtained it from a place where toothbrushes are commonly given out for free. Dentist offices commonly offer free toothbrushes to their patients as part of preventative care, making it the most likely option among the given choices. The other options (bedroom, supermarket, drug store, and grocery store) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
damage | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man's drug addiction had a negative impact on his relationships, which would likely result in damage to those relationships. The other options (cause accidents, cause illness, pain, lower i.q) do not directly relate to the impact on relationships mentioned in the sentence.
front door | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the person is locking something for safety or security reasons at night. The options "own," "gate," and "entrance" are too broad and could refer to a variety of things. The option "controlling whether door opened" does not make sense grammatically and does not fit with the context. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "front door," which is a common feature in most homes and is often locked at night for safety reasons.
office | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a desk, which is commonly associated with an office. Additionally, the character is looking at a door and waiting for work to end, which suggests that he is in a workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
downtown area or downtown district | Knowledge: Dance clubs are often located in bustling areas with a lot of foot traffic and night life. "Downtown" generally refers to the central business district of a city, which often has a lot of nightlife options including bars and clubs. "City hall" is the government building in a city and would not likely have a dance club. "Town" and "United States" are too broad and generic to be specific enough for locating a specific type of establishment.
supplies | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman was busy with her daily tasks, which suggests that she was likely gathering necessary items or supplies. This is reinforced by the fact that the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Help people" or "be helpful" would suggest that she was doing something for others, while "get dressed" would suggest that she was preparing to go somewhere. "Gain" does not make sense in this context.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: The question is asking about where to put a plate after it has been washed, which suggests that the plate is going to be used again in the future. In a household setting, it is common to put clean dishes in the kitchen cupboard to store them until they are needed again. The other options (flea market, restaurant, and outside) do not make sense in the context of everyday dish-washing at home, and the dishwasher is where the plate would be washed, not stored.
front yard | Knowledge: Apple trees require a lot of sunlight to grow and bear fruit, so planting them in a location that gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day is important. The front yard is often a good choice because it is usually the most accessible and visible location, and it also tends to receive more sunlight than other parts of the property. Planting the apple tree across the street or in a park is not a practical or viable option. Pennsylvania and countryside are not specific enough locations to determine whether they would be good places to plant an apple tree.
salt water | Knowledge: Jellyfish are aquatic creatures and require water to survive. However, not all water is suitable for them. Jellyfish are typically found in oceans and other bodies of salt water, where they can thrive. The other options, such as a store, a Japanese restaurant, and Hawaii, do not have any clear connection to the habitat requirements of jellyfish. The choice "see" is also unlikely since jellyfish generally cannot survive outside of water.
prepare | Knowledge: The question is asking what a person would do before a performance, suggesting they need to ready themselves for the upcoming show. "Accomplish" and "become actor" do not fit the context of preparing for a performance. "Attend drama classes" might help improve an actor's skills but is unlikely to be a primary activity the day before a performance. Therefore, the best answer is "prepare."
thin | Knowledge: The sentence describes the pizza crust as being broad and large in circumference, but also crispy. This suggests that the crust is not thick, but rather thin and crunchy. The other options do not accurately describe the texture or size of the crust.
dimly lit room | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of lighting a candle is done in order to see something, which implies that the environment is not well-lit. The term "dimly lit" is commonly used to refer to a space that does not have much light, hence it is the correct answer. The other options (synagogue, sunlight, birthday cake, bedroom) do not necessarily suggest a lack of light in the surrounding environment.
jewelry | Knowledge: The question implies that the item made out of wool cannot be worn, which rules out options such as clothing stores, sweaters, and clothing factories. The remaining options are fabric stores and jewelry, but it is unlikely that a fabric store would sell non-wearable wool items. Therefore, the correct answer must be jewelry. Wool can be used to make various types of jewelry, such as necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, which are not intended to be worn as clothing.
discomfort | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone discusses their marital issues with friends, it may lead to an uncomfortable situation. This is likely due to the personal nature of the topic, and the potential for gossip or unwanted advice. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotions that may arise from discussing marital issues with friends.
lake | Knowledge: A lake is a small body of water, often surrounded by land and commonly used for recreational activities such as boating. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of a boat; water and ocean are too broad, a football ground is not typically associated with boats, and a harbor is a specific location where boats dock rather than a place where boats are commonly found.
town  | Knowledge: The keyword in the question is "playgrounds," which is generally associated with public places. Among the given options, only "town" can be a place where people can take their kids to play on playgrounds because towns may have public parks and recreational areas where playgrounds are present. The other options, such as conference, apartment, wedding, and theater, do not have any clear connection to children playing or playgrounds.
apartment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the specific layout being described is commonly found in a certain type of living space. The word "dwelling" could refer to any type of housing, so it is too general. "Bed and breakfast" and "hotel" may have specific layouts for bedrooms, but they are not necessarily standard or common. A "loft" may be a unique or non-standard living space where the layout of the bedroom may vary. Therefore, the correct answer is "apartment," which typically has a standard layout where the bedroom is the only private room.
dance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between listening to music and drinking alcohol, and that people are likely to engage in a specific activity as a result. Dancing is a common activity associated with listening to music in social settings, especially when alcohol is involved. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence or do not logically follow from the information given.
full | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man was carrying something, which was later identified as wood. Additionally, the description of his arms flexing suggests that he was carrying a heavy load. Thus, the correct answer is likely "full," as this suggests that his grasp was holding the maximum amount of wood that he could carry at once. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
pocket | Knowledge: A harmonica is a small and portable instrument that can easily fit into someone's pocket. Therefore, while it could be found in a music store or used by a country or blues band, it would be unexpected to find a harmonica in a rock band or any other setting where it couldn't be easily carried around or played on the go.
get laid | Knowledge: The context of the sentence, which mentions the man spending the weekend with his girlfriend, suggests that the likely activity he engaged in is sexual relations with her. The phrase "get laid" is a slang phrase that refers to having sex, and is commonly used in this context. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence, and do not make sense in this context.
murder | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is planning to take the life of another person, which is commonly known as murder. The other options do not accurately describe the act of intentionally and unlawfully causing someone's death. "Take life" is a more general phrase, "or dies" is not a goal but rather an outcome, "feel remorse" is an emotional response rather than a goal, and "shoot" could apply to a variety of situations where killing is not the intent.
compete or cash in | Knowledge: Winning is often associated with competing, as it implies coming out on top in a contest or competition. It can also be associated with cashing in, as winning a prize or jackpot often results in a financial reward. Celebrating and bragging may be the result of winning, but they are not necessarily the direct cause of it. Fun is a subjective experience and does not necessarily lead to winning.
communication | Knowledge: The sentence is comparing two forms of expression - talking and writing - and is looking for a term that encompasses both. Communication is the broadest term that covers both talking and writing as methods of sharing information and ideas with others. Telling a story is a more specific action that can be included within the broader category of communication. Revelation is also a form of communicating information, but it is not as commonly associated with talking and writing. Listening to and conversation are not broad enough terms to encompass both talking and writing.
take trips | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is something that older people can do that young people cannot do. The option "take trips" makes sense because older people may have more free time and resources to travel, whereas young people may be busy with school or work. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as there is no mention of emotional reactions or physical changes.
empowering | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher believes that learning all you can is important because it can lead to success in various areas of life. The word "empowering" implies that gaining knowledge can give someone a sense of control or confidence in achieving their goals. The other options all relate to the concept of learning and knowledge, but do not convey the idea of empowerment that is present in the sentence.
attic | Knowledge: The word "old" suggests that John may have found the pictures in a place where items are typically stored for a long time, such as an attic. None of the other options are commonly associated with storing personal photos.
kitchen | Knowledge: Mice are known to be attracted to food and water sources, which are commonly found in kitchens. They may also be attracted to sites with warmth and shelter, such as cupboards. The other options (on the couch, Disneyland, garage) do not provide ideal living conditions for mice.
hospital | Knowledge: A blood transfusion is a medical procedure that requires specialized equipment and trained medical professionals, therefore it must be done in a hospital setting. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A gurney is a type of stretcher used to transport patients, a person refers to a human being, and arteries and veins are blood vessels within the body but are not locations where a blood transfusion would take place.
do enjoy | Knowledge: The question asks for an activity that will provide enjoyment, so the choice that best aligns with this is "do enjoy." The other options do not provide any clear suggestions for a fun activity and may be irrelevant or inappropriate in the given context.
villa | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabin that Sarah rented was unusually large and spacious for a cabin, which implies that it was more comparable to a larger, more luxurious dwelling like a villa. A palace may also be large and spacious, but it would be unlikely to be rented out like a cabin. Spacecraft, hall, and liner do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
machines | Knowledge: Ball bearings are commonly used in machinery to reduce friction and allow parts to move smoothly. Therefore, it is likely that the wall Dan found the ball bearings behind was part of a machine or mechanical system. The other answer choices - high quality motor, skatepark, church, and can - do not suggest any connection to ball bearings or machinery.
muscle | Knowledge: Muscles are responsible for movement in the body, as they contract and relax to move bones and joints. Flesh, human body vertebrates, skin and, cartilage do not have the ability to move bones. The only choice that directly relates to movement and mobility is muscle.
outside | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man lost his keys while walking in a crime-ridden area, which implies that he was outside when he lost them. The other options (except for purse) suggest places where he might typically keep his keys, but the sentence does not suggest that he left them in any of those places. Therefore, outside is the best option based on the context provided.
container | Knowledge: The question is asking for a place to put coffee if it is not needed immediately, implying that the coffee will be saved for later. A container is a logical solution for storing coffee as it helps to keep it fresh and prevents spills. A cryogenic pod and train station do not make sense in this context. A cup is only suitable if the coffee will be consumed shortly after it is made, and an internet cafe has no relevance to coffee storage.
candle | Knowledge: The sentence asks for a light source that does not require electricity, meaning that any option that relies on electricity (such as a light switch or lamp) can be eliminated. A hallway and house are not light sources, leaving only the candle as a possible correct answer. Additionally, candles have been used as a light source for thousands of years, making them a well-known and common alternative to electrically powered lights.
purse | Knowledge: Coins are typically carried around in a small personal bag or container, such as a purse, wallet, or coin purse. The other options (medium, water fountain, wishing well, desk) do not make sense as they are not typical places to store coins while on the go.
unconventional | Knowledge: The question is asking for an antonym of "normal," which can mean "usual," "typical," or "expected." "Unconventional" is a common antonym for "normal" and refers to something that is not conforming to traditional or expected norms. The other options do not necessarily indicate a deviation from normalcy in the same way, with "orthodox" possibly indicating adherence to traditional norms, "ill" indicating a medical condition, "reverse" indicating opposition or reversal, and "tangential" indicating a connection only indirectly related to the topic at hand.
roadsides | Knowledge: The sentence implies that litter is being thrown from a moving car, suggesting that it lands on the side of the road rather than on a street corner or in a park. Additionally, the phrase "not in the garbage" suggests that the litter is not being disposed of properly, making it likely to end up on the ground or roadside.
criminal trial | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that killing is a crime and will result in a legal trial. The option "criminal trial" fits the context of the sentence as it refers specifically to a legal trial for a crime. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dish | Knowledge: The question is asking how chicken would be served, and "dish" is the most appropriate choice. Chicken can be served in many types of dishes, such as roasted chicken, chicken curry, or chicken stir-fry. "Freezer" and "eaten" are not ways of serving chicken, but rather refer to how it is stored or consumed. "Plate" is too broad and could apply to any food item, and "fast food restaurant" is a specific location where chicken may be served, but does not describe the actual serving method.
easter  | Knowledge: Christmas is typically celebrated in December, and Easter usually follows as the next major holiday in the calendar year. Easter is often associated with the arrival of spring and the symbol of new beginnings, which makes it a logical answer to the question. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
summer | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the transition from warm weather to cold weather has occurred, which is a seasonal change commonly associated with summer turning into fall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
library | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shelf with toys is intended for young people who are learning, which implies an educational or intellectual setting. Among the options provided, the library is the most likely to have resources for learning and education. While the other options might also have shelves or areas for toys, they are less likely to be focused on educational resources.
think more clearly | Knowledge: Breathing fresh air can increase the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream, which can improve cognitive function and help you think more clearly. Additionally, being outside in nature and breathing fresh air can have a calming and refreshing effect on the mind and body, which may help you make better decisions. The other options do not have a clear connection to the benefits of breathing fresh air for decision-making.
feeling happy |  | Knowledge: The fact that the sentence mentions having fun with people you care about suggests that the outcome will likely be a positive emotion or feeling. The other options (better mood, smiling, feeling better, being excited) could also result from having fun with loved ones, but feeling happy is the most likely outcome as it is the most commonly associated positive emotion with social interactions.
card catalogue | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a system for organizing addresses that involves writing them on index cards and sorting them. A card catalogue is a common system used in libraries to organize information on index cards. This suggests that the person may have a similar system for organizing addresses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get free | Knowledge: The context of the sentence describes wrestling as a contest where two people try to pin each other to the ground. Therefore, if one is about to be pinned, the logical goal would be to get free and avoid losing the match. The other options are irrelevant or inappropriate in this context.
a greenhouse | Knowledge: The question is asking about a location where someone might find many varieties of ficus, which indicates that the answer is related to plant cultivation or sale. A greenhouse is a structure designed for growing plants, and is likely to have a larger variety of plants than a single pot or front yard. A conservatory is also a possible location for plant cultivation, but is less commonly used than a greenhouse. California might have a warm climate suitable for growing ficus, but it is a general location and does not specify a particular place where many varieties of ficus can be found.
university | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about higher education, which typically refers to post-secondary education beyond high school. While some of the other choices may involve education, such as classrooms or homeschooling, they do not necessarily imply a higher level of education. University, on the other hand, is a well-known institution that offers higher education in a variety of fields and is often the next step for students after completing high school.
company | Knowledge: In this context, the question is asking for a specific entity to contact for assistance with internet connection. Calling 911 would be inappropriate, as it is for emergency situations. Electrical circuit and airport have no relevance to the issue of internet connectivity. Computer network may be a possible option, but it is more likely that the person needs to contact their internet service provider, which is typically referred to as a "company" that provides internet services.
mandatory | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the manager made a decision that applies to all nonessential personnel, indicating that the leave in question is mandatory rather than optional. The word "mandatory" means "required by law or rules," which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "shall" and "required," are also suggestive of obligation, but less directly so than "mandatory." "Necessary" and "essential" do not convey the sense of obligation that the sentence implies.
coffin or graveyard | Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to a body after death. Typically, a deceased person's body is placed in a coffin and either buried in a graveyard or cremated. A zombie is a fictional character that is not related to the process of death and disposal of a body. Bodycam is a small camera worn by police officers and has no relationship to the question at hand. A funeral is a ceremony that takes place before burial or cremation, and is not indicative of what happens to the body afterward.
making love | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is actively engaged in a different activity instead of going to bed. The only option that fits this context is "making love." Insomnia, pregnancy, and rest are all activities that might interfere with going to bed, but they do not involve active engagement like making love. Additionally, an infant might prevent a couple from sleeping, but it does not necessarily prevent them from going to bed.
stop working | Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a reason why someone might not earn money while they have lunch, and the answer choice "stop working" is the most logical. When someone is working, they are typically earning money. When they stop working, they stop earning money. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question, as they are all related to eating food rather than earning money.
follow instructions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was able to use computers despite not understanding them, indicating that he was likely able to follow instructions or step-by-step processes to accomplish tasks on the computer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fulfillment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man has been entertaining for his entire life and is now in his nineties, which implies that he enjoys performing and finds fulfillment in it. The other options do not make sense in this context - suicide and embarrassment seem unlikely outcomes, fatigue may be a concern but is not the most logical choice, and laughter is a potential result of the show but does not address the question of how the man might feel about it.
being satisfied | Knowledge: Breakfast is commonly known as the first meal of the day and is often eaten to provide energy and nutrients after a prolonged period of fasting during sleep. Being satisfied is a common reason for eating breakfast, as it can help to curb hunger and provide necessary sustenance to start the day. The other options (gas, dirty dishes, get distracted, bad breath) do not provide a logical reason for eating breakfast.
free flowing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that something is not free flowing, and since the subject is thick molasses, it is safe to assume that the correct answer should have an opposite meaning to that. Thick molasses is thick, viscous, and does not flow easily, so it is not free flowing. The other options, such as sweet, unacquainted, sparse, and slender, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
inspired | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hearing someone play violin beautifully has a certain effect on the listener. The word "beautifully" implies that the music is pleasing to the ear, and the listener's emotional response is described as a feeling of being "made" or influenced in some way. The word "inspiring" conveys a sense of being moved to take action or create something oneself, which is a common reaction to experiencing beauty in art. The other options either do not fit the context or are not related to the musical instrument mentioned.
answer | Knowledge: The phrase "kept calling but to no avail" suggests that the person was expecting a response from someone they were trying to contact. The word "answer" is a synonym for response, making it the most likely option. The other choices, such as "communicate" or "attracting ducks," do not fit the context of the sentence. "Hang up" is the opposite of what the person was hoping to achieve, and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
going to jail | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that intentionally starting a fire is a serious offense that could result in legal consequences. The option "going to jail" is the most logical choice as it implies punishment for the action. The other options do not make sense in the context of intentionally starting a fire. "Warmth" and "feel cold" are about physical sensations, while "death" implies a more severe consequence than going to jail.
house | Knowledge: The question asks for a place where one could have hundreds of thousands of chess board, which suggests that the place must be large enough to accommodate a significant number of items. A house, particularly a large one or a mansion, could have enough space to store a collection of that size. Parks and YMCA facilities are typically public spaces and would not have enough room for such large collections. Germany is a country and is not a specific location that could hold a large number of chess boards. A room could potentially hold a few chess boards, but not hundreds of thousands.
desk | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person spent their workday at a computer, which suggests they have a desk job. A footstool is commonly used to provide extra comfort while sitting at a desk for extended periods of time. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they are not typically associated with desk work or sitting for long periods of time.
drawer | Knowledge: The use of the term "could have" suggests that the answer is speculative in nature. The term "paper clips" suggests that the answer is related to a small office supply item. The options "university" and "work" are too broad and do not specifically relate to paper clips. "Desktop" is also too broad and does not necessarily imply a large quantity of paper clips. "Fashioned into simple tools" is too specific and not a common use for paper clips. "Drawer" is the most likely answer as it is a common storage location for paper clips and could potentially hold tens of thousands of them.
restaurant | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John was looking for a place to drink alcohol, but he didn't know where any of the bars were. The fact that he eventually found something that wasn't a bar but still served drinks indicates that he may have found a restaurant. Many restaurants serve alcoholic beverages, and they are also commonly found in areas where bars are located. The other options, such as an airport, a specific state (Michigan), a public house, or Las Vegas do not seem as likely based on the context provided.
live life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's desire to express his love and share it with others was motivated by a feeling of being "higher" or happier. From this, we can infer that he simply wants to enjoy life to the fullest and experience joy in everything he does. Sharing naughty photos of himself would be inappropriate and unrelated to expressing love, and proposing to a woman or kissing may be specific actions related to romantic love, but do not necessarily capture the broader idea of living life to the fullest. Singing may be a form of expression, but it is not necessarily tied to living life in general.
eyrie | Knowledge: An eyrie is the nest of a bird of prey, and it is typically placed in a high location that provides a panoramic view of the surrounding area. Bald eagles are known for building their nests in trees that are located on top of tall cliffs or in other similarly high locations. Because of the lofty location of an eyrie, a bald eagle could indeed see for miles around. The other options are not likely locations for an eagle's nest, and they do not specifically relate to the question's context.
emotional distress | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the couple is going through a divorce and is most concerned about their children. This suggests that the correct answer will relate to how the divorce could impact the children. "Bad feelings" and "two christmas's" are not clear indicators of negative consequences for the children. "Richer" and "freedom" are not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Emotional distress" is a common concern for parents going through a divorce as it can have lasting effects on the children's emotional well-being.
convention | Knowledge: Business people often attend conventions to get updates about their industry. A convention is a large gathering of people with a common interest, such as a trade or profession. At a convention, attendees typically have access to keynote speakers, workshops, exhibit halls, and networking opportunities. Schools, operas, weddings, and bus stops do not typically provide updates about industry news, making them poor choices for this question.
picks up  | Knowledge: Given the context of setting a cup on a table many times, the most likely option is that the cup picks up characteristics of the table, such as dust or dirt. The other options do not seem relevant to the context. Noise may occur if the cup is set down heavily, spillage can occur if the cup is set down unevenly or if there is liquid inside, clutter is unlikely unless cups are left on the table for an extended period of time, and the cup getting cold is also possible but not directly related to the action of setting it down on the table.
skill | Knowledge: The question suggests that winning in ball requires a certain ability or proficiency, which is commonly referred to as "skill." Skill refers to having the ability to perform a task effectively and efficiently, and is often developed through practice and training. The other options such as luck, challenge, and desire to win may play a role in the outcome of a competition, but they do not necessarily guarantee a win. An edge may refer to an advantage, but it is not clear what type of advantage is being referred to in the context of the question.
Chesapeake Bay | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the place is known for its crab, which suggests that it is a body of water or a region with a large crab population. The options "fish market," "clam chowder," "cooking pot," and "tidepools" do not fit this description, leaving "Chesapeake Bay" as the correct answer. The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary that spans across Maryland and Virginia and is known for its abundant blue crabs.
heading east | Knowledge: Going into a ship is usually associated with travel, and the direction mentioned in the option "heading east" suggests a specific destination. Ships are often used for transportation over long distances, and heading east could indicate a journey towards Asia, Europe, or Africa, which are typically located in the eastern hemisphere. The other options do not give any clear indication of why someone would go into a ship.
feeling satisfied | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person eats just enough during breakfast, which implies that they are able to recognize when they are satisfied with their meal. The option "feeling satisfied" directly aligns with this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "gas", "bloated", and "full stomach" imply discomfort rather than satisfaction, while "have energy" is not necessarily related to the amount of food eaten.
conclave  | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the word being discussed is a term used by cardinals, which indicates that it relates to a specific event or activity within the context of the Catholic Church. "Conclave" is a term used to describe the gathering of cardinals to elect a new pope, making it the most likely choice among the options. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
window | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there may be a glass barrier through which dishes can be seen, which is commonly found in windows. Windows are typically made of glass and provide a view of the outside or inside of a space. The other options, such as dishwasher or cabinet, do not typically have glass barriers through which dishes can be seen.
office | Knowledge: Typing on a keyboard is typically associated with office work, as it is a common activity done on computers for tasks such as writing emails or creating documents. The other options do not make sense in this context. A landfill would be an unlikely place to see someone typing on a keyboard, as would a music store or using a camera. "Finger" is not a location where someone would be typing but a body part used for typing.
bowl of soup | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about where to dip a spoon, indicating that the right answer must involve a container that is commonly used for eating with a spoon. The other options do not involve the use of a spoon for eating, so they can be ruled out. In addition, the phrase "bowl of soup" specifically mentions a food item that is commonly consumed using a spoon.
Democratic | Knowledge: The DRC stands for the Democratic Republic of Congo, therefore the D in DRC must stand for "Democratic". The other options do not fit with the context of the question or the known facts about the DRC.
competition | Knowledge: Wrestling is a sport where athletes compete against each other to win. Therefore, if a number of athletes are wrestling, they are likely in a competitive setting, such as a wrestling match, tournament, or competition. The other choices do not have a clear connection to wrestling or competitive sports.
street corner | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are two blocks and a mailbox located between them. A street corner is typically the location where two blocks meet, and it's a common place to find mailboxes. The other options (front door, post office, apartment complex, fence) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
think critically | Knowledge: The question is asking about how a human solves problems, which suggests a cognitive process rather than a physical one. "Think critically" is a commonly used phrase to describe the process of evaluating and analyzing information to make informed decisions or solve problems. The other options do not relate to problem-solving or critical thinking.
remember everything | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier, which implies that the elephant has a strong memory. The option "remember everything" is a logical and plausible reason for why the elephant was asked to recall the number, as it suggests that the elephant has a remarkable ability to remember things. The other options, such as "breathe" or "experience sadness," do not have any logical connection to why the elephant would be asked to recall a number.
park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing basketball would take place outdoors, which eliminates the options of gymnasium and sporting goods store. Scoring and dribbling refer to actions within playing basketball, but do not indicate a location. Park is the most likely option, as it is a common location for outdoor recreational activities, including basketball.
sell stock | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about how an investor gets cash, which suggests that the answer must relate to the buying and selling of assets. "Save money" and "from a job" are not relevant because they do not involve any kind of investment activity. "Buy stock" is not the correct answer because it involves putting money into an investment, not getting money out of it. "Gain wealth" is too vague and does not specifically address the question of how an investor gets cash. Therefore, "sell stock" is the best answer, as it is the most direct way for an investor to convert an asset into cash.
front | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John's parking space was in a favorable location. The word "front" suggests that the space was located near the entrance or main part of the building, which would make it easier for John to access. The other options, including "jar," "universe," "box," and "answer," do not make sense in the context of the sentence and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
field | Knowledge: Insects are often found in natural environments, such as fields, where they can feed on vegetation or other natural resources. The word "green" suggests that the insects are consuming some sort of plant matter, which would be most likely found in a field or other green areas. The other options, such as air, rock, or Arctic, do not provide any obvious sources of green matter for insects to eat. A log may have some moss or algae growing on it that insects could feed on, but it is less likely than a field.
hotel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was unable to find an affordable place to stay, so he decided to splurge on a fancy and upscale option. The most likely option would be a hotel, as hotels are known for offering luxurious and expensive accommodations. The other choices, such as a city or Mexico, do not offer any clues as to where John might be staying. A motel is typically a budget option rather than an upscale one, and a restaurant is not a typical place to stay overnight.
pass sentence | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge made a decision regarding the guilty party, which is commonly done by passing a sentence. Passing sentence refers to the formal declaration of a person's punishment after being found guilty of a crime. The other options do not make sense in this context; instructing the jury happens before a verdict is reached, fighting and wrestling are not typical actions for a judge to take, and illustrating a point is not related to the situation described.
desire to advance | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is ambitious and driven, with a strong work ethic. The phrase "go getter" implies that they are proactive and always looking for opportunities to succeed. The phrase "hard worker" reinforces this idea. The phrase "liked being in the company" suggests that the person enjoys being around others, which may be important for networking and advancing in their career. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Keep busy" is redundant with "hard worker," "labor in vain" is the opposite of ambition, "wait for a raise" implies passivity, and "briefcase" is unrelated.
eat | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person's cupboards were empty, which suggests that they did not have any food to eat. Therefore, they had to go to work to earn money in order to buy food. The other options, such as taking a bus or sleeping, do not relate to the context of needing to go to work in order to satisfy a basic human need like hunger.
crying | Knowledge: The fact that James is watching a film suggests that he is likely emotionally invested in the story and characters. The detail about the dog being shot implies that this is a sad or tragic moment in the film. The option "crying" is the most logical choice as it is a common emotional response to a sad event in a film. The other options are unlikely to be the correct answer as they do not fit with the emotional tone of the sentence or the context of James watching a film.
fairgrounds | Knowledge: The word "show" suggests that this question is referring to a livestock or agricultural event, such as a county fair or sheep show. Fairgrounds are a common location for these types of events, and it makes sense that sheep would go there to participate in a show. Walmart, wolf, and meadow do not have any clear connection to this context, and while farms may have sheep, they would not typically be a location for a sheep show.
working | Knowledge: The question is asking about what a person is not doing when they are beginning work, which implies that they have not started working yet. Resting and tiredness are not relevant to the question, as they are not opposite actions to beginning work. Accomplishing and momentum also have no clear connection to the context of the question.
imagination | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that God created a unique and unusual animal, the platypus. This implies that God has a creative imagination, as the platypus is not a typical or expected animal. The other options (store, synagogue, everything) are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any clues about what the creation of the platypus indicates about God. While compassion is a characteristic often associated with God, it is not directly referenced in the sentence.
record albums | Knowledge: Vinyl records are played using a turntable or record player, which requires a physical vinyl record album to play the music. The other options, such as a record store or car, may be places where vinyl records could be purchased or listened to, but they are not the actual method of playing the vinyl record. Omlinr and wallpaper are not related to vinyl records or playing music.
have cancer | Knowledge: The sentence is phrased in the negative and asks for something that does not happen to all cats. While all cats might cross roads, drink water, excrete, and breathe air, not all cats develop cancer. Cancer is a disease that affects some cats but not all, so it is the correct answer in this context.
bedside table | Knowledge: The question asks specifically about where to keep a book to read before bed, which suggests that the answer should be a location near the bed. The term "bedside" further emphasizes this association, as it refers to a table that is typically positioned next to the bed for easy access during the night. The other options, such as school room and classroom, do not have any relevance to the context of the question. An allen key is a tool used to assemble furniture, and a coffee table is typically located in a living room or other common area.
knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that faith is a type of belief that does not require knowledge. If one has knowledge, then they do not need to rely on faith to form their beliefs. The other options do not make sense in this context.
drawer | Knowledge: Stamps are small and flat, so they can easily fit into a drawer for safekeeping. A table or desk may not provide enough protection for stamps from dust or damage, while a suitcase is not a typical storage option for stamps. A cabinet could work, but drawers are a more common and practical option for small items like stamps.
illness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that excessive drinking can cause a health problem that persists over time, which is commonly associated with chronic illnesses. Excessive drinking is a known risk factor for a range of health problems, including liver disease, heart disease, and some cancers. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they focus on acute outcomes rather than long-term health consequences.
carefree | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe did not worry or stress about small things, which is a characteristic commonly associated with being carefree. The other options imply negative qualities like not caring at all, being indifferent or careless, or having an inflated sense of self-importance (arrogant). Sarah's insistence that Joe was just carefree implies that she sees this as a positive quality rather than a negative one.
pleasurable | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen enjoyed listening to music, which indicates that it brought him some form of satisfaction or enjoyment. The term "pleasurable" is a likely fit for the context of the sentence as it indicates a positive experience. The other options do not fit the context as they are either negative experiences (deafness and tinnitus) or do not convey enjoyment (relaxing and fun).
live well | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person started exercising for the purpose of improving their overall well-being. "Live well" is a common phrase used to describe a state of good health and happiness, which can be achieved through regular exercise. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are unrelated to exercise and physical health.
attend school | Knowledge: Learning animal taxonomic names requires a deep understanding of biology and classification systems. Attending school would provide Jane with the knowledge and resources she needs to achieve her goal. While reading books or visiting museums can be great resources for learning about animals, these options may not provide the comprehensive education that attending school would offer. Memorizing names without understanding the underlying biology and classification systems may not be practical or useful in the long run.
one body | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans are fragile and should be taken care of, which implies that the answer involves something related to the body. The phrase "you only get" suggests that this is something that cannot be replaced or obtained again. Muscles, mouth, and two arms are specific parts of the body, but the sentence refers to the body as a whole. Stupidity is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "one body" which emphasizes the importance of taking care of one's physical health.
death | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman was overly concerned about her infant's sleeping position due to articles she had read, indicating that the articles may have contained information about potential dangers associated with incorrect sleeping positions. The mention of vaccines and erections do not logically connect with the context of the sentence, and nightmares and dreams do not imply the same level of concern as the other options.
increased efficiency | Knowledge: Using a computer is often associated with increased efficiency because it can help individuals perform tasks more quickly and accurately than they would be able to do manually. Some common uses for computers include creating documents, analyzing data, communicating with others, and accessing information. While it is possible that someone might use a computer for stress relief, pleasure, or to conquer the world in a hypothetical scenario, these options are not typically associated with the practical reasons people use computers in their daily lives.
gain weight | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's eating habits were not moderate or reasonable, which could have led to him overeating and consuming more calories than his body needs, resulting in weight gain. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
office | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Jenny's job involves answering the phone and taking messages, which is a task commonly associated with office work. The message she received is also described as important and related to a big project, which suggests a professional setting rather than a personal one like a friend's house or a party. Therefore, the best answer is office.
united states | Knowledge: The question is asking about where you can get on a highway in three different cities - San Diego, Omaha, and Atlanta. The answer that makes the most sense is "United States," since all of these cities are located in the United States, where there are many highways. The other options (repairs, desert, atlas, countryside) do not provide a logical answer to the question.
waiting room | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that there are many seats in a single room or area where people are waiting for something. A restaurant or rest area may have many seats, but they would likely not all be couches, and not everyone would be sitting on them. An apartment or neighbor's house would not have many couches with people sitting on them unless there was a gathering or event taking place. A waiting room, on the other hand, commonly has many couches or chairs where people wait for appointments, meetings, or other events.
sanctuary | Knowledge: An altar is typically found within a sanctuary, which is an area in a church or temple usually reserved for religious rituals and ceremonies. Standing at a cross, church services, and ceremony are not specific locations where one would typically find an altar.
basement | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill's power is out, which indicates that there is likely an issue with his electrical system. If this is the case, he would need to check his breaker box, which is typically located in the basement or another utility room. The other options do not make sense in this context and are not related to electrical systems.
candle | Knowledge: The other options do not necessarily require a light source to use. The context of the sentence suggests that the answer should be something that you need to see in the dark. The only option that fits this description is a candle, as it provides a portable source of light that can be carried around with you.
math problem | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a number is a common answer to something, and the options provide a list of different things that could require an answer. However, only math problems typically have a numerical answer. Telephone books provide contact information, Chinese takeaway menus list food options, statistics involve data analysis, and roulette wheels involve chance. Therefore, the correct answer must be a math problem, where a numerical answer is expected.
longing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Victor experienced something emotional when he saw people playing the game and remembered his own experience playing it. The word "remember" implies that he had a positive experience playing the game, and the fact that he felt something when he saw others playing it suggests that he misses that experience. The word "longing" best fits the context of the sentence, indicating a strong desire to experience that feeling again. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
have eyes | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a prerequisite for watching a film, and it is stated explicitly that this requirement is related to vision. The correct answer, therefore, must be an option that confirms the necessity of having functional eyes, which is required to see the images on screen. The other options are not relevant, as they either describe actions (such as going to the movies or opening one's eyes) or possessions (glasses or Netflix) that are not directly related to the ability to see.
transportation cost | Knowledge: The question is asking about a reason someone might stop driving to work and take the bus instead. One factor that could influence this decision is the cost of transportation. If driving to work becomes too expensive due to factors such as gas prices or tolls, it may be more cost-effective to take public transportation like a bus. The other options do not necessarily relate to the decision to take the bus over driving.
prepared | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is traveling in cold weather, which would require preparation with warm clothing and gear. Being warm is important, but it is implied that being prepared with the right clothing is necessary to achieve that warmth. Being amiable or baking have no relation to traveling in cold weather, and being clothed is a basic necessity that is assumed in the context.
fall in love | Knowledge: The question is asking for a universal desire that all humans have in relation to people of the opposite sex. While laying eggs, feeling comfortable, working hard, and kissing may be desirable for some individuals, they are not universal desires in the context of the question. Falling in love, on the other hand, is a common desire for many people regardless of gender or cultural background.
go deep sea fishing | Knowledge: The question is asking about what to do after bringing home fish, which implies that the person has already gone fishing. The option "go to market" suggests that the person is buying fish rather than catching it themselves. "Rent a boat" and "reconsider" do not make sense in the context of the question. "Go fishing" is too broad and does not provide any specific information about where to go fishing. Therefore, the most appropriate option is "go deep sea fishing," which suggests that the person caught the fish in the ocean rather than a river or lake.
arena | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the team is participating in some sort of event or competition, and entering through a central passage. The word "arena" is commonly associated with events such as sports, concerts, or performances, which fits with the idea of a team entering through a central passage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe believes that loving someone will bring him a positive emotion. The options "wonderful," "enjoyment," and "satisfaction" also connote positive emotions, but "happiness" is the most general term and could encompass all of these emotions. "Jealousy" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it is a negative emotion and not typically associated with romantic relationships.
carpal tunnel syndrome | Knowledge: Typing too much is known to cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a painful condition that affects the wrists, hands, and fingers. This is commonly seen in people who work on computers for long hours and type excessively. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: A crowded motorway is most likely to be found in a city, as cities tend to have higher populations and more traffic congestion than rural areas. The other options are less likely to have a crowded motorway - Europe is a continent, England is a country, a garage is a small space used for car repairs, and New Jersey is a state known for its highways but not necessarily for having crowded motorways.
sweating | Knowledge: Sweating is a natural bodily response during physical activity, including jogging. It is the body's way of regulating temperature and cooling down. Breath problems, exhaustion, shortness of breath, and shin splints may also be experienced during and after jogging, but they are not directly related to the question of what the body will be doing.
make sound | Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally can't talk, which implies that her throat injury is affecting her ability to produce sound. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide a plausible explanation for why Sally can't speak.
headache | Knowledge: The other options all suggest possible ways to improve or continue the analysis, while a headache is an external factor that could prevent someone from analyzing. The sentence implies that the person is unable to analyze because they have a headache, which is a physical symptom that can make it difficult to concentrate or focus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tailor shop | Knowledge: The phrase "cut to order" suggests that the fabric is being cut specifically for a customer's needs. This is a service typically offered at shops that specialize in custom clothing, such as tailor shops. Curtain stores may offer pre-cut lengths of fabric, but they are usually not cut to order. Clothing stores may offer some customization options, but they typically do not cut fabric on-site. Sewing rooms may offer this service, but it is not a commonly used term. Hardware stores do not typically sell fabric or offer cutting services.
ground | Knowledge: A dustbin is typically used for collecting waste and is usually placed on the ground for easy access. It is unlikely to be found in a utility closet, cupboard, or broom closet as these spaces are not typically used for waste collection. While some kitchens may have a trash can, the term "dustbin" is more commonly used in outdoor or public settings where waste is collected on the ground.
grocery store | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is a location where food items are sold or displayed on shelves. The option "bookcase" does not fit this context as it is typically used for storing books, not food. "Displaying framed photos" is also not a likely answer as shelves used for displaying framed photos are typically found in homes, not public spaces where people shop for food. "Gas station" may have some food items for sale, but it is not the main purpose of a gas station. "Chest of drawers" is also not a likely answer as it is typically used for storing clothes or other personal items. Thus, "grocery store" is the most appropriate answer.
calcium | Knowledge: Calcium is a mineral that is crucial for bone development and is found in dairy products, including milk. Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk but does not contribute directly to bone development. Water is a liquid that does not contain any significant nutrients. Metal is a broad category that does not relate to this specific question. Fridge is an appliance and is not relevant to the question.
office park | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's job is located at a reception desk, which is commonly found in an office setting. Additionally, the person has a long commute, which implies that they live further away from their workplace. Of the options given, "office park" is the most closely related to the context of the sentence as it suggests a collection of buildings that are primarily used as office spaces. The other options, such as "motel" or "lunch restaurant," are not particularly relevant to the context of the sentence.
injury | Knowledge: The question asks what to avoid while playing ball, and injury is a common risk associated with physical activity. It is important to take proper precautions to prevent injuries, such as warming up before playing and wearing appropriate protective gear. Competition and losing may be part of the game, and hitting the ball and having fun are usually encouraged.
There is no correct answer, as it depends on the specific town and its customs or stores.  |  | Knowledge: The question does not provide enough context or information to determine where exactly sugar would be found in a town. It could be available in coffee shops, grocery stores, or even in people's homes. Therefore, it is important to consider the context before making an assumption on where sugar may be found.
public place | Knowledge: The sentence implies that revolving doors are not common in private homes, which suggests that they are more commonly found in public places. Of the five options, public place is the most general and includes places like shopping centers, office buildings, airports, and hospitals, all of which are common locations for revolving doors. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
alive | Knowledge: The opposite of being dead is a state of being alive. Being alive means that the person or organism is not dead and is currently functioning, which is opposite to being lifeless. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
dog show | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the small dog is being considered for participation in a competition. Dog shows are a popular type of competition where dogs are judged based on their adherence to breed standards, obedience, and other factors. Other options such as basket, triathlon, animal shelter, and own home are not likely to be relevant to a competition involving a small dog.
music shop | Knowledge: A tuning fork is a musical instrument that is commonly used to tune other instruments, such as guitars or pianos. As a result, it is likely that a music shop would carry tuning forks. The other options, such as a hardware store or science lab, would not have any reason to stock tuning forks.
children's song | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family TV personality dressed as a weasel is likely entertaining children, which is often associated with singing children's songs. It is unlikely that he would be playing in a chicken coop or a used car lot, and being dead doesn't make sense in this context. The location of Washington D.C. also doesn't seem to have any relevance to the sentence.
England | Knowledge: The phrase "merry old" is commonly used to refer to England, so it can be inferred that the speaker is referring to a trip to England. Additionally, the mention of a teakettle suggests that the speaker may have visited a tea room or been exposed to English tea culture, which is well-known for its emphasis on afternoon tea and tea-drinking traditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to England or teakettles.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam enjoyed getting drunk for a particular reason. The context clues within the sentence imply that he is seeking something positive, indicating that he likely drinks for relaxation rather than negative outcomes like nausea, vomiting, or fighting. Additionally, alcohol is a common substance used for relaxation purposes.
nursery | Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about a bottle used to feed a new human, which suggests that the answer is related to infants. The options "supermarket," "grocery store," and "vending machine" are less likely to carry specialized infant products like feeding bottles. "Liquor store" is completely unrelated to the context of the question. "Nursery," on the other hand, is a place where infant products like feeding bottles are commonly found.
wall | Knowledge: Hanging a picture typically refers to placing it on a vertical surface, such as a wall. The other options are not typically associated with hanging artwork. A desktop or table may be used to display small pieces of art, but the verb "hang" implies a larger piece on a wall. Newspaper and ceiling are not appropriate places to hang a picture.
different | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child has certain qualities or characteristics that may set him apart from others, and that his mother is reassuring him that it's okay to be different. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence.
do well | Knowledge: The word "encourage" suggests that the principal was trying to motivate or inspire students to do something positive. In the context of a school setting, it is likely that he was encouraging them to do their best academically. The phrase "try hard" also reinforces the idea of putting effort into schoolwork or studying. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence; wearing shoes and playing computer games, for example, are not things that the principal would likely be discussing in this context.
gain wealth | Knowledge: The use of the words "younger" and "risky" suggest that the goal of the investor is likely to be focused on maximizing returns, as younger investors generally have a longer investment horizon and are willing to take on more risk in order to achieve higher returns. In addition, the phrase "risky investor" indicates that the individual may be comfortable with volatile or high-risk investments, which are typically chosen with the aim of generating higher returns. The other choices - back project, lose money, sell stock, and save money - are unlikely to be goals of a younger, risky investor.
adequate | Knowledge: The question suggests that the person does not want either bad service or very good service. Therefore, they may be looking for service that is in the middle or just "good enough." The word "adequate" implies that something is enough or satisfactory, but not necessarily exceptional. The other options all suggest some level of high quality or speed, which goes against what the person is looking for in this scenario.
managed | Knowledge: The sentence states that John was in good hands despite suffering from mental illness and that he would have to be on drugs for the rest of his life. This suggests that his condition is manageable but not curable. The option "effectively treated" contradicts this because John's condition is not curable, while "managed" aligns with the idea that John will need ongoing drug therapy to manage his condition. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
town | Knowledge: The question asks for a location where buildings are likely to be small, and of the options given, "town" is the most likely answer. This is because towns typically have smaller populations and less space for large buildings compared to large cities or universities. "Underground" is not a likely answer because buildings found underground are often large and sprawling, such as subway stations or malls. "Ant town" is not a real location and has no relevant context to the question.
wooded area | Knowledge: Beavers are known for building dams out of sticks and branches. Therefore, they would need to have access to a source of these materials in order to build their dams. A wooded area would be the most likely place for a beaver to find the necessary materials. The other options, such as a zoo, body of water, or Home Depot, do not provide the natural materials that a beaver would need to construct a dam. Books are obviously not a source of physical materials.
spare time | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who works 14 hours a day will have very little of something, which indicates that it is a resource that is limited or scarce. The options "sleep" and "care about" could be logically connected to working long hours, but the sentence specifically mentions "very little," which rules out those options since they are absolute quantities. "Know everything" is not directly related to the context of the sentence and is not a logical consequence of working long hours. "Own house" is also not a logical consequence of working long hours and is not directly related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, "spare time" is the correct answer since it is a resource that is likely to be scarce for someone who works long hours.
learn music | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the teacher recommended playing piano as a way to introduce the student to something related to music. Learning an instrument is often associated with learning music theory and developing an understanding of musical structure, which may explain why the teacher suggested playing piano as a starting point. The other options do not have a clear connection to the sentence, as they either describe a process of learning or practicing an instrument, rather than a broader introduction to music.
gallbladder | Knowledge: The phrase "it turned out it wasn't a kidney stone" implies that the object in question was found in a different part of the body. The most likely choice from the given answer options is the gallbladder, as it can also produce stones. The other options, such as creek bed, driveway, river bed, and gravel, are not related to bodily organs and do not fit the context of the sentence.
wine country | Knowledge: Grapes are the primary source of wine, and wine grapes tend to be smaller than table grapes. Wine country refers to regions where grapes are grown for the purpose of making wine, so it is the most likely answer. The other options (lunch box, food store, kitchen, raisins) are not associated with grapes that are specifically small.
grocery shop | Knowledge: Since the sentence mentions hunger and boredom, the best option would be grocery shopping as it would help to alleviate hunger while also providing an opportunity for stimulation through selecting and preparing food. The other options do not address the specific needs mentioned in the sentence. Taking a nap may provide temporary relief from boredom, but it won't address hunger. Doing a crossword puzzle or seeing art may help with boredom but won't address hunger. Playing games may provide entertainment but again won't address the issue of hunger.
falling asleep | Knowledge: The phrase "before going to bed" suggests that the woman was in the process of preparing for sleep, so it is likely that she was not actively engaging in any activities that would require significant effort (such as cooking food). Furthermore, the fact that she had a "vision" implies that she was in a state of altered consciousness or dreaming, so the correct answer is likely "falling asleep." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
valley | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you are driving through a feature after following a road toward a river. A common feature that one might encounter when driving toward a river is a valley. A valley is a low area of land between hills or mountains, often with a river or stream flowing through it. Therefore, the correct answer is valley, while the other options do not make sense in the given context.
own home | Knowledge: The question is asking about a common goal that adults with families may have, and the option "own home" is the most logical choice as it is a common desire among many families. People often strive to own their own home as it provides stability, security, and a place to raise a family. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or the goals of adults with families.
own things | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a characteristic that is commonly associated with being rich. Owning things is often seen as a sign of wealth, as people who have more money are able to purchase expensive items such as cars, homes, and luxury goods. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
abandoned | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog's behavior is related to being abandoned by its owners. This traumatic experience can cause dogs to become fearful of humans and not trust them, even if they are treated kindly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
rest in bed | Knowledge: Resting in bed is commonly recommended for tiredness and fatigue, as it allows the body to rest and recharge. Going for a run may actually tire a person out more, while watering plants and catching a cold are not relevant to the question. Lying in bed is also an option, but it may not necessarily lead to feeling refreshed unless the person is actually resting and relaxing.
pub | Knowledge: Pubs are commonly known for selling alcohol and also providing food options. Chemistry labs, parties, and supermarkets do not typically sell alcohol, and restaurants may sell alcohol but do not typically advertise themselves as a place to buy alcohol without also providing a meal. Therefore, the correct answer is likely a pub.
captivity | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bald eagle was captured, which usually implies that it was taken into captivity. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be locations where a captured bird would spend the rest of its life.
control panel | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan turned a knob to transfer control to Andy, which is a common feature found in control panels. Control panels are used to operate various systems such as sound and lighting systems, machinery, and electronic devices. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
bedstand | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe keeps his comb near a mirror, which is often found on a bedstand or a vanity table. The other options are less likely because a medicine cabinet is typically in a bathroom, a suitcase is for traveling, a barber shop is a public place, and a pocket is a personal item that Joe would have with him.
city | Knowledge: The sentence mentions skyscrapers, which are tall buildings commonly found in urban areas or cities. A thoroughfare is also a term used to describe a main road or street in a city. The other options, such as traffic or country, do not accurately describe the context of the sentence.
malaise | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Bill had a negative feeling that caused him to stay home from work for a week. The word "malaise" specifically refers to a general feeling of discomfort or unease, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options (sad, stress, painless, boredom) do not necessarily imply an illness or physical discomfort, which is suggested by the sentence.
dangerous | Knowledge: The sentence implies that diving into the deep ocean is both dark and dangerous. The word "dangerous" is a clear contrast to the other options, which do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Light" would not apply to the deep ocean, and "shallow" and "frivolous" suggest a lack of seriousness, which is not appropriate for the dangerous activity of deep-sea diving.
chess game | Knowledge: The phrase "king me" is commonly associated with the game of checkers, where one player declares to "king" their piece when it reaches the opposite side of the board. However, in context, the sentence suggests that the speaker made a mistake while playing a different game where "king me" is not a common phrase. The other options (scrabble, deck of cards, castle) do not involve moves or phrases that are similar to "king me," leaving chess game as the most likely option. In chess, the phrase "check" and "checkmate" are commonly used, and the term "king" is relevant because it is one of the pieces on the board.
human face | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the artist was painting a specific part of a larger object or subject, and that part happens to be the lips. The most logical option in this case would be the human face, as that is a common subject in art where the lips would be a distinguishable feature. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
french government | Knowledge: The term "bureau" can refer to a government agency or department, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States. In the context of the question, it is asking where a bureau might be "in charge," which suggests a position of authority or leadership. The French government would fit this description, as it is a centralized government with many bureaus and departments that oversee various areas of policy and administration. The other options do not necessarily imply a position of authority or leadership.
skinny | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is already on the thinner side but still feels the need to lose more weight. "Skinny" is the only option that directly relates to being thin or having a low body weight. "Feel better," "lift weights," and "healthy" do not necessarily indicate anything about the person's weight status. "Under weight" could be a possibility, but "skinny" is a more commonly used term in everyday language.
zoo | Knowledge: The question is asking where mammoths never existed. The options "wild," "North Dakota," and "forest" are all locations where mammoths may have once lived. The option "movie" is irrelevant to the question. The only option that definitively would not have had mammoths is a zoo, as they have been extinct for thousands of years and are not currently kept in captivity.
space shuttle | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the food is freeze-dried or dehydrated, which suggests that it is being prepared in a way that preserves it for a long time without refrigeration. This is important for space travel, where fresh food is not always available and there are limited options for storage. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the need for food preservation.
container | Knowledge: The definition of a container is an object used to hold or transport something. The other options, such as kitchen, backpack, jar, and bowl, may have the capability to hold items but are not specifically designed for that purpose.
dress herself | Knowledge: The question is asking about a typical behavior or action of an adult woman when getting ready for work. Based on societal norms and expectations, it is most likely that a woman would dress herself and put on make-up. Drinking beer or dressing himself would be uncommon behaviors for an adult woman in this context. "Work" is a possible choice, but it is too general and does not specify the action of getting ready for work.
city | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James wants a lot of traffic, which is more likely to be found in high-density urban areas such as cities. Suburbs and suburban towns may have less traffic, while the desert and vacant stores are not likely to have any traffic at all.
distance themselves | Knowledge: The use of the word "stop" implies that the question is asking how someone can end their status as a lover, rather than how they can improve their skills as a lover. "Distance themselves" is the most logical choice, as creating distance between oneself and a romantic partner is a common way to end a relationship. The other options do not address the question of how to stop being a lover, and some of them could actually deepen a person's feelings of love.
bathroom | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is considering the safety implications of using a hair dryer in an environment that is wet and steamy. The most likely place for this to occur is in a bathroom after taking a hot shower. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
socks | Knowledge: The question suggests that finding the right shoe is not enough on its own, and that something else is needed. One common accessory to wear with shoes is socks, which provide comfort and hygiene. The other options do not have any clear connection to shoes or finding the right fit.
building | Knowledge: Shareholders typically gather in a building for meetings, such as a corporate headquarters or a designated meeting venue. A den is too small for a large group of shareholders and financial trouble or a factory are not relevant to the context of the question. A large company may have a building for meetings, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
increase knowledge | Knowledge: This answer is supported by the common belief that one of the primary reasons people learn is to acquire new knowledge. The other answer choices may be additional benefits or outcomes of learning, but they do not fully capture the fundamental reason why people engage in learning activities. Empowering, improved performance, and becoming more intelligent are all positive results of learning, but they are not the primary motivation behind it. Additionally, "have more knowledge" is similar to the correct answer, but is not quite as specific.
inspiration | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob's visit to the museum had a positive impact on him, namely that it gave him something that he did not have before. Since the sentence describes Bob as a creative person, it is likely that the "something" he gained from the museum was related to his creativity. The context of the sentence suggests that Bob was inspired by the exhibits at the museum, which would lead to greater creativity. The other options, such as boredom and lethargy, have a negative connotation and do not fit the context of the sentence.
downtown area or major city | Knowledge: Nightclubs are typically found in urban areas with a high population density where people go out at night to socialize and have fun. Major cities like New York and Los Angeles are known for having a vibrant nightlife scene, especially in the downtown areas where there are numerous bars and clubs in close proximity. While it is possible for a nightclub to be located beside a river or in a building, these options are less likely based on their general characteristics and the context of the question.
rock band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a group called The Blowfish who create music specifically for their lead singer. The term "blowfish" is not directly related to any of the other choices, which eliminates them as potential answers. Additionally, "rock band" is the best choice because it matches the context of the sentence and is a term commonly used to describe musical groups that play rock music.
tiredness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending a long time walking a dog may result in a feeling, which is likely to be related to physical exhaustion or fatigue. The option "picking up after dog" is not a feeling but an action that may be associated with walking a dog. "Sore feet" is a possibility, but tiredness is the most common outcome of physical activity. "Sick" and "pride" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Rome | Knowledge: The Trevi Fountain is a well-known landmark in Rome, Italy. The other answer choices do not have any connection to the location of the fountain.
accomplishment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after successfully climbing a difficult ascent, you experience a feeling or a sense. Getting higher and vertigo may be temporary sensations that occur during the climb, but they do not relate to the sense you feel afterward. Exhaustion may be a result of climbing, but it does not express the feeling you gain after completing the climb. Fear of heights is the opposite of what you would feel after successfully completing a climb. Accomplishment makes sense as it implies a positive feeling of achievement after overcoming a challenge.
sheath | Knowledge: A sheath is a protective cover for a sword, typically made of leather or other durable material. If someone is holding a sword but doesn't need to use it, the logical action would be to sheath it to prevent any accidental harm or damage to the sword. The other options, such as salon or collection, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
patient | Knowledge: The sentence provides the context that Sally worked at a dentist office and had to work late. It's likely that she had to work late to attend to a patient who needed extra care or had an unexpected complication. The other options, such as the office building, town, office desk or Michigan, do not provide any relevant information that would explain why Sally had to work late.
understanding | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not initially comprehend the subject, but gained something after studying it for a while. "Understanding" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence structure and the meaning of the word. "New perspective" could also be a possible answer, but it is not as specific and does not directly state that the person gained comprehension. "Increasing knowledge," "more intelligence," and "inspiration" do not fit as well since they do not specifically describe the person's change in comprehension.
nature reserve | Knowledge: Bald eagles are known for being a native species of North America, particularly in countries like Canada and the United States. They are also commonly found near bodies of water such as lakes or rivers, where they hunt for fish. The other options, such as France or toy stores, do not have any clear connection to the natural habitat of bald eagles. A nature reserve, on the other hand, would be a suitable environment for bald eagles to live in as it provides a protected and natural habitat for various species to thrive.
Capitol building | Knowledge: The sentence specifically mentions that the building houses the U.S. Congress, which narrows down the options significantly. Out of the choices given, only the Capitol building is commonly associated with the U.S. government and Congress. The other options are either too broad (country) or not located in the right city (Florida) to be correct. Democracies are forms of government, but the sentence is asking for the name of a building. Washington D.C. is the location of the Capitol building, but it is not the name of the building itself.
shake hands | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people reached some sort of agreement or form of cooperation and sealed it by doing something. In many cultures, shaking hands is a customary way of ending a meeting or agreeing on something, so it is the most likely choice. The other options, such as feeling good or appreciating each other, do not necessarily involve a physical action that would seal a deal. Kissing or smiling may be inappropriate in professional or formal settings.
working correctly | Knowledge: The phrase "ticking" refers to the sound a clock makes when it is working correctly and the hands are moving steadily around the clock face. Therefore, the likely status of a clock that is ticking is that it is working correctly. The other options all suggest some sort of malfunction or failure, but the phrase "ticking" implies regular working order.
yellow | Knowledge: Yellow is a very common color in flowers, as many different types of flowers come in shades of yellow or have yellow accents. For example, sunflowers, daffodils, and marigolds are all well-known flowers that are typically yellow. While the other choices in this question may be related to flowers in some way (such as fragrant flowers or different types of flowering plants), only yellow is directly associated with the color of flowers.
auditorium | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the event in question is a graduation ceremony for students, which usually takes place in an auditorium or a similar event space. A theatre, show, concert hall, or opera would not be typical locations for a graduation ceremony. The word "stage" in the question also supports the idea that the event is taking place in an auditorium, as auditoriums usually have a raised platform area for performances or events.
person's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane was driving back home from Mexico to Toronto when she bought the dog, indicating the location where the dog was bought was likely somewhere along the way. The option "person's house" is the most likely answer as it suggests that Jane may have purchased the dog from an individual she met on her trip. The other options do not provide any context or relevance to the sentence.
reward | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after assisting a person who has lost their wallet, something is customarily given. A reward is a common way to show appreciation for someone's help, especially when it involves returning lost items. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this scenario.
movement | Knowledge: The use of the word "still" indicates that the child was already in the process of going somewhere. Out of the options provided, only "movement" could indicate that the child was still on the move. "Arriving" suggests that the child had already reached the destination, "driving" is a method of transportation rather than an indication of progress, "excitement" could be a result of arriving at the destination or undergoing a change in plans, and "expense" has no relevance to the context. Therefore, "movement" is the correct answer.
do work  | Knowledge: The phrase "cutting edge technology" implies that computers are advanced and sophisticated machines that are primarily designed to perform tasks or work. Networking and connecting are features of computers that allow them to communicate with other devices but doesn't convey the idea of what computers are primarily designed to do. Costing money is also not a characteristic unique to computers, as all products have a price. Teaching is not related to the context of the sentence, as computers might be used as a tool for teaching, but it is not their primary function.
drawer | Knowledge: Stamps are small and easily lost, so it is likely that a person would want to store them in a place where they can access them easily and frequently. A drawer is a common storage solution for small items like stamps, coins, and other collectibles. The other options are not as suitable for storing small items or may not be easily accessible for frequent use.
fraternity house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject being described is likely a place or location where individuals consume excessive amounts of alcohol and may exhibit behaviors associated with high levels of testosterone, such as aggression or risk-taking. Fraternity houses are often associated with this type of environment, as they are typically places where young men socialize, drink, and engage in activities related to college life. The other options, such as beer or wine, are simply types of alcohol and do not provide any contextual clues to support them as the correct answer. The restaurant and pub options do not provide any contextual clues related to excessive alcohol or testosterone.
restaurants | Knowledge: The question suggests that the activity of slicing a steak and drinking alcohol can be done together in a certain location. The most logical option would be a restaurant, as they commonly serve alcohol with meals and have the necessary equipment to prepare and serve steak. The other options do not make sense in this context, as a chemistry lab, manual, and supermarket are not places where one would typically consume alcohol, and it is generally not allowed to drink alcohol in a pub while handling sharp objects.
enlightenment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning about the world has a positive outcome. The word "enlightenment" implies that gaining knowledge about the world leads to a deeper understanding and awareness, which is often associated with enlightenment. The other options (confusion, sadness, pleasure, and world views) do not necessarily align with the idea of gaining knowledge about the world.
feel remorse | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to the emotional aftermath of taking a life. "Feel remorse" is the most appropriate answer as it aligns with the commonly accepted view that killing another living being (whether human or animal) can elicit feelings of guilt, regret, and sorrow. "Hunger" and "commit crime" are unlikely answers as they do not pertain to the emotional or psychological effects of taking a life. "Take life" and "dies" are technically correct but are too general and do not capture the specific emotional state that the sentence is asking about.
own land | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the aboriginal people were displaced by settlers who used their lack of a formal system as justification. The most common reason for displacement of indigenous peoples by settlers is the desire for land, which is often tied to ideas of property ownership. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "own land", as the aboriginal people may not have had a formal system of property ownership that was recognized by the settlers. The other options do not have a clear link to the context of the sentence.
solutions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when a person has questions, they need to figure out something. This "something" is likely to be an answer or a solution to their questions. Dedication and confidence may be important in the process of finding answers, but they are not the specific thing that a person needs to figure out. Surprised and compliments are not at all related to finding answers to questions.
battlefield | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there was a conflict happening, but it was resolved peacefully without any casualties. The phrase "not a single drop of blood" indicates that the context of the sentence is referring to a situation where violence was expected or anticipated. The options "vein," "person," "paper," and "clinic" do not fit the context and are not related to conflict or violence.
have rest | Knowledge: The keyword "fatigue" suggests that the person is tired and needs to rest. Among the choices, "have rest" is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the person's need to relax and recharge. "Sleep" is also a good option, but it is more time-consuming than simply having a rest. "Sit on chair" and "stand up" do not necessarily provide relief from fatigue, while "sit down" is redundant as it doesn't provide any new information.
enjoyment | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that May found the film exciting and enjoyable, despite it being silly. The word "exciting" also adds to this idea of enjoyment. The other options like relaxation and sadness do not match the context of the sentence, while the option of "stupidity" seems inappropriate as a result of the positive language used to describe the film. The option of "masturbation" is also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
happy | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James attended Sarah's birthday party despite experiencing a recent loss, likely his father's death. The fact that he still went to the party implies that he wanted to help Sarah celebrate and be happy on her special day. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence.
learning | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person enjoyed attending lectures because they enjoyed something specific about the experience. The other options, such as applauding or going online, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Taking notes is also mentioned, but it is not necessarily the person's favorite way of participating in lectures. The most logical answer based on the context is that the person enjoyed attending lectures because it was their favorite way of learning.
suffering | Knowledge: The sentence implies that war has negative effects on citizens. The other options are also negative, but specifically refer to the outcome or nature of the war rather than its impact on citizens. "Suffering" is a more neutral term that encompasses a range of negative experiences that citizens may undergo during war, such as displacement, loss of loved ones, and psychological trauma.
not hungry | Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that James "couldn't stand the idea of having food," indicating that he had no appetite. The other options suggest physical discomfort or issues with digestion, which are not mentioned in the sentence.
learning | Knowledge: The sentence implies that spending time at a museum, looking at artifacts and listening to lectures, will result in some sort of educational outcome. The most logical answer is "learning," as the purpose of a museum is typically to educate visitors about history, culture, art, or other topics. The other options, such as "angry" or "pleasure," do not fit the context and are unlikely outcomes of visiting a museum. "Archeology" is a related topic but not specifically mentioned in the sentence as a direct outcome of visiting a museum.
pleasure | Knowledge: Serial killers are often motivated by a desire for pleasure or satisfaction from committing the crimes. It is not typically motivated by punishment or a desire to go to jail. The word "frolicking" seems out of place and does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. "Investigation" is a process involved in solving a crime, but is not a motive for committing one.
feel pain  | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking for a physiological response that an injured animal exhibits. Feeling pain is a common response that indicates an injury, while procreation, asexually reproducing, and biting are not necessarily connected to the question at hand. A distress call, on the other hand, may also be a sign of injury, but the emphasis on feeling pain in the sentence suggests that it is the best answer.
relaxation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is buying beer as a way to cope with a difficult workday. The most common reason for consuming alcohol after a stressful day is to relax and unwind. The other options (get arrested, losing money, pleasure, buzzed) do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely reasons for buying beer after a difficult workday.
help people | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being taken by police when getting ready to work is related to serving the public in some way. The phrase "getting ready to work" implies a preparatory action rather than an actual duty, which rules out options like "pull someone over" or "force law". Similarly, the phrase does not imply any aggressive action like "arming themselves," but rather a more helpful, community-oriented task like "helping people". "Directing traffic" is a possible option, but less likely as it is a more specific task and not necessarily related to police work as a whole.
sky | Knowledge: Balloons, when let go, will float upwards due to the principle of buoyancy. This means that they will go up into the air and eventually into the sky. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they are not relevant to the behavior of balloons when released.
jail | Knowledge: The phrase "doing time" is commonly used to refer to serving a sentence in jail or prison, suggesting that the person in the sentence is incarcerated. The sentence further suggests that the person has limited access to the outside world and that the newspaper is their only source of information or entertainment. The other options (floor, front door, reporter, porch) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
unpleasant odors | Knowledge: The sentence suggests a connection between eating asparagus and an unpleasant odor during urination. This is a commonly documented phenomenon where the breakdown of asparagus produces sulfur-containing compounds that give urine a distinct and often unpleasant smell. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
work hard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is spending all day at their job, which implies that they are likely working hard or putting in a lot of effort. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Gain weight" suggests that the person is inactive or eating too much, which is not necessarily related to their job. "Walk away" and "turn around" suggest that the person is leaving their job, which is the opposite of what the sentence implies. "Getting a burnout" is a possibility, but not a definitive answer.
taking notes | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone was using a shorthand typewriter to document or record something that was being said as testimony. Taking notes is a common activity during this type of activity, and shorthand typing is a fast and efficient way to do so. The other options, such as anger or nodding, do not make sense in the context of listening to testimony while using a typewriter.
palace | Knowledge: The word "royalty" suggests that the entrance hall was located in a place of authority or power, such as a royal palace. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence; a house or school entrance hall would be unlikely to have royalty in it, and a person or the outside do not fit with the description of a grandiose entrance hall.
cabinet | Knowledge: The question is asking about the location where people store extra toilet paper, implying that it is a common behavior. The context of the question suggests that the location is likely to be within the person's own home or living space. Of the options provided, only "cabinet" fits this criteria and is a logical location for storing extra toilet paper. The other options are either public spaces (grocery stores, restrooms) or unrelated to storage (bedroom).
burn plants | Knowledge: Burning plants would not be a typical task for a gardener, as it could potentially destroy the other plants and harm the overall garden. The other tasks listed are common responsibilities of a gardener, such as watering plants and gardens, and harvesting berries and flowers.
have patience | Knowledge: The word "wait" implies a delay or a period of time without action. The phrase "have patience" is often used as a synonym for waiting or enduring hardship without becoming angry or frustrated. The other options do not properly convey the meaning of waiting or suggest impatience. "Stay in one place" is a similar phrase but does not necessarily imply waiting or delay. "To waist time" is a misspelling of "waste time" and suggests a negative connotation of waiting, rather than a patient one. "1000nd" is not a word and has no association with waiting or patience.
express yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a dance is being discussed as a means of doing something, and the phrase "express yourself" is a common way of describing the act of conveying emotions, ideas, or personality through movement. The other options, such as "use the bathroom" or "like dancing", do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "express yourself" does.
bedside table | Knowledge: The question suggests that one person will be reading the book, and asks where it will be kept. The most likely location for a book that is being read by one person is their bedside table, as this is a common place for people to keep books they are currently reading. The other options, such as a school room or discount store, do not make sense in this context.
shop | Knowledge: Delicatessens are typically a type of shop that specializes in selling high-quality prepared foods, such as meats, cheeses, and sandwiches. The option "buy prepared foods" is similar but not specific enough, while "buy food" is too broad and could include any type of store or restaurant. "Large city" and "Michigan" are irrelevant to the context and do not provide any clues to help choose the correct answer.
rabbit warren | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the weasel found a treasure or something valuable when he discovered the maze of burrows. The options "mole den," "used car lot," "viking ship," and "chicken coop" do not make sense in this context. However, a "rabbit warren" is a collection of interconnected rabbit burrows, which can provide food and shelter for predators like weasels. Therefore, it is the most logical answer in this scenario.
thin | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crass men were talking about a woman they referred to as a "broad," which is a derogatory term for a woman. One of the men then stated that he thought she was "too" a certain characteristic, which implies that they were discussing the woman's physical appearance. The word "thin" is often used to describe a person who is not overweight or has a small body frame, which may be why the man thought she was "too" thin. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
contempt | Knowledge: The sentence implies that while the fighters maintained a professional level of respect, there was a personal level of disrespect between them. The word "contempt" means a feeling of disdain or dislike for someone or something, suggesting that the fighters held each other in a low regard because of things that were said. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not communicate a negative attitude that the fighters have towards each other.
table | Knowledge: A vase is a decorative item used for holding flowers, which are often used to enhance the ambiance of a restaurant. A table is a common place for a vase to be positioned, as it is a central location where it can be easily seen by customers. The other options, such as shelf, cabinet, windowsill, and bathroom, are less likely locations for a vase.
anger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned is not good at losing and exhibits a negative emotion when losing a game. The choice "anger" best fits this context as it is a common emotion associated with losing. The other choices - having fun, entertaining, enjoying, and injury - do not fit the context of the sentence.
shelf | Knowledge: The question is asking for a storage solution for a clock. While a clock can technically be stored in any of the options listed, the most practical and likely choice would be a shelf. A shelf provides a stable flat surface for the clock to sit on, and it allows for easy access to the clock when needed. The other options may not provide the same level of stability or accessibility for the clock.
music store | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the performer was in need of a new accordion, implying that he is a musician or a performer who uses this instrument. The most logical place for him to find a new accordion would be a music store, as they specialize in selling musical instruments. The other options do not relate to the situation described in the sentence, and therefore, they can be eliminated.
free flowing | Knowledge: The context suggests a description of honey that is not thick. Typically, honey is either thick or thin, and in this case, the opposite of thick is likely to be thin or free flowing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
relaxing | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is stressed and is seeking some relief by breathing fresh air. Relaxing is often associated with stress relief, as fresh air can provide a feeling of calmness and tranquility. Exhilaration and reviving are usually associated with intense physical activity, which may not be suitable for a stressed person. Feeling better and clear head are vague and could apply to a variety of situations, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
not to forget | Knowledge: Writing in a diary is often seen as a way to record memories and events so that they are not forgotten. Many people use a diary as a tool to keep track of important details in their life, such as appointments, thoughts or feelings, which they may want to reference later. Expressing oneself and recording thoughts are also common reasons for keeping a diary, but the specific wording of the question suggests that the primary purpose is to avoid forgetting important information. "Have to say" and "move fingers" are not commonly cited reasons for keeping a diary, and are not supported by the context of the question.
meadow | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bug was looking for wildflowers and wanted to avoid human interruption. A meadow is a natural open space filled with wildflowers and grass, which would be an ideal location for the bug to find what it was looking for without the possibility of human interruption. The other options (garden, bug zapper, rug, rock) do not have the natural setting suggested by the sentence, and some (bug zapper, rug) would actively repel the bug rather than attract it.
whitehouse, pantheon, roman architecture, greece | Knowledge: Buildings with columns are typically associated with ancient Greek and Roman architecture, as well as neoclassical styles, which were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. The White House in Washington D.C. is an example of neoclassical architecture, while the Pantheon in Rome is a famous ancient Roman building with columns. Spreadsheets are not related to architecture and do not have any columns in the traditional sense.
friend's house | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to borrow some chairs, which is a common practice among friends or family members. The other options such as office, bookstore, race track, and firehouse do not have a clear association with lending chairs, making them unlikely choices.
everything | Knowledge: The question implies that God created a lot of things before resting, so the correct answer must be something that encompasses everything that God created. The word "everything" in the choices is the only option that covers all of God's creations. The other options are not as comprehensive and do not fit the context of the sentence.
cold | Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of hot, which implies a temperature scale. The other options are not typically used as antonyms for hot. Freezing and chilled are related to temperature and are colder than hot, while lifeless and neutral do not have a clear connection to temperature.
works | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a helper monkey is doing something useful or helpful around the home of a disabled person. The word "works" suggests that the monkey is performing some kind of task or job, such as fetching items or helping with daily activities. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - treetops and disturb are not related to the concept of a helper monkey, and the mention of Nigeria and South American countries is irrelevant to the sentence.
rare | Knowledge: The sentence describes the diamonds as being difficult for the prospectors to find, which suggests that they were not commonly available. The word "rare" means something that is not easily found or limited in quantity, making it the most appropriate choice. The other options do not explain why the diamonds were hard to find and are therefore incorrect.
agitated | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat may have been giving a false impression of its behavior around the stranger, as it was actually ready to claw. The word "calm" is used as a contrast to the actual behavior of the cat, which suggests that it may have been masking its true feelings. The words "excited," "medium," and "frantic" do not capture the negative connotations associated with the word "claw," whereas "agitated" and "frenzied" do. However, "frenzied" implies a higher level of intensity compared to "agitated," making "agitated" the more appropriate answer.
fear of heights | Knowledge: The question implies that there is a psychological barrier preventing someone from climbing. Fear of heights is a common phobia that can cause physical symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and increased heart rate. "Getting higher" and "get higher" are redundant options and do not add any new information. "Sore muscles" implies physical discomfort but does not explain why someone would be unable to climb. "Short rope" is a technical limitation rather than a psychological one.
boutique | Knowledge: The question is asking where you might find a choker if you are not in a jewelry store or looking in a jewelry box. A choker is a type of necklace that fits closely around the neck, and it is often worn as a fashion accessory. Boutiques typically sell a variety of trendy and fashionable clothing and accessories, including chokers. The other options, such as a kennel or a pet store, are not likely to have anything to do with chokers.
store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are multiple items for sale along with the soda, which is a characteristic commonly associated with stores. Stores typically have a variety of products available, whereas vending machines usually only offer a limited selection. Health food stores may not carry soda at all, and liquid and picnic cooler are not typically places where one would buy a can of soda.
eat ice cream | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker desired something cold, which is an experience often associated with eating ice cream. While swimming or having a haircut may offer some relief from heat, they are not directly related to the craving mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, since "eat ice cream" is listed twice as a choice, it is likely the correct answer.
desk | Knowledge: The question suggests that the scissors are frequently used and therefore need to be easily accessible. The most common place to keep frequently used tools like scissors is on a desk or work surface where they can be easily reached. The other options do not provide a suitable location for easy access, as a cabinet or backpack requires extra effort to retrieve the scissors, a counter may not be a permanent work surface, and a house is not a specific location within a room.
bedroom | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the comforter was missing from the couple's sleep, which implies that it belonged in the bedroom where they were sleeping. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as a comforter is not typically found in the living room, linen closet, at the cleaners, or in the washing machine.
deli | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sandwiches were being made from a specific type of meat, which is likely to be found in a picnic basket. Options like country, camper, kitchen, and canned do not relate to meat specifically, but deli is a type of meat counter that often carries cold cuts like ham, turkey, and roast beef which are common sandwich fillings. Therefore, deli is the best option for the correct answer.
find food | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to have lunch, which implies that they are trying to find a location where they can purchase and consume food. The options "have time for," "prepare food," and "eat food" are not specific to the act of searching for a place to have lunch. "Satiate their appetite" is a possible answer, but it is less specific compared to "find food."
average | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being beautiful in Hollywood is not unusual or remarkable, implying that it is a common occurrence or expectation. Therefore, the answer is likely to be a term that suggests something ordinary or typical, which would be "average". The other options are all negatively charged words that do not fit the context of the sentence.
write letter | Knowledge: The phrase "warn of upcoming litigation" suggests that the solicitor is taking a preemptive action to notify someone of a potential legal issue. The most appropriate action in this situation would be for the solicitor to send a letter to the concerned parties, alerting them of the potential legal implications and to take appropriate measures to avoid the situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence; claiming compensation and charging according to time are actions that solicitors may take in response to a legal issue, while reporting to the government and buying a house do not have any relevance to the context.
express yourself | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that creativity is a means of self-expression, which is a common reason why people engage in creative activities such as art, writing, sewing, and generating ideas. The phrase "everybody has some sort of creativity" implies that creativity is a universal trait that is not limited to specific skills or talents. While creating art, writing, and sewing are also ways to express oneself, the phrase "best way to" indicates that expressing oneself is the most effective or preferred way among the options provided.
bloody mess | Knowledge: The phrase "brutal killing" suggests a violent and gory act, which would likely result in a bloody mess. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - pleasure and feeling of guilt suggest emotional reactions, being imprisoned suggests a legal consequence, and cake has no relevance to the topic.
see | Knowledge: The question is asking for a way to locate a jellyfish without physically approaching it. The option "see" would make the most sense as one could observe the location or movement of the jellyfish from a distance. The other options, such as using one's hand or finding a jellyfish in a store or zoo, do not address the question being asked. The mention of the Mediterranean Sea may be a distractor as it is not relevant to the question.
weight gain | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that overeating has negative consequences, and one of the most commonly known consequences of overeating is weight gain. Eating more calories than the body needs can lead to excess fat storage and ultimately result in an increase in body weight. The other options, such as digesting, constipation, not hungry, and gas, may occur as short-term consequences but do not have a significant association with long-term effects of overeating.
meet | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the spy had made contact with someone, and after doing so, they had to go somewhere. The most logical option would be "meet," as it is commonly used in this context to refer to a planned meeting or appointment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either irrelevant (have fun, whittle) or unlikely given the serious nature of spying (die, arriving).
turn right | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is driving and has slid into the outside lane. The phrase "up ahead" implies that there is some change that James will have to make, and the options listed all involve a change of direction. However, the sentence does not provide any context to suggest that James needs to take a U-turn, turn left, crash, or get to town. The most logical option is for James to turn right, as this would be a natural transition from being in the outside lane.
wonder what happened | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person in question witnessed an accident. In such a situation, it is common for people to wonder about the details of what happened as they try to make sense of the chaos around them. The other choices do not make sense in this context. Crossing the street, running away, or washing themselves are unlikely to be the primary concerns in this scenario, and feeling lucky is not a logical response to witnessing an accident.
urban region | Knowledge: The term "turnpike" refers to a highway or roadway that is built and maintained for the purpose of collecting tolls from drivers. Typically, turnpikes are located in more densely populated areas like urban regions where there is a greater need for transportation infrastructure. In contrast, rural areas such as the countryside are less likely to have turnpikes, as they typically have lower levels of traffic and are not as well-suited to collecting tolls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the meaning of the term "turnpike" in this context.
table | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman is hitting a table repeatedly in hopes of appearing more sober, even though she is still under the influence of alcohol. None of the other choices clearly relate to the context of the sentence. "Buying beer" might suggest that the woman is still drinking, while "alcoholism" might suggest a deeper and ongoing issue with addiction. "Aim" and "Michigan" do not have any clear connections to the sentence.
nodding  | Knowledge: Nodding is a common nonverbal gesture used to demonstrate agreement in many cultures. It involves moving the head up and down slightly, often accompanied by a smile or other facial expression of agreement. Handshakes are typically used as a form of greeting or agreement, but not specifically to show agreement. Kisses are often considered a romantic gesture and not commonly used to show agreement in most cultures. Lie and shaking hand are not appropriate responses as they are not positive ways of showing agreement.
getting fat  | Knowledge: Over-indulgence in food typically involves consuming more calories than the body needs, which leads to a buildup of excess fat. This can cause weight gain and eventually lead to obesity if it becomes a pattern. Therefore, option e) "getting fat" is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not reflect the consequences of over-indulgence in food.
opponent | Knowledge: The word "competing" implies that there is someone or something that the subject is trying to beat or outperform. "Effort" and "time" are not typically something one competes against. "Skill" and "competition" may be related to competing, but they do not indicate a specific rival or adversary. "Opponent" is the most appropriate choice as it directly refers to someone the subject is competing against.
bad breath | Knowledge: The sentence mentions onions, sardines, and garlic, which are all known for their strong odors and flavors. When consumed in large quantities, they can cause a person's breath to become quite pungent. Therefore, the most likely result of the guy's lunch would be bad breath, which is often considered an unpleasant side effect of eating foods with strong flavors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
jail | Knowledge: Breaking the law is a criminal act that can result in jail time. While schools and churches may have rules, they would not typically be the consequence for breaking the law. Love and foster care are also not appropriate choices as consequences for breaking the law.
prepare meals | Knowledge: The verb "hired" suggests that a person is being employed for a purpose or job. "Cooks" are typically hired for their ability to prepare meals, which is the primary function of their job. The other options - to be fired, season with salt, better food, perfect food - do not accurately reflect the job description of a cook.
singing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that birds are engaging in a behavior related to finding a mate. Among birds, singing is commonly associated with courtship and attracting a mate. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
attempting to communicate | Knowledge: The question is asking about the goal or purpose of talking, which is generally to convey information or express ideas to someone else in a way that they can understand. This is closely related to the concept of communication, which involves a sender encoding a message and a receiver decoding it. The other options, such as opera, making sound, or dry mouth, do not relate to the primary purpose of talking. "People to listen" is close to the correct answer, but it is not as specific or accurate as "attempting to communicate."
sexual excitement | Knowledge: Long kissing is often associated with physical intimacy and can lead to sexual arousal and excitement. Feeling good, pleasure, and being happy are all possible outcomes of kissing, but the term "long" suggests a more intense experience that may go beyond just feeling good. Bad breath is a negative consequence of poor oral hygiene and is not directly linked to long kissing.
sweat | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person lost a significant amount of weight after running a marathon (26 miles), which is likely due to the amount of sweat they produced during that time. Sweat is the body's natural way of regulating temperature during exercise, and a lot of sweat can result in a significant loss of water weight. The other options (exercise, pass out, collapse, drink water) are either too generic or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
better knowledge | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of analyzing something new will result in gaining better knowledge about that thing. Analysis typically involves breaking something down into its component parts in order to better understand it, which would lead to an increase in knowledge about the thing being analyzed. The other options do not accurately describe the outcome of analysis.
ballpark | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the event happening outside is likely a sports game or outdoor concert, which would typically take place at a ballpark or stadium. A movie theater or theater district would not be selling tickets for an event happening outside, and a theatre may or may not be selling tickets for an outdoor event. Street is also not a likely option as it is not a typical location for ticket sales.
humdrum | Knowledge: The question is asking for events that are typical and expected, but not divine. The word "divine" implies something supernatural or holy, so it can be inferred that the answer is referring to mundane or ordinary events. The word "humdrum" specifically means dull and unexciting, making it the most fitting choice among the options given. The other options, such as "godless" and "cursed," imply a negative or supernatural connotation that would not fit the context of the question.
awards ceremony | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person celebrated their success by giving a speech, which is commonly associated with awards ceremonies where individuals receive recognition for their achievements. Graveyards and vocations do not make sense in this context. "Working hard" and "various situations" are too general and do not provide any specific information to help us determine the correct answer.
winch | Knowledge: The phrase "steel cable called a wire rope" is commonly used to describe a type of strong and durable rope that is typically used for heavy lifting, pulling or hauling. Given the context of the question, the most likely application of this type of rope would be to provide tension and torque to a winch, which is commonly used in construction, transportation and heavy industry to lift and move heavy loads. The other options do not seem to fit the context or application of wire ropes.
music shop | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is looking to buy a harmonica to get started with playing it. A music shop would be the most likely place to find a variety of harmonicas to choose from and receive advice on which one to buy. The other options do not provide a plausible answer to the question.
open mind | Knowledge: The question is asking about what quality or trait would lead someone to learn about the world. Among the given choices, only "open mind" implies a willingness to explore and learn about different perspectives and ideas, which is necessary for gaining knowledge about the world. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
experience life | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is actively seeking out new experiences. The phrase "trying new things" implies a desire for novelty and excitement, which is more closely related to the goal of experiencing life rather than any of the other options. The other choices either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or are not related to the concept of trying new things.
public outcry | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a person in the neighborhood who is known to be hurting someone else, and the question is asking about the likely result of this situation. When a community becomes aware of this kind of behavior, they often react with outrage and demand action to be taken in order to protect the victim and ensure that the perpetrator is held accountable. This response is known as public outcry. The other options, like "more hurt," "people become happy," "legal problems," and "physical pain" do not seem like likely outcomes in this scenario.
cave | Knowledge: Fungi are often found in dark, damp environments with little to no sunlight. Caves provide this type of environment and are therefore more likely to have fungus growing in them compared to the other options listed. Shower stalls, basement, and toenails are not geological features, and while forests do provide a suitable environment for fungi, they are not a geological feature.
kitchen cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John bought a large quantity of salt, which is not typically used for immediate consumption. Therefore, it is more likely that he would store it in a place where he keeps other cooking ingredients such as a kitchen cupboard. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as a shaker would not hold 5 pounds of salt, sea water is not a storage location, falling down is irrelevant, and a fast food restaurant is not related to personal storage.
closet | Knowledge: A t-shirt is a type of clothing worn on the upper body, usually made of cotton or a similar fabric. It is commonly kept in a closet, along with other clothes. A suitcase is used for packing clothes when traveling, but it is unlikely that a t-shirt would be stored there. Underground is not a typical location for storing clothes. A shirtdress is a type of clothing, but it is not a location where clothes are kept. A drawer might be another option for storing clothes, but a closet is the most common and likely choice for a t-shirt.
secondary | Knowledge: When making a list, the main item is typically followed by secondary items. This is a common structure for organizing ideas and information in writing and speech. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Seattle | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John wants to eat at an Indian restaurant located on top of the Space Needle. The Space Needle is a famous landmark of Seattle, therefore, the correct answer is likely to be Seattle. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
home | Knowledge: Tabby cats, like most household cats, prefer to live in a safe and comfortable environment, which is typically a home. While some cats may be accustomed to living in alleyways or around dumpsters, this is not a preference for most cats. Likewise, while barns might provide shelter and food for some cats, tabby cats are generally more domesticated and prefer living inside homes where they can be close to their human companions. The key to the correct answer is understanding the specific characteristics and behaviors of tabby cats.
bad breath | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's smoking habit had a negative impact on the first kiss. While smoking can lead to lung disease and persistent cough, these options are unlikely to directly ruin a kiss. Birth defects are also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Bad breath, on the other hand, is a common and immediate consequence of smoking that can be a turnoff during intimacy. Ashtray could also be a possible answer, but bad breath is more directly related to the context of the sentence.
buildings | Knowledge: New York City is known for its iconic skyline and impressive architecture. Many people come to the city specifically to see the tall buildings and famous landmarks such as the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Freedom Tower. The other options do not have any clear connection to what people might be in awe of in New York City.
fashion show | Knowledge: The use of the term "catwalk" and the fact that helmets and harnesses were needed suggest that the context is related to a high-rise runway used in fashion shows, rather than a construction site or a fieldhouse. The term "theatre" could also be a possibility but the use of helmets and harnesses makes it unlikely, as they would not typically be used in a theatrical setting. The inclusion of "mountain" does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
care for patients | Knowledge: The question is asking about how a doctor deals with suffering and death in their patients, which implies a level of empathy and compassion. One possible way for a doctor to cope with this is by providing care for their patients, which can help alleviate their suffering and provide comfort. This answer also aligns with the ethical and professional obligations of a doctor to provide care and support for their patients. The other options do not offer a viable solution or may even be unethical or inappropriate in a medical setting.
write poems | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the writer had a particular interest or passion for nature, but that this interest did not necessarily contribute to their overall reputation or fame as a writer. The choice "write poems" is the most likely answer because nature is a common subject for poetry, and the act of writing poetry is often associated with a personal and emotional connection to the natural world. The other options, such as "advertising company" or "write novels," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the subject of nature.
get dirty | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something happens to the children's clothes after they leave home, which results in them no longer being clean. The most likely scenario is that the children play or engage in some activity that causes their clothes to become dirty. The options "use water," "soap," and "launder" all suggest actions that could be taken to clean the clothes, making them irrelevant to the context of the sentence. "Cry" is not a logical answer as it has no connection to the cleanliness of the clothes.
get arrested | Knowledge: The sentence implies that buying beer for children is illegal and punishable by law. This knowledge eliminates the options of problems, losing money, fighting, and relaxation, as these consequences do not specifically relate to breaking the law in this manner. While it is possible that one could lose money or experience problems as a result of getting arrested, these options are not as directly related to the context of the sentence as getting arrested.
windowsill | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the loose window is causing an issue that requires yearly maintenance or repair. The only option related to the window is the windowsill, which is the ledge at the bottom of the window. It is common for windowsills to require yearly maintenance, such as painting or sealing, especially on older houses where the wood may have deteriorated over time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
yeast | Knowledge: Yeast is a common ingredient used in bread-making to help the dough rise. Yeast is a microorganism that feeds on sugar in the dough and releases carbon dioxide gas, which causes the dough to expand and rise. The other options are not related to the process of making bread rise.
die of cancer | Knowledge: A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the body, which can be either benign or malignant. In the context of the question, the word "might" suggests that the answer is an outcome that is possible but not guaranteed. Cancer is a disease that can arise from the growth of malignant tumors and can potentially be fatal if left untreated. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
michigan | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a state that is shaped like a glove and that you can rent a condominium there. Michigan is commonly referred to as the "glove-shaped state" due to its resemblance to a mitten or glove. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mail | Knowledge: The question is asking how a bank statement, which is a physical document, might arrive at someone's house. The most likely method of delivery for a physical document is through mail, as it is a common delivery service used for sending letters and packages. The other options do not make sense in the context of physical document delivery; a legal document is usually delivered by a courier, a newspaper is delivered by a newspaper carrier, and a press release is distributed via email or online channels.
baggie | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John wanted to keep his food fresh by removing air from around it. The word "suck" implies that John was using some sort of suction device to remove the air. Additionally, the phrase "leaving empty space inside" implies that the item had a cavity that could be filled with food. A baggie fits all of these criteria and is a common household item used to store food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
aloft | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the balloons were up in the air without any visible support. The word "aloft" means up in the air or high above the ground, so it makes sense in the context of the sentence. The other options may also indicate a position higher than the observer, but they do not specifically refer to being in the air or floating.
die | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to the concept of death, which is the cessation of life. The other options, such as trying to stay happy or experiencing, do not make sense in the context of someone who is no longer alive. "Seeing" and "expire" could potentially refer to death in certain contexts, but "die" is the most commonly used and straightforward term.
wash dishes | Knowledge: A dirty kitchen implies that there are dishes that need to be cleaned. Cooking dinner and cooking food are not necessarily related to the cleanliness of the kitchen, and thanking god or mopping may not be a typical response to a dirty kitchen. Therefore, washing dishes is the best answer.
football stadium | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a "big match" which suggests a sporting event. The context of the sentence also implies that the event took place in a large venue that requires tickets. The only option that matches these conditions is "football stadium," which is a common location for large-scale sporting events that require ticketing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
killing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is in the act of killing someone else, and that they may look around and realize the consequences of their actions. Of the options provided, "killing" is the only one that accurately reflects this meaning. "Bleeding" and "knife" are more closely related to the act of stabbing itself, while "gruesome" and "mess" describe the aftermath rather than the act itself.
being ahead | Knowledge: The phrase "reaching advantage" suggests that one racer has gained an advantage over the others, which typically means that they are "ahead" in the race. While "victory" and "winning prize" may be possible outcomes if the racer maintains their advantage until the end of the race, the most immediate result is that they will be "ahead" of the other racers. "New option" and "fall" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
tornadoes | Knowledge: The term "hurricane" refers to a severe tropical storm with strong winds, heavy rain, and a rotating circulation pattern. Tornadoes, on the other hand, are a type of localized wind event that can be just as destructive as hurricanes. They are characterized by a narrow, rapidly rotating column of air that can cause significant damage to buildings and other structures. While some of the other options may be associated with hurricanes, such as "disaster" and "death," they do not have the same direct relationship as "tornadoes."
obscure | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Joe put clear tape on his glasses to prevent something from happening to his field of vision. The word "obscure" means to obstruct or make something unclear, and is commonly used when referring to vision. Therefore, it is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
fishing boat | Knowledge: The mention of a net in the sentence suggests that the person is likely involved in fishing. While a soccer game may involve a net, it is not common for a person to be standing next to it. Fishing gear and a fisherman's boat could also have a net, but the specific wording of "standing next to" suggests that the person is on the same level as the net, which is more likely to be found on a fishing boat. The ocean alone does not provide enough context to determine if there is a net and a person standing next to it.
hitting the jackpot | Knowledge: The phrase "cashing in" implies that the person is making a lot of money from a certain situation. The mention of a judge ruling suggests that this person was likely involved in a lawsuit or settlement following an accident. The phrase "hitting the jackpot" is commonly used in relation to winning a large amount of money, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence.
mall | Knowledge: The keyword in the question is "many types of goods." A mall is typically a large shopping center that houses a wide variety of stores and often includes specialty shops, department stores, and small boutiques. A supermarket typically focuses on groceries, while a grocery store may have a limited selection of other products. A shop is a general term that could refer to a small retail establishment, but it may not necessarily have a wide selection of goods. Therefore, the mall is the best choice for finding many types of goods.
building | Knowledge: A large door is usually associated with a building, as buildings typically have an entrance that requires a large door for people to enter and exit. A van is a vehicle that has smaller sliding doors, usually on the side or back. An apartment may have a standard-sized door for entry, but it is unlikely to have a large one. The neighbor's house may have a large door, but it is not a general rule. A wall does not have a door at all.
toy box | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James plays with a ball as a toy. His mother finds it and puts it somewhere he can easily find it. A likely place for her to put it would be in a container specifically designated for toys, such as a toy box. The other options do not provide a clear connection to where a ball, or any toy, might be stored.
deny | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was not allowed to enter, and the word "unfortunately" implies that it was a negative outcome for them. From the choices, "deny" is the only option that fits this context. "Forbid" and "reject" imply a deliberate action, whereas "deny" suggests a refusal or rejection of a request or entry. "Permitted" does not fit with the idea of only allowing one more in, as it suggests permission to enter.
sadness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy enjoyed answering questions and implies that he was likely interacting with other people while doing so. When "all of the questioners went home," it suggests that the interaction has ended and Billy may feel a sense of loss or loneliness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
construct | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did something intentional in order to ruin the parade, which implies that he planned and executed his plan. The verb "construct" is the most fitting choice among the options, as it conveys the idea of building or making something deliberately. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
desert | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the excavation workers are in a location where staying hydrated is particularly important. This is typical of desert environments, where high temperatures and low humidity can cause rapid dehydration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
laboratory | Knowledge: The word "researcher" implies a person doing scientific research. The phrase "cut his hand" suggests the researcher was likely working with sharp instruments or chemicals. The word "sink" suggests a place where one can wash hands or equipment, which is usually found in a laboratory setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
cool drink | Knowledge: Ice is commonly used to cool drinks and food. It absorbs heat from the surrounding environment and melts, which cools the drink or food. Ice can also be used to cool water, but it is not the most common use. It can harm humans if they slip and fall on it, but that is not its typical function. Ice forms crystals as it freezes, but this is not its main purpose.
vomit | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person got drunk to the point of losing control and "making a mess" with their own liquids, which often refers to vomit. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not involve liquids or making a mess.
freezer or refrigerator | Knowledge: Pies are perishable items that require storage in order to maintain their quality and freshness. Freezing or refrigerating the pie are common options for storage, as this helps to slow down the growth of bacteria and prevents the pie from going bad. Keeping the pie outside or on a windowsill is not recommended, as this can cause the pie to spoil quickly due to exposure to heat and humidity. Similarly, storing the pie in an oven is not appropriate, as this will not keep the pie at the proper temperature for preservation.
car | Knowledge: A parking lot is a designated area for parking cars, so the most obvious and relevant answer is "car." The other choices do not fit the context of the question as they are not typically found in a parking lot. A town, city, or business district may have parking lots, but they cannot be put inside the lot. A circus may perform in a parking lot, but it is not a common item found within it.
listen to music | Knowledge: Festivals are often associated with musical performances, concerts and live music, making it a popular activity for attendees to enjoy. While some festivals may offer games or activities, the option "play games" is not as commonly associated with festivals as the other options. Talking and hearing birds' voices are also not activities typically associated with festivals, while eating ice cream may be a popular food choice at festivals, it is not the primary activity that people go for.
bookstore | Knowledge: The phrase "endless shelves" suggests a large collection of items, which is commonly associated with bookstores. Bookstores often have numerous shelves containing a wide variety of books, making it likely that one would find endless shelves there. The other options do not have a clear connection to the phrase "endless shelves."
mississippi | Knowledge: The sentence provides specific details about the location of the person, stating that they were an hour away from Jackson after heading east on the de Soto bridge. Jackson is the capital city of Mississippi, which means that the person must have been in Mississippi at the time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
mist | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the temperature was low enough to create a visible condensation of breath when exhaling. This is a common phenomenon that occurs when the air is cool and humid enough to cause the water vapor in our breath to condense into visible droplets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
enable | Knowledge: The sentence implies that computers played a crucial role in John's work, but they had to do one specific thing to be of use. The word "useless" suggests that if the computers couldn't perform this function, they were no good for John's work. The word "enable" fits this context because it means to make something possible or functional. The other options are not as fitting because they either do not directly connect to computers or do not describe the specific function that John needed the computers to perform.
furniture | Knowledge: The question is asking about the placement of a bed in a new house, which implies that the bed is a part of the furniture that will be used inside the house. It would not make sense to place a bed in the garage or on the floor, as these are not suitable places for sleeping. "Sleep" and "awake" are not choices that relate to the physical placement of a bed in a space. Therefore, "furniture" is the most logical answer.
None of the above | Knowledge: The sentence does not provide any clear context or information to suggest what people might do when finding a good deal. As such, all the choices are inappropriate and do not relate to the question. It is crucial to read and understand the context of the sentence before attempting to answer a question.
web | Knowledge: Spiders are known for building webs to catch their prey. Webs are intricate structures made of silk that spiders produce from their bodies. Webs are commonly found in corners of rooms, in trees, or on plants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
city | Knowledge: A beauty parlor is a type of establishment where people go to receive beauty treatments such as hair styling, manicures, and facials. These types of establishments are commonly located in urban areas with a high concentration of residents and foot traffic. The choice "city" makes the most sense because it is the most likely location for a beauty parlor to be found. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
die | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy was contemplating suicide but was not considering the consequences. The most severe consequence of suicide is death, which aligns with the option "die." The other options do not describe a likely outcome of suicide, and some options like "sitting down" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
pharmacy | Knowledge: Birth control pills are a prescription medication that must be obtained from a pharmacy. Drug stores may carry over-the-counter contraceptives such as condoms or spermicide, but not prescription medication. Medicine cabinets are where a person may store their own medication, but birth control pills cannot be obtained this way. Hormones may be used in medical treatments but do not refer specifically to birth control pills. Vagina is a body part and not a location for obtaining medication.
All of the choices could be correct, as "rambunctious" generally means energetic and rowdy behavior. However, it is worth noting that "throw things" could be the most likely option, as throwing objects is a common example of rambunctious behavior in children.
sunshine | Knowledge: Grapes need plenty of sunlight to ripen and grow successfully, which is essential for vineyards to produce good-quality grapes. Deserts, shops, kitchen, and terrain do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
bar | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dumb kid tried to use his student ID as proof of age to get into a place where he should be of legal age, which typically means a bar. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
food market | Knowledge: A food market is a place where various ingredients, including potatoes, are typically available for purchase. A pantry is a storage space within a home, and while it may contain ingredients, it's unlikely to have fresh produce like a potato. A farmer's field and soil are where potatoes grow, but it's not practical to obtain a single potato from a field, and it may not be feasible to dig one up from soil. A cellar is a storage space, similar to a pantry, and it may contain ingredients, but it's not a common place to purchase them.
call reinforcements | Knowledge: The phrase "get the upper hand" suggests that the opponents have gained an advantage in the battle. In such a situation, soldiers may need to call for backup, or reinforcements, to help them turn the tide of the battle. Following orders and using weapons are actions that soldiers would typically take in any battle situation but do not specifically address what happens when opponents gain the upper hand. Coming home and dying in battle are not actions that soldiers can take in the middle of a battle.
closet | Knowledge: A dress shirt is typically kept in a closet or wardrobe, which is a space specifically designed for storing clothing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A garderobe is a historical term for a toilet or privy, a drawer is too small for storing a dress shirt, a suitcase is for travel and not for daily use, and "absence heat" is not a recognizable phrase.
television | Knowledge: The sentence specifically mentions that the programs will be seen by millions of people. The options "group functions," "conference," and "theater" suggest a limited audience size, whereas "compute" is not a relevant option. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "television," which has the potential to reach a vast audience.
keg | Knowledge: A keg is a common container used to hold large quantities of beer at bars, parties, or events. It is specifically designed for storage and dispensing of beer, often holding anywhere from 5-15 gallons of beer at a time. The other options are not related to the context of storing beer in large quantities.
rain forest | Knowledge: The context clues suggest that the monkey's home was a rain forest, as the plants and trees were mentioned as being familiar to him. The other options, such as treetops, tundra, playful mood, and Brazil, do not fit with the description of the monkey's habitat.
car rental shop | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John ordered tickets online and got into his car, indicating that he will be driving to his destination. None of the other options involve driving or going across the country, making car rental shop the most likely choice.
None of the choices are correct. | Knowledge: The sentence does not provide any clear indication of what the man's name might be, so none of the options are correct. The fact that the woman calls herself "the Joy" may suggest that she has a cheerful personality or that she is known for bringing happiness to others, but it does not provide any clues about her husband's name.
large building | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the building is spacious enough to accommodate a significant number of people, and the entrance hall is wide enough to admit a hundred people shoulder to shoulder. This implies that the building is not a small or medium-sized one, but rather a large building. Additionally, it also mentions that the building belongs to a billionaire and is used only for personal entertainment, which implies that it is not a public building or convention center. School and town hall are also not applicable as they have specific purposes and are usually used by the community rather than being privately owned.
museum | Knowledge: Dinosaur bones are typically found in fossils, which are preserved remains of ancient organisms. These fossils can be found in various locations, but the most common place to see them on display is in a museum. Museums often have collections of fossils and dinosaur bones that have been excavated from around the world. The other options, such as the human body, arm, tomb or pyramid, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
building | Knowledge: A garage is a structure used to store cars and other vehicles. It is not typically considered a home, though it may be a part of one. It is also not located downtown, as it is typically situated at or near a residence. While it is primarily used for storage, it is not exclusively a storage area, as it may also be used for other purposes such as working on cars. The most appropriate choice is therefore "building," as a garage is a specific kind of structure.
large house | Knowledge: The use of the term "back courtyard" suggests a residential setting, and the mention of a walkout basement implies a multi-story structure. The terms "suburbs" and "farm house" also suggest a residential setting, but do not provide any specific indication of the size or layout of the property. "Palace" and "country estate" suggest a larger and more grandiose setting, but are not necessarily associated with walkout basements or back courtyards. Therefore, "large house" is the most appropriate choice.
play ball | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that young people are looking for a recreational activity to do when they are bored. "Play ball" is a common phrase used to refer to playing sports, which is a common activity done for recreation. The other options, such as "choose life" and "write programs," do not seem like viable recreational activities for a bored young person.
atlas | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is lost and in need of direction, so they should consult something that can provide them with a map or guide. One option is an atlas, which is a collection of maps and geographical information. An atlas can help the speaker locate their current location and plan a route to their destination. The other options do not provide the same kind of navigational support as an atlas.
friend's house | Knowledge: The question implies that the monkey is a pet and could have possibly wandered off to a familiar place nearby. Since the options include locations that are far from a typical household, it can be assumed that the answer is the closest and most logical option, which is a friend's house. The other options are geographically distant and do not make sense in the context of the question.
keep people out | Knowledge: Closing a door is often done to prevent access to a space or room, and to keep people or animals out. This is especially important for privacy and security reasons. The other options do not necessarily require the act of closing a door, such as preventing wind (which could be done with a window), enclosing a cupboard (which could have a door that stays open), or dealing with glass (which is not related to the act of closing a door).
hallway | Knowledge: The question asks about the floor between rooms, which likely refers to the hallway. Hallways are typically the spaces that connect different rooms in a building, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Carpet is a type of flooring material, exchange refers to the act of trading or swapping, dance is a type of activity, and building refers to the structure itself, none of which directly relate to the question.
trunk | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lily bought some new clothing and put it in her car. Since she didn't take it home (house) or put it away in a drawer or closet, she may have taken it somewhere else. Putting items in the trunk of a car is a common way to transport items from one place to another, especially when they are too large or numerous to carry by hand. The yard sale option is unlikely since Lily just bought the clothing and wouldn't be selling it at a yard sale.
stadium | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the locker rooms being referred to are located in a facility that attracts the attention of the press, suggesting a professional or high-level sports setting. The options "jocks," "health club," and "gymnasium" may have locker rooms but are not necessarily venues with significant media coverage. "Hatred" is an unrelated choice. Therefore, the correct answer is "stadium," a place where major sporting events are held and where reporters frequent the locker rooms to conduct interviews and gather news.
sit down | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans like to be seated while engaging in artistic expression, which implies that they invented something to facilitate this behavior. Out of the choices given, only "sit down" makes sense as it is an action that enables a person to be seated. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
science | Knowledge: The sentence implies that John does not see any contradiction or opposition between religion and science. This may suggest that John believes that religious beliefs and scientific ideas can coexist peacefully without conflicting with each other. The other options, such as wars or atheism, are not related to the idea of a lack of conflict between religion and something else.
arguments | Knowledge: The question suggests that when planning a vacation, couples may sometimes disagree, leading to potential conflict. The option "arguments" reflects this possibility. The other options do not necessarily follow from the premise of the question, as the couple may still be able to relax, enjoy, go abroad, or spend money even if they disagree about the details of the vacation.
speak | Knowledge: The sentence is referring to addressing a group of people, which is typically done through speaking. Hand signals may be used to emphasize or clarify a point, but they are not a primary method of communication when addressing a group. Shouting, yelling, and earthquakes are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
expect to die | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that because we are not immortal (i.e. we will eventually die), there is something that people should do. This implies that the answer is related to life and death. Out of the given choices, only "expect to die" fits this context. The other choices do not relate to the topic of mortality and have no clear connection to the sentence.
airport | Knowledge: Travelers who are planning to go to a different continent are most likely to be found at an airport, as this is the main transportation hub for long-distance international travel. Rest areas, bus depots, and train stations are typically used for shorter distance travel within a particular region or country. "Book tickets" is also a misleading option as it only refers to the act of buying tickets and does not provide any context about where travelers would gather.
liquor store | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific location where one can find both beer and wine, and the most common place to find both of these beverages together is at a liquor store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
produce sound | Knowledge: The term "audio card" refers to a type of hardware component that allows a computer to produce sound. Therefore, it can be inferred that computers with audio cards are capable of producing sound. The other options may or may not be true, but they are not directly related to the function of an audio card.
computer store | Knowledge: The word "system" suggests that the item being referred to is likely to be a technological or mechanical device. The fact that it is described as "complex" implies that it is not a simple or common item that can be easily found in a regular retail store. This narrows down the options to a computer store or a place that specializes in selling complex machinery or equipment. However, since the options are limited and the word "computer" is mentioned in one of the choices, it is safe to assume that the correct answer is "computer store". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
women | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a group of people in the office filed a complaint against the man, which implies that the man's behavior was directed at a specific group. The use of the word "crass" and "rude" further suggests that the man's behavior may have been disrespectful or offensive. Therefore, the most likely group of people to file a complaint would be women, as they are commonly targeted by sexist behavior in the workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
in wall | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to places within a house where spiders are commonly found. Spiders are known to create webs, so the option "web" could also be a possibility, but the question is asking for the location rather than the creation. Spiders also tend to hide in dark and cluttered areas, which would make options like "cellar" and "basement" plausible as well. However, the option "in wall" is the most likely answer as spiders can often be found in the cracks and crevices of walls where they can hide and build their webs.
good relationship | Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the person is looking for something that can be found on a dating website. Financial security, quick marriage, and owning a house do not necessarily have to do with dating, while "live well" is a vague term that could mean many things. "Good relationship" is the only option that directly relates to the purpose of a dating website.
poisonous gas | Knowledge: The question is asking about a cause of mass death, which suggests a large-scale event or tragedy. The choices of homicide and suicide both refer to individual acts and are not likely to result in mass death. Poison leaves may cause harm to individuals who ingest them, but they would not cause mass death. Nuclear weapons are extremely destructive, but their use is relatively rare and the question does not specify a war or conflict scenario. Poisonous gas, however, is a well-known cause of mass death in certain contexts, such as chemical attacks or accidents involving hazardous chemicals.
share things | Knowledge: The term collectivist refers to a cultural or social system where individuals prioritize the goals and needs of their community or group over their own individual goals and needs. Sharing things is a common behavior in collectivist cultures because it supports the idea of working together for the common good of the group. The other options do not have a clear association with collectivism.
surface of earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scope of flowers Lilly hopes to see is vast and encompasses all types of flowers. The other options are more specific and not as broad as the surface of the earth, which includes all types of environments where flowers may exist. The Netherlands, countryside, state park, and anthology are all limited subsets of the surface of the earth and do not encompass all types of flowers.
college campus | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the student is a college student who enjoys playing tennis on campus. Recreational centers and athletic clubs are commonly associated with local community centers or private facilities, and soccer fields do not typically have tennis courts. The options "town" and "college campus" both seem plausible, but the mention of the student as a "student" implies that the correct answer is "college campus."
hot | Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific time when food is never cold. The term "hot" is commonly used to describe food that has been heated to a high temperature, and is therefore not cold. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
eat healthily | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being overweight is unhealthy, which can be improved by exercise and a healthy diet. The option to "eat healthily" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to the topic of weight and health. Options like "run faster" and "look better" are not relevant because they do not address the issue of health directly. "Stay fit" and "get in shape" are close, but they do not clearly explain how one can achieve those fitness goals, while "eat healthily" does.
Feeling better | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James listens to something after a hard day and along with a cool bath. This suggests that the activity helps him relax and feel better. The options "ardor," "amusement," and "enlightenment" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. "Fall asleep" could be a possibility, but the sentence only suggests that listening to something helps James feel better, not that it necessarily puts him to sleep.
sleep soundly | Knowledge: The sentence mentions a stressed out mother, which suggests that the baby's behavior is related to calming the mother down. Of the choices provided, sleep soundly is the only option that implies a quiet and peaceful behavior, which is likely to soothe a stressed out mother. Laughing, giggling, and clapping hands may be cute, but they are also likely to be noisy and may not produce the desired effect. Liking spinach is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
beach | Knowledge: Driftwood is typically found washed up on beaches after being carried there by currents or waves. While it can also be found in oceans and seas, the context of the question suggests that the answer is more likely to be related to an area where people can physically access large quantities of driftwood, which is more commonly found on beaches. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
soccer game | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that black and white balls are being kicked with feet, which is a common activity in soccer. Soccer is a sport that involves using one's feet to control a ball and score goals, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
seasickness | Knowledge: Traveling on the water can cause a sense of motion that can lead to seasickness, which is a common side effect of being on a boat, ship, or other watercraft. Motion sickness is a related condition that can also occur when the body senses movement but the eyes cannot detect it, such as when traveling in a car. Jet lag is a condition caused by crossing time zones and can cause fatigue and disrupted sleep patterns. Diarrhea is not typically associated with traveling on the water but can be a common issue while traveling in areas with different food or water sources. Fatigue is a general feeling of tiredness that can be caused by a variety of factors but is not specific to traveling on the water.
conference | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person attends an event on a yearly basis to review the available programs. The term "conference" typically refers to a gathering of professionals or experts in a specific field, where they discuss and present their research or ideas. The other options, such as think tank, group functions, theater, and television, do not necessarily have the same connotation of an organized event with a specific focus on programs or offerings.
new jersey | Knowledge: In the United States, tolls are commonly found on highways and bridges in certain states such as New Jersey. They are less common in cities and on interstate highways. England and Europe also have toll roads, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that the motorway mentioned is located in either of these places.
unemployed | Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is related to employment or job status. Being unemployed means that a person does not have a job or is not currently employed. The other options - do nothing, play, celebrate, and laziness - are not directly related to employment status and do not provide a suitable answer for the question.
anywhere on earth | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human is in orbit around their home planet, which means they would have a view of the entire planet from above. The option "anywhere on earth" is the only one that fits this context, as the other options are either unrelated or specific locations within space or on Earth.
being lively | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is speaking a lot and is energetic, which can be described as being lively. The other options, such as "speaking from mouth" and "voice" are not accurate descriptions of someone who is talking a lot and being lively. "Blabbering" is a negative connotation and doesn't necessarily imply that the person is being lively. "Speech" is a noun and doesn't accurately describe the behavior or attitude of the person who is talking.
street | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John cut his feet on broken glass while walking, which is more likely to occur on a hard surface like a street rather than softer surfaces like a landfill, field or beach. Trash is also unlikely to be the location as broken glass would not typically be found scattered on the ground in a trash area.
obesity | Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the doctors warned the person about their eating habits, which suggests a potential health issue. The options "gain weight," "getting fit," and "gas" do not necessarily suggest a health problem. "Getting sick" is too general, and could refer to any number of conditions, while "obesity" specifically relates to a condition caused by excessive weight gain.
farts | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something may happen after eating lunch that affects other people. Farting is a common bodily function that may disrupt others around you, whereas gaining weight, feeling jealous, or experiencing heartburn or bad breath do not necessarily have an immediate or direct impact on others.
think and reason | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the robot has limitations when it comes to processing new or unfamiliar situations. "Thinking and reasoning" is an ability that is closely associated with the human brain and is often cited as a defining characteristic of human intelligence. The other options ("torture," "be clear," "think critically," and "have fever") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
aids | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there was a negative consequence associated with having sex as a gay man twenty years ago. During the 1980s and 1990s, AIDS was a major health crisis among gay men, and unprotected sex could lead to the transmission of the disease. While some of the other options may be tangentially related to the topic of sex, only AIDS directly fits the context of the sentence.
throw up | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that drinking too much alcohol too quickly can lead to a bodily reaction of expelling the alcohol, commonly known as vomiting or throwing up. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
legs | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing tennis involves a lot of lateral movement, which would require the use of leg muscles. Additionally, the phrase "great workout" implies that physical exercise is involved, which would further support the idea that the answer is "legs." The other options do not seem to be directly related to the context of the sentence - "skill" and "competition" may be important aspects of playing tennis, but they do not necessarily relate to the physical demands of the sport.
sun itself  | Knowledge: Since the sentence describes a cold snake in a cage, it can be inferred that the snake is trying to warm itself up. The choice "sun itself" makes the most sense, as snakes are known to bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature. The other options, such as "pet" or "rude", do not provide any logical connection to the situation described. "Tropical forest" or "tree" could be possible answers if the context suggested that the snake was trying to escape or find shelter in a natural habitat, which is not the case in this sentence.
lie back | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John found something to be relaxing, and the phrase "lie back" is commonly associated with relaxation. The other options may also have some connection to relaxation, but none of them are directly mentioned in the sentence. Feeling better, lower blood pressure, and feeling happy may all be benefits of relaxation, but they are not the action itself. Falling asleep may be a form of relaxation, but it is not the action that is being described in the sentence.
park | Knowledge: Parks are commonly associated with peacefulness and relaxation. They often offer natural scenery and environments that can help people to unwind from the stresses of everyday life. Choices such as jail, train station, and workplace are typically associated with stress and tension, while churches may offer spiritual comfort but may not necessarily provide the same sense of tranquility as a park.
garage | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is surrounded by tools and oil cans, which are commonly found in garages. Garages are spaces where people usually store and work on vehicles or other machinery, so it makes sense that the person would be found in a garage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
careless driving | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police officer pulled over the car because of the way it was being driven. The phrase "careless driving" indicates that the driver was not paying enough attention to the road, which could be due to a variety of careless behaviors. The other options "going too fast", "go fast", and "start running" all suggest that the car was driving at high speeds, which is not necessarily the reason for the pull over. The phrase "last several years" does not make any sense in the context of the sentence.
entertaining | Knowledge: The sentence states that people watch movies to "escape for a couple hours," suggesting that they find them enjoyable or entertaining. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Theatres are a place where movies are watched but are not inherently enjoyable, funny is a specific type of movie genre and does not apply to all movies, watched on videos is not related to the context of the sentence, and excellent is a subjective term that does not necessarily imply enjoyment.
room | Knowledge: A satchel is a type of bag or container typically used for carrying books or other personal items. It is most likely to be stored in a room, such as a bedroom or study, where it can be easily accessed and kept safe. A desk may also be a possible location for storing a satchel, particularly if it is used for work or studying. The other options, such as a clothing store, school or luggage compartment, are less likely to be the appropriate place for storing a satchel.
hematite | Knowledge: Hematite is an iron oxide mineral that is often found in different geological formations. It is common for hematite to have varying levels of iron within its structure, which can result in some areas of it having iron, while other areas do not. The other options, such as linen closets, houses, laundry rooms, and chemistry labs, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
get | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking what someone wants to do when they love something, which typically involves acquiring or obtaining it. "Get" is the most appropriate option among the choices because it refers to the act of obtaining something. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or have negative connotations.
ignoring | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lud was not giving John any attention or acknowledgement, which aligns with the definition of ignoring. Befriending means to make friends with, disparagement means criticism or belittlement, dishonor means loss of respect or reputation, and contumely means insulting language or treatment - none of which fit the context of the sentence.
asia | Knowledge: Walls with historical significance are commonly associated with Asia, specifically the Great Wall of China. This wall is a well-known and iconic landmark in China and is often associated with the country's history and culture. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
acceptance | Knowledge: The first part of the sentence indicates that there is resistance to change in the society, which implies that the new ways are not immediately accepted. However, the second part of the sentence suggests that over time, these new ways gradually gain acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer is acceptance. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence.
hurry home | Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone remembered that they left their oven turned on and the most logical option would be to hurry home to turn it off. It is unlikely that people would jump to conclusions, build trust, or learn from each other in this situation, so these options can be eliminated. "Talk to each other" is also unlikely to be the correct answer as the situation is not one that requires communication with others.
drug store | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the store specializes in prescriptions, which implies that it is a drug store. The sentence also suggests that the store charges higher prices for most other goods, which might deter customers from buying non-essential items there. Therefore, buying a hair dryer at this store would likely be convenient but more expensive. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
ante | Knowledge: The absence of blinds in a poker game indicates that the players have to make a mandatory bet to participate in the game, which is called an ante. The sentence suggests that the players started playing despite the absence of blinds, which means that they must have used an alternate method of initiating the game, which is most likely the ante. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Kentucky | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a state north of Alabama is known for having many beavers. Kentucky is located directly north of Alabama and is home to a diverse range of habitats that support beaver populations, including rivers, streams, and wetlands. Beaverton is a city in Oregon, Canada is a country located north of the United States, Montana is located in the northwest region of the US, and "river or stream" is not a state name.
hospital | Knowledge: The question suggests that the use of a laser is intended to alleviate suffering, which is a common medical application of lasers. The options "nasa" and "CD players" are unrelated to medical practices, and "laboratory" could refer to any number of scientific fields. "Ophthalmologist's office" is a medical setting, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that a laser would be used to alleviate suffering in that particular context. "Hospital" is the most logical choice, as it is a medical facility where patients receive treatment for a range of illnesses and injuries.
cost money | Knowledge: The question asks for a reason why some people choose to not own cars. One possible reason is that cars can be expensive to own and maintain, which makes them a financial burden for some people. The other options do not address the financial aspect of owning a car and, therefore, are not relevant to the question.
sing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person would play their favorite music during their monotonous commute to work. It then goes on to suggest that they would "just ____ along with it." Speeding or headbanging do not fit the context of this sentence and are not a common activity during a daily commute. Listening to the radio or music are also possibilities, but the sentence includes the word "just" which implies that the person was doing something in addition to listening to music. The most plausible answer is singing along with the music they were playing.
euphoria | Knowledge: The description of Lilly running her hands over John's body, being kissed, feeling every nerve tingle, and nothing ever feeling so right suggests that she is experiencing intense pleasure and euphoria. The other options, such as stroke, increase of temperature, and get hot, do not fit the context of the sentence and do not accurately describe Lilly's experience.
none of the above (jellyfish are cold-blooded and do not regulate their body temperature) | Knowledge: Jellyfish are cold-blooded and do not generate their own body heat, so they do not actively seek warmth. They are found in many oceanic regions, including the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, but the location does not necessarily impact their body temperature. Bikini Bottom and Japanese restaurant are fictional or human-made locations and have no relation to the natural habitat or behavior of jellyfish. The option "store" is also irrelevant as jellyfish are not commonly kept as pets or sold in stores.
round | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the difficulty in predicting a rebound in basketball is due to some characteristic of the ball or rim. The options "dribbling," "bouncing around court," and "full of air" do not refer to a characteristic of the ball or rim that would make it difficult to predict a rebound. The option "punctured" would make the ball behave in an unpredictable way, but this is not the reason why rebounds are difficult to predict. The option "round" makes sense because a round ball and rim can produce unpredictable bounces and rebounds.
woodlands | Knowledge: Beavers are often associated with their role in building dams and lodges in wooded areas near bodies of water, such as rivers and ponds. This suggests that the beaver in the sentence is likely to be in a similar setting, such as a wooded area, rather than in a specific country or state. Therefore, the correct answer is "woodlands", while the other choices can be eliminated based on their lack of relevance to the context of the sentence.
concert | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a musical program happening tonight, and one of the groups listed will serve as the cover for that program. "Opera" and "symphonic" refer to specific types of music rather than groups that would perform at a program. "Television" and "computer" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Concert" is the most likely choice, as it refers to a performance by a group of musicians and is often used as a synonym for "musical program."
furniture store | Knowledge: A dining room table is a piece of furniture commonly found in a furniture store, along with other types of furniture such as sofas, chairs, and beds. The other options, such as house, rug, and shoe store, do not offer dining room tables. Home is a more general term and can refer to any physical dwelling, so it does not specifically indicate where to get a dining room table.
lazy | Knowledge: The question is asking for a secondary result of being tired, which implies that being tired is the primary cause of something else happening. One possible outcome of feeling tired is that a person may become lazy or unmotivated to do things. This is supported by the fact that tiredness can cause physical and mental fatigue, which can make it harder to focus and be productive. The other options in the list do not have a clear connection to the idea of being tired as a primary cause.
disagreements | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is experiencing financial issues, which implies a lack of financial resources. Therefore, buying products could create disagreements between the couple since they may have different ideas about what is essential to buy and what is not. The other options do not adequately reflect the context of the sentence.
repair | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object in question was damaged but not completely destroyed. In such a case, repairing the damage would be a logical next step. Demolishing the object, creating a new one, or constructing something new would not be appropriate actions to take if the object is still salvageable. "Fix" and "repair" are essentially synonymous in this context, but "repair" may sound more appropriate in this instance because it suggests fixing something that was broken or damaged.
encampment | Knowledge: The word "encampment" suggests a temporary living situation, such as a campground or military base. It would be highly unusual to put a furnace in such a situation because it would be a waste of resources and materials to heat a temporary living space with a permanent heating system. The other options all suggest permanent living situations where a furnace is a common and necessary source of heat.
notebook | Knowledge: Ring binders are typically used for organization and storage of papers, notes, and documents. Notebooks are a common item to be stored in a ring binder for easy access and organization. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of storing items in a ring binder.
cleanliness | Knowledge: The word "grooming" typically refers to the act of cleaning oneself or maintaining one's appearance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the answer choice that relates to cleanliness is the correct one. The other choices - mistakes, errors, neatness, and beauty - are either unrelated or do not fully capture the meaning of grooming.
trash | Knowledge: Junk mail is typically considered to be unwanted or unnecessary, and therefore should be disposed of in a way that does not require attention or effort. Putting it in a basket, desk, or mail box would not effectively dispose of it, and would likely lead to clutter and confusion. A waste bin or trash can is the most appropriate place to discard junk mail.
motel | Knowledge: The sentence mentions housekeeping, suggesting that Billy is staying in a place where there is a cleaning staff. The description of the place as "cheap" further supports the idea that he is staying in a budget motel, as this type of lodging often does not have daily housekeeping services. The other options, dump, office, park, and corner, do not fit the context provided in the sentence.
prison | Knowledge: The sentence is asking about how to make a proper sentence, which is related to language and grammar. The options "incorrect", "incomplete", and "inappropriate" all relate to grammar and language use, while "impolite" relates to etiquette and social norms in communication. "Prison" does not have any connection to the topic at hand and can be eliminated as the correct answer.
take breath | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject held their breath after performing a certain activity. The correct answer must therefore indicate the action of taking a breath, not exhaling or other breathing-related activities. "Inhale" and "inhaling" both suggest the act of breathing in, rather than holding one's breath. "Wheeze" suggests strained breathing or difficulty breathing, which is not indicated in the sentence. "Meditate" is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, "take breath" is the best option.
rhode island | Knowledge: The sentence states that the apple tree was purchased to be planted near Providence, which is located in Rhode Island. Therefore, the correct answer is Rhode Island. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
agitation | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has cut in front of you while you were waiting in line all day, which is likely to cause a negative emotional response. Agitation is a feeling of annoyance or irritation, which is a common reaction to someone cutting in line. Fainting, hunger, boredom, and pain are not likely to be a result of someone cutting in front of you in line.
flea market | Knowledge: The fact that the plate is described as an antique suggests that it is old and possibly no longer in production, making it less likely to be found in a modern store or kitchen cupboard. The options of dishwasher and restaurant also do not make sense as places to buy an antique plate. The most likely option is flea market, as these types of markets are known for selling a variety of vintage and antique items.
stone age | Knowledge: The question refers to the idea of humans and mammoths meeting, which implies a time when both species existed. The Stone Age is a period of prehistory known for the development of tools and weapons made from stone, and it is also a time when mammoths roamed the Earth alongside early humans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
intoxication | Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a synonym for getting drunk, so we need to look at the options that are related to alcohol consumption. Intoxication is a common term used to describe the state of being drunk or under the influence of alcohol. Blazed and being sick do not necessarily refer to getting drunk specifically, while vomiting and hangover are related to the symptoms and aftermath of alcohol consumption rather than the act of drinking itself.
go outside | Knowledge: Dogs typically relieve themselves outside, so the most logical answer would be "go outside." The other choices do not make sense in the context of where a dog would go to pee.
gas station | Knowledge: Rest areas and gas stations are typically found along highways and are designed for travelers to take a break and use the restroom. Libraries and office buildings may not have public restrooms available, and restaurants may require you to make a purchase before using their facilities. Therefore, the best choice for finding a restroom while on the road is a gas station.
city council meeting | Knowledge: A city council is a committee made up of elected officials who govern a particular city. City councils typically hold public meetings that members of the public can attend to hear about city business, ask questions, and provide feedback. The other options, such as a business or office building, do not necessarily involve a committee, and a temple typically does not have public meetings. A boardroom could involve a committee, but it is not specifically related to the context of the question.
happiness | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is enjoying their time while chatting with friends. Happiness is often associated with positive emotions and a feeling of contentment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options do not necessarily relate to the idea of having a good time or chatting with friends.
nonstandard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tool had a standard sizing, implying that the bolt did not match this standard size. The word "fit" reinforces this idea, as it implies that the two objects did not match up properly. Knowing the definitions of the other options can also help eliminate them as possible answers - "informal" and "colloquial" relate to language use, not tools and bolts, while "standard wing" and "stanine" are not commonly used terms in this context.
bus station | Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a location where you can land, claim your things, and continue your journey by bus. The most logical option would be a bus station, as it is a place specifically designed for these kinds of transfers. While the other options may have bus stops, they do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
palace | Knowledge: The use of the word "king" suggests a place of royalty, such as a palace. The phrase "his back courtyard" also implies that it is a private and enclosed space within the king's residence. The other options do not have the same association with royalty or the idea of a personal courtyard in a private residence.
toy store | Knowledge: The sentence implies that the salesperson had to be good with children, indicating that they likely worked in a setting where they interacted with kids frequently. The most logical option among the choices is a toy store, as this is where children would be more likely to be present and the salesperson would need to engage with them to make sales. The other options do not have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
playground | Knowledge: The sentence implies that a pebble that has been walked on is likely to be found in a location where people frequently walk. Playgrounds are a common place where people walk and play, and it's possible that children might have kicked around or stepped on pebbles while playing. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
being trapped | Knowledge: The sentence states that Brother Mike escaped from a collapsed mine, which suggests that he was in a situation where he was trapped or stuck. Therefore, it makes sense that he would be afraid of being trapped again, and the option "being trapped" aligns with this logic. The other choices do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence, as they imply a different kind of danger or threat.
refrigerator | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Max was looking for onions to cook a stew, which implies that he is most likely going to search in the kitchen or a place where food is stored. Out of the given options, the refrigerator is the most logical choice as it is the common storage for perishable foods like onions. The other options are unlikely places for finding onions for a stew.
atheism | Knowledge: The sentence implies that while religion plays a significant role in many people's lives, there is an aspect of it that is often overly preachy. The choice "atheism" is likely correct as it is the option that is most similar in context to religion, and the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Atheism is often associated with a rejection of religion and a reliance on science or logic, which could explain why it is sometimes seen as preachy or pushy in contrast to religion.
visual | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John believes that television and radio are different, and the answer choice that best explains the difference is "visual." Television provides a visual component that radio does not, as it displays moving images and often incorporates elements such as text and graphics, whereas radio is predominantly audio-based. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of John's statement, and there is no indication that conformity or laziness are related to the differences between television and radio.
roll over | Knowledge: The phrase "take a corner at too high a velocity" suggests that the car is traveling at a high speed and making a turn. When a vehicle takes a turn too quickly, the centripetal force acting on the car can cause it to lose control and roll over. The other options do not accurately describe the consequences of taking a turn at a high velocity.
earnings | Knowledge: Stockholders are interested in the financial health of the company and want to know how well it is performing. One way to measure this is by looking at the earnings, which shows how much profit the company is making. The other options, such as assets, cafeteria, and board of directors, do not provide any relevant information about the company's financial performance.
form opinions | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are presented with controversial information, they tend to take some sort of action. In this case, the answer option "form opinions" is most likely because when people are presented with controversial information, they will likely think critically about it, weigh their options, and come to their own conclusions about the topic. The other answer options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are unlikely responses to hearing something controversial.
school band | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mark was playing an instrument in a group setting for a performance that his parents were watching in a school cafeteria. Out of the choices given, school band is the most likely option for this scenario. An orchestra typically does not perform in a school cafeteria, a brass quartet is a smaller group than a school band, and marching band usually performs outside. School play is not a likely option as it involves acting, not music.
many places | Knowledge: The question is asking where a human in a large northeastern city can find food, and the most logical answer would be "many places" since large cities typically have a variety of options for food, such as restaurants, cafes, food trucks, and grocery stores. The other options (school, new york city, and zoo) are not relevant to the context of the question, and while a store may be a viable answer, it is more limited than "many places."
orgasm | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to the purpose or goal of having sex. While some people may have different motivations or intentions for engaging in sexual activity, the option that most people hope to achieve when having sex is typically an orgasm. This is because an orgasm can provide feelings of pleasure and release, and is often considered the physiological endpoint of sexual activity. The other options are generally undesirable outcomes of having sex.
travel | Knowledge: The question is asking about when people typically go shopping for souvenirs, which are often bought as mementos of a trip or vacation. The choice "travel" is the most relevant option because people most often purchase souvenirs when they are traveling and have the opportunity to visit new or interesting places. The other options ("having money," "money and time," "funeral," and "spending money") do not relate to the context of the question and offer no indication about when people typically buy souvenirs.
hotel | Knowledge: The word "guests" suggests that the salon is located in a place where people are staying temporarily. Out of the options, hotels are the most likely place to have a salon for guests. Additionally, hotels often have amenities like spas and salons to enhance their guests' experiences. The other options are less likely to have a specialty hair salon for guests.
forest canopy | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that a sloth climbs slowly but can eventually reach a high point. The options "forest canopy," "large trees," and "tropical rainforest" are all related to trees, which sloths are known to climb. "Nature preserve" doesn't provide any insight into where a sloth can climb, and "universe" is clearly unrelated to the context of the sentence.
become educated | Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to someone when they are learning about science. The correct answer should reflect a positive outcome, as learning about science is typically seen as a valuable and exciting pursuit. The option "loss of interest" is unlikely to be correct because it suggests a negative outcome, which is not typical when someone is learning about science. The option "excitement" is a likely correct answer because it reflects an outcome that many people experience when learning about science. The options "accidents" and "experiment" are less likely to be correct because they are specific activities that may occur during the process of learning about science, but they do not reflect the overall outcome of the process.
Mexico | Knowledge: Dos Equis is a Mexican beer brand, so it is most likely to be found in Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, except for Texas which is a state in the southern U.S. but that does not necessarily mean that a steak house in Texas serves Dos Equis.
stumble | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the singer's foot got caught on a wire while performing on a large stage, which caused him to lose his balance or trip. This is commonly referred to as a stumble. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - committing a sin, failing or disobeying do not seem relevant to the situation described, and a "boo boo" is too informal and childish to be used in this context.
feel relieved | Knowledge: Ibuprofen is a pain reliever commonly used to alleviate headaches, so it is likely that the person felt relief after taking it. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence, and there is no indication that anything else happened to the person after taking the ibuprofen.
montana | Knowledge: The phrase "Big Sky Country" is a nickname commonly associated with the state of Montana, which suggests that this is the correct answer. Beavers are semi-aquatic animals that are often found near rivers and streams, so this further supports the idea that Montana is the state in question. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
loving couple | Knowledge: The word "happiest" suggests that the question is looking for a positive relationship between the parents and the child. The phrase "loving couple" implies a healthy, supportive relationship between the parents, which can often lead to a happier child. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive relationship between the parents or even any parental involvement at all (e.g. "act of sex").
anger | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a mismatch between economic forces and a changing society, which can lead to negative emotions. Anger is a common response to feeling frustrated or powerless in the face of economic pressures. The other options, such as change in leadership or heartache, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
have fun | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is not concerned with making friends or drinking excessively, indicating that her main goal for attending the party is to enjoy herself. The phrase "have fun" is a broad, general statement that encompasses various activities one might engage in while at a party, such as dancing, socializing, or playing games. The other options either do not align with Jane's stated priorities, or are too specific or limited to fully encapsulate the breadth of what she might do at the party.
relief | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John finds buying Christmas presents stressful, which implies that he would feel relieved once the task is done. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
smoke | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that joining friends outside while they do something can be bad for your health. Only smoking has a clear correlation with negative health effects. The other options may be enjoyable or even beneficial for one's health, but they do not have a direct negative impact like smoking does.
indoors | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending time in nature is important, which implies that the opposite - being indoors - is not as beneficial. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence or do not convey the contrast between natural and man-made environments.
like | Knowledge: The question is likely related to the romantic or physical act of kissing, which is commonly associated with feelings of attraction or affection. "Like" is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a positive outcome of kissing, which is the development of positive feelings towards another person. The other options, such as drunkenness or herpes, are not necessarily related to the act of kissing itself and may be considered incorrect or inappropriate responses.
pride | Knowledge: The phrase "chest swelling" is often used metaphorically to describe pride or an increase in confidence. The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is experiencing a sense of excitement or satisfaction at the idea of gaining more land, which is consistent with feelings of pride. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
dry skin | Knowledge: The sentence implies that washing hands too often can have a negative consequence, which is commonly known to be dry skin. Frequent hand washing can strip the skin of natural oils and moisture, leading to dryness and irritation. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the potential negative effects of excessive hand washing.
cupboard | Knowledge: After a bowl is used, it is typically washed and then put away for future use. A cupboard or cabinet is the most common place to store dishes, including bowls, in a household. A restaurant may have a different system for storing dishes, such as a commercial dishwasher, but this would not be applicable to a general household setting. The trash and dishwasher options do not make sense as places to put a bowl after it is used.
feel relaxed | Knowledge: Chatting with friends is typically a casual and informal setting where people feel comfortable and at ease. The other options do not accurately describe the mood of chatting with friends. Love may be present in some friendships but it's not a defining mood for chatting. Social bonding can occur while chatting but it does not describe the overall mood. Talkative may describe the behavior of some people in a chat but not necessarily the mood, and gathering of information is not typically the primary focus of chatting with friends.
book | Knowledge: The word "history" suggests that the information being sought is likely to be found in a written format. While it is possible that a history of a kingdom could be found in other places such as museums or archives, a book would be the most likely primary source for such information. The other options lack any clear association with the context of the question.
Eastern United States | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the location being traveled to is on the Atlantic Ocean and on an expressway in North America. This limits the answer choices to locations on the east coast of the United States. Michigan is not on the east coast and is therefore an incorrect choice. "Large city" and "American city" do not provide any specific location information. "State" is too broad of a category and does not indicate a specific location. "Eastern United States" is the correct choice as it accurately describes the region where the Atlantic Ocean and expressways intersect.
music | Knowledge: The question is asking about what people might perform if they have a band. A band typically refers to a group of musicians who perform music together. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be music, as that is the primary activity associated with being in a band. The other options (standing ovation, tricks, applause, smile) do not make sense in this context.
atmosphere | Knowledge: The question implies that "heading to the sky" is a reference to traveling upwards, possibly in an aircraft or similar vehicle. In this context, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth and extends to outer space. Therefore, someone going "to the sky" would have to pass through the atmosphere to reach their destination. The other options are not related to the concept of moving upwards into the sky.
friend's house | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy went to get a bite to eat before going on a long vacation. It is unlikely that he would eat at a space shuttle or Disneyland as these are not common places for people to grab a quick meal. Supermarkets and gas stations may have food options, but they are not typically places where people would eat before going on a long vacation. Therefore, the most likely choice is that he ate at a friend's house, as this is a common location for a meal before leaving on a trip.
emergency kit | Knowledge: A tourniquet is a medical tool used to stop bleeding, typically in emergency situations. It is often recommended to keep a tourniquet in an emergency kit or first aid kit for easy access in case of an injury. Keeping a tourniquet in a hospital or ambulance would not be practical for most people, and applying even pressure would not be effective in all situations. Pocket is not a completely wrong option, but it implies that an individual should carry a tourniquet on their person, which is not the norm.
increase of temperature | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is experiencing cold weather and needs to find a way to warm up. Starting a fire or increasing the temperature are both logical choices for achieving this goal. Jumping in a swimming pool would likely only make the situation worse, and pleasure and feeling comfortable are not methods for getting warm.
dinner | Knowledge: Garlic bread is a popular side dish served during meals, particularly dinner. It is typically served warm alongside pasta, soup, or other main courses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
communication | Knowledge: Writing is a form of communication because it is a way of conveying information and ideas through written language. This may include letters, emails, memos, reports, and other types of written communication. Listening, carpal tunnel syndrome, revolutions, and writer's cramp are not related to the act of writing as a form of communication.
have no other choice | Knowledge: The use of the phrase "must" and the implication that people have to get up and live life suggests that they have no other option. The other choices may be motivating factors for why people get up and live life, but they do not explain the sense of obligation conveyed by the sentence. "Have no other choice" aligns with the sentiment that people feel compelled to live their lives, regardless of their personal circumstances.
printed on paper | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the big rolling machines are involved in the production of newspapers by processing the stories. This implies that the newspapers are printed on paper, which is the option that best relates to the context of the sentence. The other options - tree, recycled, written on paper, and local - do not fit the context as well as printed on paper.
mind | Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy's disability only affected his ability to move, but not his mental faculties. The choices "activity," "potence," "qualification," "competency," and "strength" all refer to physical abilities or attributes, so they do not fit the context of the sentence.
examine thing | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the CEO was curious about a specific product, which implies that she wanted to know more about it. The phrase "got the best of her" implies that her curiosity was strong and overpowering, which further reinforces the idea that she wanted to investigate the product in more detail. The option to "purchase it" would not necessarily satisfy her curiosity, while the options to "attend school" or "go to market" are not relevant to the context of the sentence. The option to "hear news" is too vague and does not provide enough information to make a clear choice.
legal problems | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the consequences of "hurting someone else" are being discussed. In this case, legal problems would be the most likely consequence, as it is against the law to harm another person. The other options do not make logical sense in this context - "more hurt" and "physical pain" suggest that the person who caused the harm would be the one experiencing pain, which is not specified in the sentence. "Public outcry" may be a consequence of a high-profile incident, but it does not necessarily imply any legal action. "Money" may come into play if there is a lawsuit, but it is not a direct consequence of hurting someone else.
sunny | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite a few clouds in the sky, the overall weather is still pleasant. "Sunny" is an appropriate choice for this because it indicates that the sun is shining brightly, which is often associated with good weather. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Clear sky" and "sunshine" are both related to good weather, but they do not account for the presence of a few clouds. "Bring rain" is the opposite of good weather, and "eat cake" is unrelated.
newspaper | Knowledge: Crossword puzzles are commonly found in newspapers as a form of entertainment and mental exercise for readers. The other options do not typically offer crossword puzzles as part of their offerings.
arts | Knowledge: The sentence states that two year college degrees come in two types, an associates of science or an associates of something else. The word "arts" is a commonly used term to refer to the "associates of something else" degree, while the other options do not fit this context. Additionally, an associates of arts degree is a common option for students who are interested in pursuing careers in fields like education, humanities, or social sciences.
eaten raw | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are different types of fish, but the important factor is whether they can be eaten raw. This implies that the answer is related to the concept of sushi, sashimi or other raw fish dishes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
listen | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys watching a film a second time specifically with the director's commentary, indicating that they are interested in gaining additional insights and perspectives on the film. Therefore, the correct answer is "listen", as this indicates an active engagement with the commentary. The other options do not accurately describe the person's behavior or intention.
errors | Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that writing a term paper too quickly can be detrimental in some way. One possible outcome could be making errors, as rushing through a task can result in overlooking important details and making mistakes. The other options (headaches, low mark, anxiety, frustration) are also possible outcomes of rushing through a term paper, but they do not necessarily imply that errors will be made.
condensate | Knowledge: When steam is cooled down, it loses its heat energy and begins to condense into water droplets. This process is called condensation and the resulting liquid is called condensate. The other options do not accurately describe what happens to steam when it is cooled down. Electric smoke and smoke are not related to steam, liquid water suggests that the steam completely disappears, and cold air is not a result of steam cooling down.
lake | Knowledge: The word "ripples" suggests that the object being described has a surface that is uneven or wavy. A mirror, object, and tetrahedron do not typically have this characteristic surface. Cottage cheese is a food item and not an object with a surface. Therefore, the correct answer must be "lake," as lakes have surfaces that can be rippled by wind or movement.
cupboard | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the board game was stored somewhere inside the house, and the most logical place to store a board game would be in a cupboard or shelf. Under the bed is not a common storage place for board games, and a toy store would not be a logical answer as this would suggest that the group had to go out and purchase the board game before playing it. House is too broad a term and doesn't provide any specific location within the house.
bus stop | Knowledge: A bus stop is a designated area where public transportation vehicles stop to pick up and drop off passengers. It is common for bus stops to have seating options for passengers who are waiting for their bus to arrive. Rest areas, theatres, and churches are not typically locations where public transportation is available. A bus depot is a transportation hub where buses are parked and maintained, but it is not a place where passengers typically wait for their bus.
older houses | Knowledge: Attics are commonly found in older homes, especially those built before the mid-20th century. These homes were often built with a peaked roof, which allowed for the creation of an attic space. Victorian houses, which were built in the late 19th century, are a specific example of older homes that often have attics. The other options, such as boxes and apartments, do not typically have attics.
determination | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that opening a business requires a specific quality that the individual must possess. "Workers" are not something the individual has inside them, but rather something they need to hire. "Money" and "funding" can be important for starting a business, but the sentence specifically mentions something the individual needs inside them. "Creativity" may be helpful, but it is not essential for starting a business. However, "determination" is often cited as a crucial quality for entrepreneurs because starting a business is frequently difficult and requires the ability to persevere through setbacks and obstacles.
more funding | Knowledge: Going public typically refers to a company's initial public offering (IPO), in which they offer shares of their stock to the general public for the first time. To do this, they need to have enough funds to cover the costs associated with the IPO, such as legal fees and underwriting fees. Therefore, someone who wants to go public would likely need to secure more funding in order to cover these costs. The other choices are not necessarily related to the process of going public.
cubicle | Knowledge: The sentence states that a chair might be found at an office, which is a place of work where people typically sit at desks or workstations. The only option that is related to a workspace is a cubicle, which is a type of office space that is enclosed on three sides and often contains a desk and chair. The other options (stadium, kitchen, porch, living room) do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
shopping mall | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place has a large number of indoor merchants, which is a characteristic commonly associated with shopping malls. Shopping malls typically have a variety of clothing stores, including stores that specialize in selling jeans. The other options, such as laundromats and hospitals, are unlikely to have a large number of indoor merchants selling jeans. Thrift stores may have a variety of clothing options, but they are typically not located in areas with a large concentration of indoor merchants.
fairytale | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John found something unexpected and fantastical in the well, which is a common feature of fairytales. Fairytales often involve magical creatures, enchanted objects or mysterious settings that are beyond the realm of the ordinary world. The other choices do not fit with the context of the sentence - a farm yard or farm country would not likely contain fantastical elements, Michigan is a state and therefore cannot be like "something out of", and a horror movie would suggest a scary or gruesome discovery, which is not implied by the sentence.
put in to the water | Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unable to do something specific with their ground pump because they forgot to pay the electricity bill. The options all relate to the potential risks of electricity, but only "put in to the water" suggests a limitation on the use of the ground pump due to a lack of electricity. It is likely that the ground pump requires electricity to function, and without it, the person cannot pump water from a source into their property. The other options, such as "cause fire" and "shock," are possible consequences of faulty electrical equipment, but they do not relate directly to the context of the sentence.
circus | Knowledge: The word "tricks" suggests that the elephant is trained to perform for entertainment purposes, which is commonly seen in circuses. Zoos may have elephants on display, but they typically do not train them to perform tricks. Safaris and Africa may have wild elephants, but it is unlikely that they would be performing tricks for an audience. India is known for its elephants, but it is not a clear indicator of where an elephant would be performing tricks.
