The use of a revolving door as a security measure is commonly associated with banks. The rotating mechanism helps regulate the flow of people in and out of the building, reducing the likelihood of a rush or a stampede. Additionally, the design of the doors can help prevent unauthorized access or escape by limiting the amount of space available to pass through at any one time. The other options may also use revolving doors, but they do not have the same security implications as a bank.
The context of the question is about work, which implies that people typically go to work to complete a job or perform some form of work-related task. Learning from each other and talking to each other may also happen at work, but they are not the primary goals. Killing animals and wearing hats are not typically associated with work unless it is a specific job requirement (such as in the case of a hunter or a hat salesperson).
Bookstores are known to carry a variety of printed works, including magazines, books, and newspapers. They are often visited by people looking for something to read or to purchase as a gift. Doctors' offices may have magazines and other printed material available for patients, but it is unlikely that they will have many other types of printed works for sale. Markets and train stations may have newsstands, but these typically only sell newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals. Mortuaries are unlikely to have any selection of printed material at all.
A hamburger is a type of food that is typically associated with fast food restaurants, as they are often sold at these establishments. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as they do not relate to the common location of where hamburgers are typically found. Additionally, the options "ground up dead cows" and "cow carcass" may be considered inappropriate or offensive responses.
The sentence indicates that James is searching for farmland, so the best option would be "farming areas". The other options might be helpful in a different context, but they don't necessarily relate specifically to looking for farmland. The midwest has many farming areas, but it is too broad to give a specific suggestion. The countryside and estate options could imply that James is looking for a specific type of property, but they don't necessarily indicate that those areas have farmland. Illinois may have farming areas, but it could also have other types of land that wouldn't meet James' needs.
The sentence is incomplete and lacks context. It is unclear what is being referred to with "ferret" and why a specific island country would be relevant. None of the given answer choices provide any information that would help in choosing a correct answer.
The question asks for a Spanish-speaking North American country that is known for its coffee. Mexico is a Spanish-speaking country located in North America that has a long history of coffee cultivation and production. The other options are not countries and do not have any clear connection to coffee or Spanish-speaking cultures in North America.
The context of the question suggests that the sentence is referring to how animals behave in response to a threat or danger. Listening to each other is a common tactic among animals, allowing them to communicate and coordinate their responses in the face of danger. The other options do not make sense in this context - feeling pleasure, procreating, and passing water are unrelated to responding to an enemy, while singing is only used by a few species of animals and is not typically associated with a response to danger.
The sentence suggests that reading a newspaper is a way to practice something. Literacy is the ability to read and write proficiently, so it makes sense that reading a newspaper would help improve one's literacy skills. The other options do not relate to the context of reading a newspaper as a practice.
Playing guitar typically involves the production of music through the plucking or strumming of strings on a guitar. While singing may also be part of playing guitar, it is not always the case. Similarly, while hearing sounds is a necessary part of playing guitar, it is not a unique characteristic of guitar playing. Arthritis is a medical condition that may affect someone's ability to play guitar, but it is not something that people typically do while playing guitar. Crying is also not typically associated with playing guitar, although it is possible that someone may cry while playing if the music evokes strong emotions.
Vinyl is a type of material commonly used for record albums and wallpaper, so it would not be odd to replace those things with vinyl. Pants and cheese have no obvious connection to vinyl, and a record store is not something that can be physically replaced with a material.
The sentence suggests that harmony is desired with the world, which is most likely achieved through peaceful actions. Making noise and making war are likely to create disharmony, while taking time and making haste do not have a clear connection to achieving harmony with the world. Therefore, making peace is the most logical answer.
A heifer is a young female cow that has not yet given birth, and is typically raised on a farm. Therefore, it is likely that the heifer's master, or owner, would also live on a farm. The other options do not fit the context of a heifer being raised on a farm, such as a stockyard or slaughterhouse. "Eat cake" is not a relevant option at all.
The question implies that the answer is something other than water and nourishment that a dog needs. Of the given choices, only "lots of attention" fits this criteria as dogs require social interaction and companionship. The other choices, such as bone or charm, may be nice for a dog to have but do not fulfill an essential need like attention does. "Petted" may also be a nice-to-have, but it is not a requirement for a dog's well-being. "Walked" is important for a dog's physical health, but is not the only thing a dog needs besides water and nourishment.
The sentence suggests that Janet is watching a film because she enjoys it, which is most commonly associated with being entertained. The other options, such as erection and fear, seem inappropriate and do not align with the context of the sentence. Laughter could be a reason for watching a film, but it is not the only one and the sentence does not explicitly suggest it. Bordem is also not specifically mentioned in the sentence and seems like an unlikely reason for someone to watch a movie.
The word "waiting" implies that someone is waiting for something, and the phrase "alongside with" suggests that they are waiting with someone or something else. In a reception area, this would typically mean waiting with other people who are also waiting to be seen or served. The other options, such as motels, chairs, hospitals, and hotels, do not fit the context of waiting alongside something.
The sentence implies that when consuming alcohol, one may need something to occupy their attention. "Examine thing" is the only logical option as it suggests looking at or exploring something, which could provide a distraction. The other options are either nonsensical, dangerous, or unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a fencing thrust with a sharp sword, which implies an intentional and forceful action. Injuries and small cuts are too general and do not specifically relate to the action described. Fever and competition are unrelated to the context of the sentence. A puncture wound is a more specific and accurate outcome of a fencing thrust with a sharp sword.
The sentence is comparing people to spiders and their sightseeing abilities. The phrase "unlike a spider and his many sightseers" suggests that spiders have many eyes to sightsee with, while people do not. This narrows down the possible answers to either "brains" or "two eyes." However, the second part of the sentence clarifies that people do have a visual sense, which means the correct answer is "two eyes." The other options are irrelevant or incorrect based on the given context.
The question is asking about the location where adults use glue sticks, which suggests a professional or work-related context. The options "classroom", "at school", and "desk drawer" may suggest a more academic setting, but the use of the word "adults" rules out these choices. "Kitchen drawer" may suggest a household setting, but again, the context of the question implies a workplace environment. Therefore, "office" is the most logical and likely answer.
The question is asking about what can be placed on top of wood, implying that the wood is being used as a base or foundation. The most logical answer is therefore "floor," as flooring is commonly installed on top of wood subfloors. The other options do not relate to this context - a lumberyard sells wood products rather than things that go on top of wood, a synagogue is a place of worship and not related to wood, carpet is typically placed over a subfloor rather than on top of wood, and a hardware store may sell items that can be used in conjunction with wood but not necessarily on top of it.
The sentence suggests that the artist was in a contemplative mood before he suddenly started painting. The word "pondering" implies that he was thinking deeply about something. The fact that he started painting implies that he was struck by an idea or inspiration. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. For example, sadness, anxiety, and discomfort would be more likely to inhibit creativity than inspire it. Insights are a little more ambiguous, but the sentence doesn't suggest that the artist was actively seeking understanding or knowledge at the time.
The sentence suggests that the thin film may seem fragile at first glance, but it is actually incredibly strong for its intended purpose. The word "nearly" suggests that the film is not completely indestructible, but very close to it. The other options, such as "durable" and "unbreakable," suggest strength but not necessarily to the same extreme degree as "indestructible."
The sentence suggests that there is a unique type of toilet that is only accessible to friends, which is unlikely to be found in public places such as rest areas, schools, stadiums, or hospitals. Apartments, on the other hand, often have private facilities that are only available to residents or their guests, which could explain why this type of toilet might be found in an apartment.
The sentence suggests that the person being referred to lacks intelligence and competence, as they are described as not being clever or bright. The word 'stupid' directly conveys this meaning. The other options may have some overlapping connotations, but they do not accurately capture the full meaning conveyed in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the focus is on reproduction in wildlife. The correct term for the young that are born as a result of reproduction is offspring. The other options are not accurate or appropriate in the context of reproduction in wildlife.
The sentence suggests that the weasel was causing problems by getting into the chicken eggs, which implies that the eggs were being stored in a place accessible to the weasel. A barn is a common place to keep chickens and their eggs, which makes it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Blue intentionally read material that was outside of his comfort zone, which implies that he was attempting to broaden his knowledge or gain a new perspective. This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices (entertained, understanding, hunger, tired eyes) do not relate to the goal of expanding one's perspective through reading.
The sentence implies that the person in question has just gotten hired and is hoping for success in their new position. The word "vocation" specifically refers to a person's career or profession, making it the most appropriate answer. "New job" is too broad and general, while "Michigan" and "manual" do not make sense in this context. "Working hard" is a characteristic that may lead to success but does not directly answer the question.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath, which is considered to be a criminal offense in many jurisdictions. Committing perjury can result in legal consequences such as indictment or imprisonment, but the most appropriate choice to complete the sentence would be "crime," since it accurately reflects the severity of the offense. "Violence" would not be an appropriate choice as perjury is not a violent act, and "lie" and "go to jail" are too specific or simplistic to capture the seriousness of the offense.
The word "postpone" means to delay or put off, so if someone is prone to doing this with their work, they will likely need to take action to speed up their progress in order to finish on time. The word "hasten" means to hurry or accelerate, making it the most appropriate choice for this context. The other options ("eat," "antedate," "bring forward," and "advance") do not have any clear correlation with the idea of completing work on time.
The sentence suggests that James is looking for an old underground map from the 50s, which is likely to be related to the subway system. Therefore, the most logical option would be the subway station where the map would have been used. The library, county engineer's office, and super market are unlikely to have such specific maps, and there is no context to suggest that James might find the map at home.
The sentence suggests that Sean was in a hurry to get home, but he encountered a yellow traffic light which forced him to do something other than hurry. The most logical option is to slow down, as this is a common response to a yellow traffic light. The other options, such as taking time or dawdling, do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. The inclusion of "ocean" as a choice is also irrelevant and does not make sense in the given sentence.
The phrase "waiting their turn" suggests that there is a queue or line that the person needs to join in order to wait their turn. "Standing in line" is a commonly used phrase to describe this action. "Getting in line" is also a possible answer, but "stand in line" is more specific and relevant in this context. "Having patience" is a general attitude that could apply to many situations, and "turn left" and "sing" are not related to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys volunteering at the senior center and gets some sort of positive feeling from it. "Satisfaction" is the best match for this sentiment, as it implies a sense of personal fulfillment and achievement from helping others. "Heart" and "feel better" are too vague and could refer to any number of emotions or sensations. "Pay" does not make sense in the context of volunteering, and "happines" does not fit as well as "satisfaction" due to the specific phrasing of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the thief was still attempting to steal the vehicle despite the lock preventing the steering wheel from moving, which implies that they were trying to access the key mechanism. The ignition switch is the part of the car that starts the engine and would therefore be the logical target for the thief. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide any indication of what the thief may have been trying to access.
Police officers usually work for a governmental jurisdiction such as a city, county, or state. The other options do not represent a typical employer for a police officer. "Beat" and "street" describe a patrol area or location, while "direct traffic" is a specific task within the job of a police officer. "President" is not an appropriate employer for a police officer.
The question involves storing leftover cake, which suggests that the cake should be preserved for later consumption. The most common way to preserve food items is by storing them in a refrigerator, which helps to slow down microbial growth and prevent food spoilage. The other options are not appropriate for storing perishable food items like cake. Quandry refers to a state of uncertainty, oven is used for baking and night stand is a piece of furniture, while bakery is a place where cakes are made and sold, not stored.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to completely immerse themselves in water, which is not possible with a coffee cup, cup, soft drink, or puddle. A whirlpool bath is a type of bathtub that has water jets that circulate the water, creating a swirling motion similar to a whirlpool. This makes it an ideal choice for someone who wants to submerge themselves in water. The other options do not offer a viable option for submerging oneself in water.
A doormat is typically placed in front of the front door of a building or house. The purpose of a doormat is to trap dirt and debris from shoes before entering the building, and this is most effective when placed directly in front of the entry point. While a doormat could technically be placed in some of the other options listed, such as an entrance porch or hallway, it is most commonly associated with the front door.
The sentence indicates that Bob the lizard lives in a warm place with lots of water. The answer choice that best fits this description is a tropical rainforest, which is known for high temperatures, high humidity, and abundant rainfall. The other options, such as rock and rocky places, do not necessarily suggest a warm place or lots of water. New Mexico, while warm, is known for arid desert landscapes rather than plentiful water. Jazz club is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that August was in danger of losing his house, which could happen if he was unable to pay his bills. Therefore, the correct answer is "pay bills." The other options do not relate to August's financial struggle or the consequences of not having enough money to pay for basic needs like housing.
The sentence suggests that the person needed more information to fix something, which implies that the object is a machine or device. Consulting a manual is a common way to obtain specific instructions for repairing or operating a device. The other options, such as chickens, google, newspaper, and online, do not have any clear connection to obtaining specific information for repairing a machine.
The question suggests that the picture frame is not hung vertically, meaning it is placed horizontally instead. The option "table" makes the most sense as it is a flat surface where a picture frame can be placed horizontally. The other options do not provide a clear surface for placing a picture frame horizontally, such as an art show, wall, newspaper, and car.
The sentence indicates that James was engaging in an illegal activity, which was buying beer for minors. Buying alcohol for individuals under the legal drinking age is a crime, and individuals who are caught engaging in such activities can be subject to fines, jail time, or other legal consequences. The other options do not provide any information that directly relates to the illegal nature of James' actions.
Applying for a job typically has the goal of securing employment. The other options are not common or desirable results of applying for a job. Anxiety and fear may be associated with the job interview process, but the ultimate goal is still to obtain employment. Increased workload may come after being employed, but it is not a direct result of applying. Praise and less sleep are also unlikely results of simply applying for a job.
The question implies that there is a prerequisite action that one must engage in before they can go shopping. Since the other options involve already having money or bringing cash with you, it can be inferred that the correct answer involves obtaining the money needed to make purchases. This is a common step that most people take before going shopping, as it is difficult to make purchases without any funds.
The context of the sentence suggests that John's role as first violin in a symphony orchestra requires him to bring something specific to work every day. Given that he is a violinist, it makes sense that he would need to bring his instrument with him in a protective case. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the place being described is relatively small and may not have modern amenities like elevators. Additionally, the use of a telephone book further supports the idea that the place may be a telephone booth, which is a small enclosure designed for making phone calls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "excited" implies that someone may want to own the crab as a pet. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is a pet shop. The other options do not make sense in this context. A fish market or fishmonger may sell crabs for consumption, but they would not be excited about the crab as a pet. The intertidal zone is a location where crabs may be found, but it is not a person or group of people who would be excited about a crab. Obesity is not related to the question.
The question is asking specifically for clothes that aren't pants, so the answer must be a shop that sells garments other than pants. Of the given choices, only a dress shop would likely carry clothing options that do not include pants. The other options are either unrelated or do not offer any indication that they would carry non-pant clothing options.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is having difficulty communicating clearly while intoxicated. This is commonly associated with slurred speech, where the words become unclear and difficult to understand. A seizure and death are unlikely outcomes of getting drunk, and forgetfulness and passing out do not specifically relate to communication difficulties.
The sentence suggests that the person is just starting work, which implies that they are trying to get themselves into a productive state of mind. Building momentum refers to the process of gathering energy and motivation to get started on a task, which is likely to be the person's goal. Time and tiredness are not things that a person can "build," and "working" and "accomplishing" do not convey the same sense of starting out or gathering energy.
The sentence implies that the child wants to engage in an activity that is typically associated with play. Playing tag is a common childhood game that involves running around and chasing after others, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options are either dangerous or do not have any clear connection to the idea of playing.
The sentence suggests that the act of repeatedly talking to the same person about the same thing can become tiresome. This is a common experience for many people, and can often lead to feelings of frustration, boredom, or even annoyance. The other options do not necessarily relate to the idea of getting tired of something or someone.
The sentence suggests that the context is a test, which is typically taken in a classroom. The other options (movie theatre, bowling alley, factory, store) are unlikely to be places where a test would be administered, and therefore can be eliminated as choices. Additionally, the use of the word "teacher" further supports the conclusion that the correct answer is "classroom."
The sentence suggests that the freeway is located in a rural or sparsely populated area, as there is no traffic and few buildings. This eliminates options such as California, big town, and Florida, which are all known for their busy highways and urban development. "Countryside" is the most fitting option, as it implies a location outside of a major city or suburban area. "America" is too broad to be the correct answer, as it does not provide any specific details about the location of the freeway.
The question suggests that the activity involves a small group of people and is likely to be social in nature. Watching television and going to the cinema are activities that can be done alone or with a large group, while going to a fairground may be too crowded or overwhelming for a small group. "Good" is not a viable answer option as it is not a location or activity. Going to a friend's house is a common choice for a small group outing as it provides a comfortable and intimate setting for socializing and having fun with friends.
The sentence describes a place that is hot and arid, which suggests that it is likely to be in a desert or similar region where the terrain is sandy and dry. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bland," "lifeless," and "neutral" describe qualities that are not related to climate or geography, while "freezing" suggests a cold climate, which contradicts the description of the place as "hot and arid."
There is no definitive answer to this question, as what satisfies one person's curiosity may not satisfy another's. For example, someone who is interested in current events may find hearing news to be the most satisfying, while someone who enjoys comedy may find a comedy show to be more fulfilling. Therefore, it is important to consider the context and personal interests of the individual when choosing an answer to this question.
The phrase "glove shaped state" is a common reference to Michigan, as the state resembles a mitten or glove. The other options do not have any connection to the context of being in a bar in a specific state.
The sentence suggests that the computer user is using their own computer, which would typically mean that they are in a location where they have access to their personal computer. The options "hell" and "school" are unlikely locations for using a personal computer, while "internet cafe" suggests that the user is accessing a shared computer. "Indoors" could be a possibility, but it is too broad to make a definitive choice. Therefore, "house" is the best option as it specifically refers to a location where someone would have their own personal computer.
Crabs are aquatic animals and are typically found in bodies of saltwater such as oceans, seas, and estuaries. The other options are either specific locations (Galapagos, fish market) or more general descriptions of the environment (maritime, bodies of water) that do not specify the type of water in which crabs live.
Tall grass is a common habitat for snakes. The other options, such as tree or in a jar, do not make sense in the context of the question. Snakes can also be found in tropical forests, but the question specifically mentions tall grass, which is a common feature of fields. Pet shops are also an irrelevant option as they usually do not keep snakes in tall grass.
The use of the word "nestled" suggests that the bench is in a natural setting rather than a city or urban environment. A state park is a protected area of land that is often known for its natural beauty and includes features like trees, trails, and benches for visitors to rest and enjoy the environment. The other options do not have a clear association with benches in a natural setting.
The question is asking about the likely action a person would take when they are hungry. Option A, eating in a restaurant, is commonly associated with satisfying hunger, as restaurants specialize in providing food to customers. The other options, while related to food, do not necessarily guarantee that hunger will be satisfied, and may require time or resources that a hungry person may not have available.
The sentence suggests that the subject is experiencing doubts or hesitation about their decision to fight, likely due to a perceived disadvantage or unfavorable matchup. The description of the opponent as "confident" implies that they are skilled or experienced in some way, giving the subject reason to believe that the fight will be harder than they initially anticipated. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence or offer any insight into the subject's thoughts or feelings.
A shower stall is a contained area specifically designed for taking showers, and a shower curtain is commonly used to prevent water from splashing outside of the stall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a bathtub may require multiple curtains or none at all, a washing area may not require a curtain, a hotel may have different styles of bathrooms, and a department store does not use shower curtains for their intended purpose.
The question is asking where it is a good idea to have a fire extinguisher, but not required. A house is a common place where fires can occur, especially in the kitchen, so having a fire extinguisher nearby can be helpful in case of emergency. The other options may also be places where fires can occur, but they may have special regulations or requirements for fire safety equipment. A school bus or boat, for example, may have their own fire suppression systems already in place, and hospitals and schools may have specific fire safety protocols that go beyond just having a fire extinguisher.
Castles are typically associated with medieval European history, which suggests that the answer is likely to be a European country/continent. Additionally, Edinburgh is a city in Scotland known for its historic castle, while fairy tale is a genre and not a geographic location. Antarctica is mostly uninhabitable and unlikely to have castles. This leaves Germany and Europe as the remaining choices, but Germany is just one country within Europe and may not have the most castles overall. Therefore, the correct answer is Europe.
The question states that the book in question is "very dry and long," which suggests that it may be difficult to engage with or find interesting. The word "bored" is also a common descriptor for this type of situation, as it implies a lack of engagement or enjoyment. The other answer choices are either irrelevant to the context of the question (e.g. "have time" or "learn new") or are the opposite of the expected outcome (e.g. "enjoyable").
The mention of reading off names at the beginning of the day suggests that Sally could be a teacher or administrator in a school setting. Using a clipboard to hold papers is also a common practice in schools to keep important documents organized and easily accessible. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the kids left a mess behind, which is typically associated with playing with toys. Learning things or talking do not necessarily create a mess, while going to Disneyland is not directly relevant to the sentence. Playing games could potentially create a mess, but it is less likely to be assumed than playing with toys.
The sentence indicates that the answer relates to a game involving a pawn, which is commonly associated with the game of chess. The statement also implies that all the pieces in the game are important, which is true for chess as each piece has a specific role and purpose. The other options (scheme, checkers, North Carolina) are not related to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a basketball with a hole but still retains its shape. This eliminates the option "gone," which suggests that the basketball no longer exists or has lost its shape entirely. The other options all have to do with characteristics of a basketball: it can be "punctured" by something sharp, it is "full of air" to maintain its round shape, and it is "popular in America" as it is a common sport in the country. The option "round" is also a characteristic of a basketball as it is a spherical object.
The sentence suggests that the problem is waking up frequently throughout the night, which may be due to the need to get out of bed and attend to things that are on the person's mind. Irritability and discomfort may contribute to the problem but they are not the likely cause given the context of the sentence. Depression and happiness are not related to the sentence.
A wild bird is not typically found living in a cage, windowsill, or desert. The countryside may offer habitat for some species of wild birds, but the most common and natural habitat for a wild bird is the sky, where they are free to fly and roam. Therefore, the correct answer is "sky."
White mice are often used in laboratories for scientific experiments and research purposes. They are easy to handle and breed, making them a popular choice for genetic studies and pharmacology research. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests a contrast between John's belief in fate and Harry's belief in an alternative option. The word "different" also suggests that Harry believed John could have chosen an alternative course of action, indicating the importance of choices. Therefore, "choice" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "free will," "will," "alcohol," and "freedom" do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
Committing murder is a serious offense that can weigh heavily on a person's conscience. The act of taking another person's life can have long-lasting psychological effects, including feelings of guilt and remorse. Therefore, it is likely that committing murder would prevent someone from having a clear conscience or feeling at peace with themselves. The other options are not necessarily directly related to murder and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence explicitly states that George didn't have a car but still had his two feet, implying that he could move from place to place by walking. The description of his smelly socks and blistered soles further suggests that he uses his feet a lot. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a crane is being used in a context involving the use of steel cables, which is a common feature in construction sites where cranes are used to lift heavy objects. The other options- abaft, ship, winch, and building- do not provide any clear indication of a context where a crane would require the use of steel cables.
The sentence suggests that farmers have a main purpose, which is something they prioritize above other activities. The options given all relate to farming in some way, but only "supply food" directly speaks to the purpose of farming. While raising cattle, growing corn, and farming land are all aspects of the farming process, their main goal is to produce food for consumption. Driving tractors is a part of the process but not the main purpose of being a farmer.
A piggy bank is a container specifically designed to hold coins and small amounts of money for saving. The other options are not typically used for saving coins or small amounts of money, and may not be secure or convenient for this purpose. A wallet is used to hold paper money and credit cards, while a toy, ground, or pocket do not offer any protection or organization for coins.
The question is about where to put uncooked crab meat, suggesting that it needs to be cooked in order to be consumed. The only option that relates to cooking is the stew pot. The other options, such as the wharf or tidepools, may be places where crab meat is obtained, but they do not pertain to the task of cooking uncooked crab meat. The boss's office and Red Lobster are also irrelevant to the question.
The sentence suggests that the man had a fear of illness and avoided visiting certain people as a result. The most likely choice for someone to avoid if they were afraid of illness would be a sick person, as they would be more likely to spread germs or be contagious. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of illness or disease, and would not necessarily be avoided by someone with a fear of illness.
The sentence implies that the pans are being transported from one place to another, as the question asks where to put them if you want to bring them with you. The options "cooking" and "cook food" do not make sense in this context, as they refer to the act of using pans rather than storing or transporting them. "Kitchen" and "drawer" may be places to store pans, but they do not fit the requirement of bringing them with you. "Backpack" is the only option that fits the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that remembering something is a result of having knowledge of it to begin with. This makes sense as memory is often linked to one's ability to retain and recall information that they have learned or experienced. The other answer choices, such as "forgetful," "pleasure," and "depression," do not align with the idea of remembering information based on prior knowledge.
The question implies that there is a large land mass where monkeys can be found in significant numbers, and the option "African continent" is the most likely choice since it is home to several species of monkeys, including baboons, vervet monkeys, and colobus monkeys. The other options do not provide any information about monkey habitats or populations.
The fact that Friday was James's 5th anniversary and that they planned on going to bed early suggests that they may have scheduled some romantic activity for the occasion. "Making love" is a common phrase used to refer to sexual activity between romantic partners, so this option is the most likely answer. "Rest" and "sleeping in" suggest a normal night's sleep, which would not be a special way to celebrate an anniversary. "Insomnia" refers to difficulty sleeping, which is the opposite of what James and their partner planned. "Texting" is unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the teens were trying to conceal their consumption of alcohol, but their actions upon entering the door revealed the truth. The option "stagger" fits this context as it suggests unsteadiness or swaying, which can be a sign of intoxication. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context and may not apply to the situation described. For example, "get arrested" suggests a more extreme outcome that may not have occurred in this case.
The word "landing" suggests a space for individuals to step off or onto a set of stairs. This is common in a stairwell, where individuals can stop and rest or change direction. The other options do not have stairs that would require a landing at the top. An ocean, airport, apartment building or room would not have a landing at the top.
The sentence suggests that anyone could be hired in the kitchen, implying that the job did not require any particular skills or qualifications. The specific task mentioned in the choices, washing dishes, is commonly associated with entry-level kitchen jobs that do not require extensive experience or training. The other choices, such as forgetting or questioning authority, do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence. The repeated choice, "oik squeaky hinge," is likely a typo and can be disregarded.
The term "wind instruments" refers to a family of musical instruments that require air to create sound (e.g. flute, saxophone, trumpet, etc.). These instruments are commonly found in orchestras and other musical groups, such as symphonies. A symphony typically has a section of wind instruments, along with string and percussion instruments. The other options do not mention anything about musical instruments or public places where they might be found.
The term "mountie" is slang for a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is primarily based in Canada. The reference to a subway stop suggests that the city in question has a subway system. While Chicago and New York City have subway systems, they do not have a large number of Mounties, as this law enforcement agency operates only in Canada. Toronto is a major city in Canada with a subway system and is therefore the most likely answer.
The word "illustrate" implies that the communication is visual or graphical in nature, and the purpose of illustrating a point is often to make it clearer to the audience. "Make clear" is the best answer as it directly relates to this purpose. "Did not understand" and "accepted" are not relevant to the question, and both "understood" and "understanding" are already assumptions that someone has comprehended the point being made, rather than actions that could be taken.
The sentence suggests that Billy is intentionally setting aside time for something enjoyable after work. The most logical reason for this is to alleviate stress and unwind after a long day of work. The other options, such as ocean or laughter, are not directly related to the sentence or to the idea of setting aside specific time for leisure activities. The options happiness and pleasure are related to leisure, but do not necessarily explain why Billy is deliberately making time for fun after work.
The sentence states that the man in the white suit was lazy and did nothing useful, while the man in the blue put in effort. This suggests that the man in the blue was productive, meaning he accomplished something useful or valuable. The other choices, such as restless or hard work, do not necessarily indicate that the man was productive, but rather may describe his behavior or attitude. Lazybutt is not a commonly used term, and does not fit the tone of the sentence.
The question is asking about the consequences of having too much greed. Greed is a desire for excessive wealth or possessions, and someone who is consumed by it may prioritize their own interests over the needs or feelings of others. This can make it difficult to form and maintain friendships, as a strong focus on personal gain can alienate others and make them feel undervalued. The other options may be affected by greed to some extent, but they are not inherently or directly linked to the negative effects of excessive greed.
The sentence suggests that the traveler stayed in a hotel after a long trip from the farm, which implies that he arrived in a populated area with accommodation options. The other options, such as a WWII bunker or Las Vegas, do not provide suitable locations for a traveler to stay in a hotel after a long trip. A resort could be a possibility, but the sentence does not offer any clues about the type of destination the traveler was heading to.
The sentence implies that needing a servant is a characteristic often associated with being wealthy or having a high social status. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Canals are often crossed by bridges, making this the most logical answer based on general knowledge of transportation infrastructure. The other options (Michigan, Amsterdam, Venice, barges to travel on) are either specific locations or modes of transportation, and do not provide a general solution to the question.
The question asks about eliminating preconceived notions when learning about the world and different cultures. Having an open mind means being willing to consider new ideas and perspectives without judgment or bias. This is important for eliminating preconceived notions, which are pre-existing opinions or beliefs that can limit our understanding of new information. The other options, such as newness or smartness, do not necessarily relate to this idea of open-mindedness and are less relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there was a time when computers were not as advanced as they are now, and that doing something which is now commonplace was a big deal then. The word "workflow" also suggests that the sentence is discussing the functionality of computers. Therefore, the correct answer would be something that relates to the functional capabilities of computers. Out of the given options, only "multitask" refers to a specific functional capability of computers, which is the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The other options are either not directly related to the sentence or are too basic to be considered a big deal.
The sentence suggests that when police officers use "obstructing justice" as an excuse for their brutality, it can cause a strong reaction in people. The most extreme reaction listed in the choices is a riot, which implies that people may feel outraged and may resort to violence or protest. The other options do not adequately capture the intensity of the reaction described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the clothes were caught on a sharp object while being washed, which implies that they suffered some sort of damage. The most likely type of damage would be tearing, since a sharp object could easily cut through fabric. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not describe a negative outcome caused by the sharp object.
The sentence suggests that seafood restaurants are a strategy for attracting tourists to a certain location. The options "maine" and "boston" are specific locations, but the other options are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "coastal cities," which refers to areas along the coast where seafood restaurants are likely to be found and may attract tourists.
The sentence indicates that James's niece was asking him about her grandfather, which suggests that she was interested in learning more about her family history. The most relevant option for this context is "family tree," which refers to a diagram depicting the familial relationships and ancestry of a person or family. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or interest in learning more about family history.
The sentence describes James looking up and seeing stars twinkling in the "black yonder," which suggests that he is observing the night sky. The other options, such as "universe" and "outer space," are too broad and do not accurately reflect what is being described in the sentence. Additionally, the mention of the "size" of something further supports the idea that James is observing the night sky, as it is common to marvel at the vastness and seeming infinitude of the stars and galaxies visible in the night sky.
The sentence implies that the person wants to continue playing tennis, and exercise is a common motivation for playing sports. Exercise provides physical and mental benefits, such as improved stamina and release of endorphins, which can positively impact one's mood and motivation to continue playing. The other options are unlikely to encourage someone to continue playing tennis, as becoming tired and developing tennis elbow are negative consequences, hunger is unrelated, and victory is not always guaranteed.
The sentence suggests that the sound James heard had a calming effect on him, to the point where he almost fell asleep despite his efforts to resist the urge. This implies that the sound had a certain quality or characteristic that commonly induces relaxation, such as a slow and steady rhythm, low volume, or soothing tone. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or contradict the idea of relaxation.
The phrase "dime store" refers to a type of small, inexpensive retail store that was popular in the early to mid-20th century. These stores were typically found in small neighborhoods or downtown commercial areas, rather than in larger shopping malls or commercial buildings. The phrase "old movie" and the word "past" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the word "mall" suggests a larger, more modern shopping location, which is not typically where dime stores were located.
An unused chess set is often stored in a place where it can be easily accessed when needed but is not taking up everyday space. The living room and cupboard are both places where items are often displayed or regularly used, so they may not be the best location for an unused chess set. Michigan is a state and not a location for storage. A toy store is a place where chess sets can be purchased, but not necessarily stored. An attic is a common location for storing items that are not needed often, but should be kept in a safe and dry place.
The sentence indicates that James is warning his son to be cautious because there are many frogs mating in the area. Therefore, James would not want his son to disturb or interrupt the mating process, as it could potentially harm the frogs or disrupt their reproductive cycle. The other answer choices do not make as much sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the man wants air conditioning while he watches the game on Saturday, which implies that he will be at home. Air conditioning is commonly found in homes to provide a comfortable indoor temperature, especially during hot weather. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A balalaika is a Russian stringed instrument commonly used in folk music. It is not likely to be played by a movie doctor, a cat, or in a music store. While it is possible that someone could be playing it in a symphony or orchestra, that is the most likely option because these groups typically include a wide variety of instruments, including those with unique cultural origins.
The sentence suggests that the type of boat involves the sailors' namesake, implying that the boat is named after sailors or has a connection to sailing. The term "sailors" is also used in the sentence, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is related to sailing. The other options do not have any clear connection to sailors or sailing.
The context suggests that the person is seeking shelter from the rain, and both a bus stop and a tunnel provide covered areas. Synagogue and fairy tale do not have any clear connection to the context, and while a street corner may provide some cover, it is not as effective as a bus stop or tunnel.
The question is asking for a reason why someone would like a large house. Owning a large house provides lots of space to have multiple rooms, store belongings, and entertain guests. The other options, such as having a choice, being mentally challenged, owning a house, or being obese, are not directly related or synonymous with having a large house.
The word "cheap" suggests that the book is being sold at a reduced price, which is a common feature of discount stores. Bookstores, classrooms, and school rooms may sell books, but they are not typically associated with discounted prices. A book may be found on a bedside table, but this does not provide any information about where it can be purchased.
The sentence suggests that John and James made a foolish decision by buying tickets to a specific event, and that neither of them wanted to see something related to the event. The context clues point towards a sporting event, as the options include a hockey game and a general "sporting event." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the professional duties of professors. Teaching courses is a common responsibility of professors in universities and colleges. The other options either do not relate to the job of a professor (methods of facts, state facts) or are stereotypes that do not necessarily apply to all professors (wear wrinkled tweed jackets). School students could be a possible answer, but it is not specific enough as professors can also work with graduate students, researchers, and other professionals.
The sentence suggests that colorful anemones resemble an object commonly found in flower beds. Flower beds are known for containing a variety of colorful blooms, which may explain the comparison to colorful anemones. The other options, such as intertidal zones, coral seas, and under water, do not have any clear connection to flower beds or colorful objects. The Florida Keys may be known for their colorful sea life, but this option does not fit the comparison to an object found in a flower bed.
Aliens are typically believed to originate from beyond the Earth, in what is commonly referred to as outer space. While some conspiracy theories may suggest specific locations, such as Roswell, these claims are not proven and do not have broad scientific support. The universe as a whole could technically be considered the origin of all life, but in the context of the question, outer space is the most logical and likely answer. Mars is a planet in our solar system and while it has been explored by humans, there is no evidence to suggest it is a source of alien life. Weekly world news is a tabloid and not a credible source of information.
The context suggests that the hikers stopped to have a drink, indicating that they were likely thirsty and needed to hydrate. The other options such as "had a party" or "getting drunk" do not fit the context of the sentence as there is no indication of celebration or excessive drinking. "Refreshment" is a possible answer, but "were thirsty" is a more direct and specific choice.
The sentence implies that the action being referred to should occur before beginning work, and the context suggests that it is a personal hygiene routine. Sleeping or applying for a job are not relevant to the context of getting ready for work in the morning. "Just do" and "concentrate" are vague and do not provide a clear answer. Therefore, the correct answer is "shower."
The sentence suggests that the kitten was trying to stop, but because it had nothing to dig its claws into, it slid across something. The only option that fits this context is "floor," as a smooth surface would make it difficult for the kitten to stop. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "trying to keep something in their hand" suggests that the person is attempting to physically grasp and control an object. The correct answer, "have to hold," aligns with this meaning and conveys the idea that the person needs to maintain physical contact with the object in order to keep it in their possession. The other options are not related to the act of physically holding onto something.
The sentence implies that there are a great number of homes in a specific location. The options "field," "neighborhood," and "apartment building" do not fit the description of a large number of homes in one location. The option "star can" is not a common or recognizable term. "City or town" is the logical choice, as cities and towns typically have large populations and numerous residences.
The sentence mentions that playing baseball, like any other sport, carries a risk. This implies that there is a potential for harm, such as physical injury, while participating in the activity. Sore muscles and errors are possible outcomes of playing any sport, but they do not necessarily imply a risk. Happiness and fun are positive emotions that may be associated with playing baseball, but they are not related to the potential risks of the sport.
The sentence indicates that the person wants to watch a movie without leaving their home, which suggests that they will likely use a device that can display movies within their home. While some people may have personal movie collections or rent movies from a physical video store, the most common option nowadays is likely to be watching a movie on television. Television sets can display movies either through cable or streaming services, allowing the viewer to access a wide variety of movies without ever leaving their home. The other options, such as a drive-in movie or a live show, would require the person to leave their home to watch the movie.
The word "stand" usually refers to appearing in court as a witness or defendant. The sentence also mentions "today," which suggests that the person was scheduled to appear in court that day. The word "testify" specifically refers to giving evidence in a legal setting, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either suggest a different action or are too vague.
The sentence implies that the grooming session was successful, which means that the dog was well-groomed and looked clean and neat. Therefore, the owner is likely to feel satisfied with the outcome of the session. The other options don't fit the context of the sentence. Mistakes suggest that something went wrong during the grooming, growth has no clear connection to dog grooming, and late is not relevant to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the runner is making efforts to move up from third place to second place, which indicates that he is trying to gain ground on the runner in second place. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe an action that would lead to the runner potentially reaching second place.
Mammoth Cave is a national park located in the state of Kentucky in the United States. It is the longest known cave system in the world and attracts many visitors each year. The other answer choices do not have any connection to Mammoth Cave or its location.
Applying for a job can be a stressful and uncertain process, as it often involves a lot of competition and uncertainty about whether or not one will be selected. Anxiety and fear are common emotions that people experience when applying for a job, as they may worry about not being qualified, making a mistake on their application, or not being selected for an interview. The other options (horror, rejection, increased workload, being employed) do not accurately reflect the typical emotions associated with job applications.
The sentence suggests that the person on trial said something questionable, which is likely related to committing perjury (lying under oath). Additionally, the sentence implies that the person was found guilty of something, which would logically be related to their trial for obstructing justice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that buying presents for others creates a positive emotional response. The phrase "make happy" is a common collocation that describes the emotional impact of doing something nice for someone else, like buying them a present. The other options (tears, please, like, thank) do not accurately describe the emotional response that buying presents typically creates.
Marmots are typically found in high elevation mountain areas, which are often characterized by green landscapes that are commonly referred to as the countryside. The other options do not fit this description, as the great plains are more flat and less mountainous, an encyclopedia is not a physical location, jungles are typically found in tropical areas, and North America is a continent with a variety of geographic features.
The context of the sentence suggests that Jan is testing an electrical circuit, and specifically testing the current flowing through the wires. The fact that he notices the current is high suggests that there is some impedance to the flow of the electricity. The correct answer option is "resistance," which is a property of electrical circuits that describes the degree to which the circuit impedes the flow of current. None of the other answer options have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about what a kindergarten teacher does before nap time, and the choices suggest different actions a teacher could take. Encouraging children may be something a teacher does throughout the day, but specifically before nap time, telling a story is a common practice to help children relax and transition into a restful state. Lowering expectations and giving a time test would not be appropriate activities before nap time and could actually make children more anxious, while fear is not a positive emotion to associate with a teacher's actions.
The sentence suggests that Mark treated Sam kindly, even though Sam was a stranger. Treating a stranger like a friend is an action that shows goodwill and positivity. The other options, such as family or known person, do not necessarily indicate the same level of warmth or kindness towards a stranger. The options park and outsider are also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The statement indicates that Bob is in a closed space with no visible door, and his only source of light is a small bulb. This suggests that he could be in a closed room or a small enclosed space, such as a closet or a box. The other options do not fit the description of a closed space with no visible doors and a small light source.
James compares criminal justice to a computer program, suggesting he values efficiency and functionality. Therefore, he may not like the concept of "powering down," which would imply a lack of activity or productivity. The other choices all relate to processes and control, which align more closely with James' comparison to computer programming.
The phrase "card slot" suggests that the machine mentioned requires the use of a bank card to operate, which is a typical feature of an automated teller machine (ATM) or bank machine. Ticket machines and telephones do not typically have this feature, and while slot machines may use a card in some contexts, they are not commonly associated with balancing finances. Understanding the context of the situation and the common features of different types of machines can help in choosing the correct answer.
Playing sports professionally requires a certain level of skill and proficiency. This is typically achieved through regular and consistent practice. Athletes spend countless hours practicing their techniques and strategies to improve their performance. The other options, like washing clothes or taking off uniforms, are not directly related to the skill required to play sports professionally. Getting in shape and stretching may be important aspects of physical preparation, but they do not fully capture the idea of practice.
The sentence implies that there are two different ways people release energy, and one of those ways is through "exercise." The other options may be related to physical activity, but they do not specifically refer to the act of expending energy through intentional physical activity, as "exercise" does.
The sentence mentions a person going for a jog, which implies that they will need to wear clothes that are suitable for physical activity. Comfortable clothes are the most likely choice for someone who wants to jog, as they provide flexibility and breathability while also being durable enough to withstand the rigors of exercise. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence and do not offer any insight into what a person going for a jog might wear.
The sentence suggests that the child was pretending to read a newspaper because they couldn't actually do it. This implies that the child didn't have the ability to read the words on the page, making literacy (the ability to read) a necessary factor in being able to read the newspaper. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that Jenny enjoyed helping people, which implies that it provided her with a positive feeling or emotion. The most likely emotion associated with helping others is satisfaction or a sense of accomplishment. The other options such as complications and train do not make sense in this context. "Feel good about yourself" is a possible option, but satisfaction is a more commonly used phrase to describe this feeling.
Cleaning clothes is typically associated with the act of removing dirt, stains, and other unwanted substances from clothing in order to maintain a high level of cleanliness and sanitation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "sanitation." The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not associated with the act of cleaning clothes.
The question involves a specific location that has a basement accessible by elevator. The options "eat cake," "closet," and "own house" do not make sense as answers as they are not locations commonly known to have elevators that lead to basements. "Church" is also unlikely as typically churches do not have basements accessible by elevator. "Office building" is the most likely answer as many modern office buildings have multiple levels and are equipped with elevators to access the different floors, including the basement.
The sentence suggests that in order to learn programming from another person, one option is to take a class. This is a common way to learn programming, as classes provide structured instruction and support from a teacher. The other options may not provide the same level of guidance or instruction, or may not be relevant to the context of learning programming from someone else.
The sentence mentions that the person is at the gym trying to build muscle, which implies that they are focusing on strengthening and developing their own muscles. The options "body of animal" and "body of dog" do not make sense in this context as it is unlikely that a person would be trying to build muscle on an animal's body. "Arm" is a body part that the person may be focusing on, but it only refers to a specific area and not the whole body. "Bodybuilder" is a term used to describe someone who actively participates in bodybuilding competitions, but it does not answer the question of what is being built. Therefore, "human body" is the most appropriate answer.
The question is asking for the part of plants that is pretty, and the option "flowers on" is the only one that fits that description. Flowers are often considered the most attractive part of a plant due to their vibrant colors and patterns, and they are often used in gardens and decorations. The other options, such as "dirt" and "no neurons in," do not have any connection to beauty or aesthetics. "Millions of cells" and "roots" are important parts of plants, but they are not typically considered pretty.
The sentence suggests that the man is choosing to go fishing instead of going to work, which implies that he is seeking something other than a paycheck. The word "fishing" is also associated with leisure activities and outdoor recreation, which suggests that the man is seeking relaxation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: "food" does not explain why the man is skipping work, "killing" is not an appropriate reason for skipping work, "missing morning cartoons" is unrelated, and "boredom" suggests a lack of engagement with work rather than a deliberate choice to skip it.
The word "pit" suggests that this question is referring to a fruit that has a hard center, such as a cherry or a peach. The word "unsmooth" suggests that the pit is not completely round or even. An unsmooth pit is a common characteristic of a peach pit, which is often oval-shaped and has a slightly bumpy texture. The other options, such as backyard and mine, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the man struggles with keeping up with the conversation, which may suggest that he is not good at initiating or ignoring topics. The fact that he "tried to reply" suggests that he wants to participate in the conversation, but is having trouble doing so. Therefore, it is likely that he is having difficulty with formulating the right questions to ask in response to the woman's statements. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence clearly states that the speaker was unable to find anyone who remembered the event, indicating a lack of memory. The word "adroit" means skilled or proficient at something, suggesting that the missing persons were skilled at forgetting the event. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is large and luxurious, with a grand dining room that would typically only be found in a mansion. The mention of a "fancy chandelier" further emphasizes the opulence of the setting. The other options do not fit the description of a grand and luxurious dining room.
The sentence suggests that the cargo plane has specialized requirements for landing, which may be related to its size or weight. Military bases often have runways that are designed to accommodate large aircraft and may have additional security measures in place, which could explain why the specialized runway is located at a military base. The other options, such as a back yard or bowling alley, are unlikely to have a suitable runway for an extremely large cargo plane to land.
The sentence implies that the location where the smelly carpet was installed was used for a recreational activity that involved a league. Bowling alleys typically have carpeted floors and are often used by bowling leagues for competitions or regular play. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Brownstones are a type of row house typically found in the northeastern United States, especially in cities like New York City and Brooklyn. They often have a characteristic front door with a bell or intercom system, and visitors can typically gain entry by ringing the doorbell or buzzing the intercom. The other options do not have any clear connection to how one might enter a brownstone.
An upright piano is a type of piano that is designed to be stood vertically, and is commonly used in homes and music rooms rather than on stage. As such, it is reasonable to assume that someone looking to purchase an upright piano would go to a place that specializes in music equipment, such as a music store. The other options, such as a music class, college, or band, do not necessarily have a clear connection to the selling or purchasing of musical instruments.
An ottoman is typically used as a footstool or additional seating in a living room or sitting area. Placing it near the front door would suggest that it is intended for guests or family members to sit on while putting on or taking off shoes before entering or leaving the house. The other options (parlor, furniture store, basement, kitchen) do not make sense in the context of keeping an ottoman near the front door.
The sentence suggests that diving into backyard pools can lead to a serious injury that specifically affects the spine. This is because diving into shallow water can cause the head to hit the bottom of the pool, which can result in trauma that affects the spinal cord. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the snake is in a cage, which suggests that it is likely in a controlled environment such as a pet store. The other options do not provide any context to suggest why a snake would be in a cage in those locations.
The phrase "end of line" often refers to the place where people queue up to wait for a service or product, such as in a grocery store or amusement park ride. It is common for people to become impatient when they are waiting in line for a long period of time, especially if they are at the end of the line and can see others making progress ahead of them. The other options, such as buildings or apartment, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person did not finish something, which implies that they did not complete it. To fail at completing something means that you did not get to the end or finish line of the task or project. The other options don't make sense in this context - winning, passing or doing well are more associated with competitions or tests, while succeeding is a more general term that could apply to achieving any sort of goal.
The sentence suggests that John prioritizes function over style, indicating that he values practicality and usefulness more than aesthetics. The options shapeless, change shape, and chaos all imply a lack of structure or organization, which does not align with the idea of valuing function. Quality could be a possible answer, but the sentence specifically states that form is less important than something else, suggesting that there is another factor that John values more highly than both form and quality.
The sentence suggests that when getting together with friends to watch a movie, the main purpose is to have a good time. The other options may also be relevant when watching a movie with friends, but the sentence specifically mentions "plenty of this," implying that having fun is the most important aspect.
A boutique is typically a small shop that specializes in unique or high-end products, and is often located in a group of similar shops in a shopping district or neighborhood. A supermarket, on the other hand, is a large retail store that offers a wide range of groceries and household goods. Therefore, a boutique would be an unlikely location for a supermarket to be found, while strip malls, shopping centers, cities or towns, and even some states, such as Vermont, are more likely to have a supermarket.
The sentence mentions Bill putting meat on a scale, which suggests that he is working in a place where meat is being sold or prepared. The only option that fits this description is a butcher shop, where meat is typically weighed and sold. The other options do not have any relevance to the context of the sentence.
Bowls are commonly used for serving food as they provide a convenient and easy-to-use container that can hold a variety of food items. A zoo is not related to serving food, a pan is used for cooking not serving, a kitchen is a room, and a spoon is used for eating food, not serving it.
The phrase "at the starting line" suggests that the question is referring to a race or a running competition. When racers are at the starting line, they typically stand still to prepare themselves mentally and physically for the race. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The phrase "bored of their roles" implies that the actor is looking for something new or different to do. "Branch out" means to try new things or explore different areas, which would be a good choice for an actor looking for a change. "Mask," "wear costume," and "pretend" all suggest aspects of acting that might be part of a role, but they do not address the actor's boredom. "Sing songs" could be a possible activity for an actor, but it does not necessarily address the issue of boredom.
The opposite of immortality is mortality, which means the state of being subject to death. Therefore, the correct answer is "mortal." The other options either describe a process of dying or being dead, which is not the same as simply not having immortality.
The sentence suggests that the person is having difficulty chewing food, which may be due to a physical discomfort in the mouth or jaw area. A broken jaw or sore mouth are common reasons for difficulty chewing food, while good digestion and avoiding choking are not directly related to the physical act of chewing. Eating is a general statement that does not provide a reason for the difficulty in chewing.
The sentence suggests that the person is a part of a large musical group where everyone wears tuxedos while playing keyboard instruments. This is a common practice in orchestras, where the musicians often wear formal attire during performances. The other options, such as music store or piano store, do not involve large musical groups with formal dress codes.
This question is asking for the location where the most amount of leaves can be found. Forests are known for having the highest concentration of trees, which are the primary source of leaves. In contrast, floral arrangements are typically made up of a few selected flowers and do not have a significant amount of leaves. The ground and fields may have some fallen leaves, but not as much as a forest. Compost piles are man-made and only have a specific amount of leaves depending on how much has been added.
Zoos are known for providing opportunities for children to interact with animals in a safe and controlled environment. A meadow and surface of the earth could be vague or potentially dangerous options for children to interact with animals. A playroom is typically a contained indoor space for children to play with toys and not animals. Fairgrounds may have animal exhibits, but not necessarily opportunities for children to play with animals.
The idea of talking animals is most commonly found in children's stories, as they are intended to be imaginative and entertaining for young readers. Weasels are a common animal character in children's stories, often depicted as cunning and mischievous. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the bald eagle has a specific status, and it is related to being given something. The keyword that helps solve the question is "protection." This suggests that the status of the bald eagle is related to conservation efforts to protect the species from harm. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, with "colorado" being a state and "world" and "outside" being too vague. "America" could have been a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
The question implies that taking a quick rest during the day has a specific purpose, which is related to feeling more energetic. This suggests that people take breaks in order to recharge their energy levels and be more productive or alert. The other options do not offer a clear explanation for why someone would need to take a quick rest during the day.
Running requires physical exertion, and eventually, the body will reach a point where it can no longer continue due to exhaustion. This makes exhaustion the most likely answer for what could suddenly stop someone when running. Mushrooms and sweating are not physical barriers that could stop someone, and falling down and getting tired are more gradual processes and less likely to happen suddenly.
Monkeys are commonly found in the wild in many parts of the world, but Thailand is known for having a large number of primate species, including gibbons, macaques, and langurs. The other options listed may contain monkeys, but they are all locations where the animals are most likely in captivity or have been removed from their natural habitat.
Sloths are known to be arboreal animals, meaning they spend most of their time living in trees. Therefore, it would be logical for them to live in a habitat that provides a lot of trees, such as a tropical jungle. The other options, such as "manual," "work," and "transit" do not relate to the natural habitat of sloths. While some sloths may live in the countryside, this option is not specific enough as a habitat for them.
Golf is a sport that requires the use of clubs to hit a ball into a hole, so it is likely that the gentleman is carrying a golf club. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Courtyards are typically enclosed outdoor spaces within the confines of a building or house. They are often characterized by a paved or gravel surface and feature plants and other outdoor decor. Lawns are not typically associated with courtyards because they require large open spaces and regular maintenance. Therefore, if you have a courtyard, you are likely to have less lawn and therefore less lawn care. The other options are not related to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the person had trouble understanding the computer while in a store, so they sought out a way to learn more. A demonstration, where someone shows the functions and features of a product, would be a logical option for someone looking to learn more about a computer. The other options, such as a classroom, Facebook, school, or apartment, do not necessarily relate to learning about computer technology specifically.
The sentence suggests that buying a used car is a risky decision, but there is still a hope that the car will perform well over a long period of time. The option "go fast" is not relevant as the focus is on the longevity of the car, not its speed. "Start running" is not specific enough as all cars should start running if they are in good condition. "Going too fast" is not desirable as it suggests the car may have performance issues. "Look good" is subjective and does not relate to the car's performance.
The sentence states that Dan was sitting quietly with a book in his hand, which indicates that he was most likely reading. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The primary purpose of cars is transportation, which means moving people from one place to another. Costing money is a secondary aspect of owning a car, but not its primary purpose. Slowing down is a function of the car's brakes, which are designed to control its speed, but it is not the main purpose of the vehicle. Turning right is a maneuver that the car is capable of doing, but it is not its main purpose. Lastly, getting girls is not a function of cars; it is a subjective opinion or stereotype that does not relate to the actual purpose of a vehicle.
The word "citizens" suggests that the question is asking about nationality or political affiliation. Alabama being a state within the United States, it is logical that the citizens of Alabama would also be citizens of the United States. The other options do not accurately describe the legal or political status of Alabama's people.
The sentence suggests that the campaign was aimed at creating awareness of a problem in order to have an effect on it. The most logical effect of a campaign to create awareness of a problem would be to reduce the problem's impact or prevalence. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Airplanes typically slow down as they approach the airport and prepare to land at the gate. This is a common procedure in aviation, as it allows the pilot to safely maneuver the aircraft onto the runway and land smoothly at the designated gate. While airplanes do carry people and may speed up during takeoff, it is highly unlikely for them to crash as they arrive at the gate.
The sentence suggests that the person with mental illness had been receiving treatment, so if they stop, there is a chance the illness might return or recur. Mental illnesses are often chronic conditions that require ongoing treatment to manage symptoms. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, and some are even unrelated to mental illness.
The adjective "gimmicky" suggests that the TV show was exaggerated or over-the-top in some way. Given the context of the sentence, it is likely that the show featured animals behaving in a sensational or exaggerated way. The words "sick," "mammals," and "males" do not provide any clear information about what the show was about, whereas "bite" and "attack" suggest that the show may have focused on aggressive or predatory animal behavior. In this case, "bite" is the better choice because it is less extreme than "attack" and more likely to be associated with sensational or gimmicky TV programming.
The sentence suggests that the subject of the sentence is a noisy machine that may be disruptive. The context of the sentence mentions that this type of machine is expected, which suggests that it is in a location where loud machines are common. Industrial areas, such as factories or manufacturing plants, are known for having loud and noisy equipment, which makes it the most likely choice out of the options provided. The other choices do not typically have loud machinery, and in fact, quiet and peaceful environments such as a museum, house, or library would likely oppose the presence of loud machines.
The question is asking where a ruler should be placed on a table. A ruler is typically used for measuring objects or distances, and it would be most useful when placed on a flat surface. The only option that refers to a flat surface is "desk," which is typically a flat work surface. The other options such as "drawer" or "the backside" do not make sense in the context of the question. "Office" is too broad of a category and "measure distance" is not a location.
The question suggests that there may be a negative consequence associated with kissing for too long, and one possible consequence of prolonged kissing could be shortness of breath, particularly if the individuals involved are not taking breaks to catch their breath. The other options either do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or have a more positive connotation (e.g. strong feelings, excitement, arousal). Herpes may be a consequence of kissing if one of the participants has an active outbreak of the virus, but this would not necessarily be a result of kissing for too long.
The other options, sky, house, match, and candle are not typically sources of light in a modern living room. A lamp is a common and expected light source in a modern living room.
The sentence suggests that the person saw a mess caused by their children, which is likely to provoke a negative emotional response. Of the given choices, "look angry" is the most appropriate response to seeing a mess caused by children, as it indicates frustration or annoyance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Ray Charles was a blind musician who often wore dark glasses indoors, likely to help with his sensitivity to light due to his blindness. The other choices do not have any connection to the idea of wearing sunglasses indoors.
The question implies that there are certain places where stones are commonly arranged in a path, and the correct answer is where they would not be arranged in a path. Quarries are places where stones are mined, so it doesn't make sense to arrange stones in a path there. The other options could potentially have paths made of stones or rocks, making them incorrect answers.
Bald eagles are often used as a symbol of patriotism in art and are commonly depicted in paintings. They may also be found in sculptures and carvings. While they are native to Canada and can be found in rural areas and aviaries, these options do not specifically relate to the context of the question. The mention of a "work" suggests that the answer should relate to some sort of creative endeavor or representation.
The sentence implies that the hostess was friendly and hospitable, which is often associated with welcoming guests. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Group people" and "work room" do not make sense in the context of a hostess's job, and "ready parlor for guests" is too specific and not necessarily indicative of good performance. "Park" is also unrelated to the context.
Learning is a process of gaining knowledge and skills, which leads to an increase in one's understanding of a particular subject or topic. As an individual learns, they are likely to acquire more knowledge and become more knowledgeable about that subject or topic. Therefore, the correct answer is "knowing more." "Overconfidence" is not a likely outcome of learning, as learning often involves recognizing one's limitations and areas for improvement. "Effectiveness" and "growth" may be outcomes of learning, but they are not as directly related to the process of learning itself. "Head grows larger" is not a likely outcome of learning in any way.
The sentence suggests that the inspector was agreeing with the protocols of the factory, which implies that the factory was following some sort of rules or regulations. The word "compliance" means following rules or regulations, so it is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person experienced an issue with their body after standing up. Since the person had to sit right back down, it can be assumed that the problem was serious enough to prevent them from standing for longer periods of time. Muscles often play a crucial role in our ability to stand up and maintain our posture, so it is likely that the person's muscles were involved in some way. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a typical sequence of activities for a night out, and is looking for the location where one might go before going to a bar. A common choice for pre-bar activities is a nightclub, as they often have a lively atmosphere and can be a good place to socialize and dance. The other options (city, park, etc.) do not fit the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the dad had a gun at home and wanted to use it to protect his house. The most likely place to store a gun in a home would be a secure drawer, as it would be easily accessible to the owner but not to potential intruders. The other options (police station, crime scene, restroom, and holster) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the instrument can be played with an "air of happiness," which implies that it is commonly associated with upbeat, cheerful music. The fiddle is a stringed instrument commonly used in folk and country music, which often has a lively, joyful sound. Jumping up and down and playing games are not musical instruments, while singing can be done in a variety of moods and styles, making the fiddle the most likely correct answer.
The word "ramp" is a clue that suggests an activity related to skateboarding, as ramps are commonly used in skateboarding. The other options (watch film, fire game, hang out at bar, go skiing) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not involve the use of a ramp.
The sentence indicates that the animal being described has quills all over it, which is a defining characteristic of porcupines. While some birds have feathers and some people may use calligraphy pens, they do not have quills like porcupines do. Chickens do not have quills at all, and while hedgehogs do have spines, they are not the same as quills.
An office is typically a place where people go to work or conduct business. The other options, such as school building, paper, or city, may be associated with an office, but they do not directly answer the question of why someone would go to an office. Habit is also not a valid option, as it does not provide a specific reason for going to an office.
Digestion is a physiological process that requires a significant amount of energy and resources from the body. Eating during digestion can interrupt this process and lead to discomfort or even illness. Therefore, it is generally considered the worst time to have food. The other options do not necessarily relate to the timing of eating.
The sentence suggests that if you spend all your time buying and not saving, something negative is likely to happen. The phrase "go broke" is a common expression used to describe someone who has spent all their money and has no more left. Therefore, it is the most logical choice among the options. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information given.
The sentence implies that a mouse might be found in places other than a house. While a mouse may prefer a house for shelter and food, they are also known to inhabit other areas, such as gardens, where they can find food and build nests. The other options, such as tin or cupboard, do not provide a suitable habitat for a mouse.
The sentence suggests that the activity in question is a type of performance. "Acting" is the only choice that directly matches this context. "Singing" and "smiling" are not types of performance, while "feat" is too general and does not specifically relate to performance. "Act" could also be a possible answer, but "acting" is a more specific and accurate choice.
The sentence indicates that the car was traveling from Alabama to New York, which suggests that its overall direction was northward. Therefore, the correct answer is "heading north". "Speed up" and "go fast" are actions that relate to how the car is driving rather than its destination. "Headed south" is the opposite direction of the car's stated route.
The word "trash" refers to waste materials that are typically thrown away, and "dustbin" is a term commonly used in Australia to refer to a container for holding such waste. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, and are unlikely to be correct answers. "Dirt" refers to soil or earth, "subway" is a type of public transportation system, "state park" is a protected natural area, and "container" is a general term that could refer to any type of object used for holding things.
Potatoes are typically cooked by boiling, baking, or frying. Boiling is a common method and involves placing the potato in a pot of boiling water until it is cooked through. The other options do not make sense in the context of cooking a potato. Placing a potato in a paper bag, restaurants, underground, or a cupboard will not cook the potato.
The sentence suggests that there is a connection between a writer's ability and their financial success. The word "fortune" implies wealth or financial gain. The option "imagination" aligns with this idea as it suggests that writers who are able to come up with innovative and creative ideas can stand out in the competitive field of writing and potentially earn a substantial income. The other options, such as "cookie" and "real estate," have no clear association with the context of the sentence. "Bank" and "bankroll" are related to finances but do not specifically tie into the concept of a writer's success.
The question is asking for a general location where animals live, which is the surface of the earth. The moon and fairgrounds are not habitable for most animals, meadow only refers to a specific type of environment, and zoos are artificial environments created by humans to house certain animals.
The word "homeless shelter" suggests that the living conditions are likely to be less than ideal. Homelessness often involves situations of poverty, insecurity, and limited access to resources such as food, clothing, and healthcare. While it is possible that some residents may be able to find happiness or improve their quality of life while in a shelter, the phrase "sometimes bad" is a more likely interpretation of the question. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the question.
The verb "to do" suggests that knitting is an activity that can be done to achieve a certain feeling. The word "relaxation" is often associated with activities that are calming and enjoyable, and many people turn to knitting as a way to unwind and reduce stress. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Arthritis" is a medical condition that is not typically linked to knitting, while "adrenaline" suggests excitement and is not related to the calm and creative nature of knitting. The last option, "your sweater may produced" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "conference" is often associated with large tables because they are commonly used in meeting rooms or conference rooms where many people need to sit and work together. The other options, such as "dining room," "kitchen," "in a lake," and "demonstration," do not necessarily suggest the need for a very large table.
The sentence implies that John received a sum of money he wasn't expecting and was excited about it. The phrase "treated it like it was" suggests that John had a positive attitude towards the money and saw it as a bonus, rather than something he earned or worked for. The phrase "tax refund" also implies that the money was returned to John from the government as a form of reimbursement, rather than from a job or investment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Allergies can cause a range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes, and nasal congestion. Sneezing is a common symptom that occurs when the body tries to expel irritants from the nose and throat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with allergies.
Ferrets are land animals and usually not found in water habitats like aquariums. The other options, classroom and outdoors, are possible locations for ferrets, while North Carolina and Great Britain are geographic locations that are irrelevant to the context of the question.
This question implies that jumping into any ocean will result in a certain outcome. The most obvious outcome is getting wet because oceans are made up of water. The other answer choices, such as "tanned" or "fish," do not make sense in this context and are not related to the act of jumping into an ocean. "Wide" and "very deep" may be characteristics of some oceans, but they are not outcomes of jumping into them.
The sentence suggests that the person has just finished urinating, indicating that their bladder is now empty. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence; a collapsed or stretchable bladder would indicate a medical issue, and a full or filled bladder would imply that the person had not just gone to the bathroom.
The sentence suggests that the lady has mental issues relating to overeating, which can lead to bulimia, a disorder characterized by binge-eating followed by purging or inducing vomiting. The phrase "make herself" in the sentence implies that the lady is intentionally causing herself to vomit, further supporting the idea of bulimia. The other options, such as washing dishes or turning inside out, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that a car was summoned to take someone to the opera house, indicating that the destination is the main focus of the sentence. The other options do not describe a specific location, action, or characteristic associated with an opera house.
The question is asking about live entertainment, which typically refers to performances that are experienced in real-time, rather than through a recorded medium like a movie. While concerts and theaters also offer live entertainment, the word "show" specifically refers to a performance that is staged for an audience, such as a musical or a play. Casinos and concert venues may offer live entertainment as well, but the focus of the question is on what type of performance someone would attend for entertainment purposes.
The sentence suggests that the teacher is discussing whether or not a ferret would make a good pet in a specific setting, which is a classroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the word "entire" implies that the teacher is considering the suitability of a ferret as a pet for a group of people, rather than an individual.
Creeks are typically found in low-lying areas, such as valleys. Valleys are known for their low elevation, often surrounded by mountains or hills, and contain numerous waterways, including creeks. Forests, outdoors, countryside, and woods may contain creeks, but they are not exclusive to those environments, whereas valleys are more commonly associated with creeks.
Most pet birds are kept in cages for their safety and security. The other options do not provide a suitable living environment for a pet bird. Forests and countryside are habitats for wild birds, not pet birds. Bathrooms and windowsills are not safe places for birds to live as they may be exposed to harmful cleaning products or fall from a height.
The sentence suggests that Joe and Mac played basketball every day in their backyard, indicating that they enjoyed the activity. The phrase "have fun" directly relates to the idea of enjoying an activity. The other options, such as "study" or "knee injury," do not fit the context of the sentence and would not explain why Joe and Mac were playing basketball in their backyard on a daily basis.
A nomad is typically defined as someone who moves from place to place without having a permanent home. This implies that they do not have a fixed residence or dwelling, which is the characteristic that separates nomads from individuals who have a home. The other options do not have any clear connection to the definition of the term "nomad".
The question asks for a treat that a dog will enjoy, and a bone is commonly considered a favored treat for dogs. Salad and affection are not typically given as treats to dogs, and while petting and attention are important for a dog's well-being, they are not considered treats.
The sentence suggests that there has been a change in what is considered acceptable attire for women. The options "man suit," "naked," "action," and "long skirt" are not seen as common attire for women, whereas "pants" are now widely accepted as a choice for women's clothing. This indicates that the correct answer is "pants."
The sentence suggests that Joe was able to memorize a list despite being in a certain state, implying that there was some sort of obstacle to his ability to memorize. The option "concentrate" makes sense as it implies that Joe's ability to focus was intact despite his apparent state. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence - "awake" is too general, "repeat" doesn't make sense as memorizing involves repetition, "sleeping" seems unlikely, and "read aloud" is unrelated.
The sentence suggests that being wet can lead to a negative consequence, such as catching a cold. It is well-known that exposure to cold and wet conditions can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of getting sick. Crossing the street, gaining weight, thanking god, and committing suicide do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the patient recovered from a particular disease, and the doctor likely assessed the patient's condition after recovery. "Healthy," "cure," and "wellness" all suggest a positive outcome of the patient's recovery, while "passing around" does not relate to the context and seems out of place. "Healthy" appears twice in the choices, but since it is the most appropriate option, it should be selected as the answer.
The use of tape to create clean lines suggests that the painter is working on a geometric shape. A triangle is a shape that often requires precise and clean lines, making it a likely choice for this situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A tide pool is a rocky pool on the coast that is filled with water at high tide and becomes exposed at low tide. Sea anemones are often found in tide pools because they can tolerate changing water levels and temperatures. The other options are not typically associated with sea creatures or coastal environments. The nursery may refer to a fish or shellfish hatchery, the museum would be a place to view preserved specimens, and the Gulf of Mexico is a large body of water, none of which would be likely locations to find a sea anemone after high tide.
The word "wreak" implies a negative outcome or harm being done. When a car collides with a pedestrian, it can cause serious injury or even death. The other options (say hello, pollution, smoke, relaxation) do not accurately describe the potential consequences of a driving car coming into contact with a pedestrian.
The sentence suggests that the person is stuck at home and looking for a way to alleviate boredom. Playing cards or skateboarding would require leaving the house, so those options can be ruled out. Meeting interesting people would also require leaving the house, and it's not a guaranteed way to alleviate boredom. Going to a concert is an option, but if the person can't leave the house, then it's not feasible. Listening to music, however, can easily be done at home and is a common way to pass the time when bored.
The context of the sentence suggests that the grocery clerk would put the individual potato in a container or bag for the customer to take home. Paper bags are a common option for packaging individual produce items at grocery stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are unrelated to packaging or storing fresh produce.
The sentence suggests that a rubber bath mat is typically found in a specific room in a house. From the choices given, only the bathroom is a common location for a bath mat, as it prevents slips and falls on wet bathroom floors. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the tool or device that is typically used to cook meat by placing it on top. Of the options given, the frying pan is the only one that is commonly used for this purpose. Oil is often used as a cooking ingredient, but is not specifically used to cook meat on top of. The freezer is used for storing food, the ham sandwich is not a cooking device, and while the oven may be used to cook meat, it typically involves placing the meat inside the oven, rather than on top of it.
The sentence suggests that the person mentioned does not consume leafy greens, which are a common source of minerals. Therefore, the best option for obtaining minerals would be through a multivitamin, which contains a variety of essential vitamins and minerals. The other options, such as farm, Michigan, earth or ore, do not provide any clear connection to obtaining minerals.
The sentence suggests that after cashing in, there is some sort of action that could be taken. "Getting paid" and "receiving money" could both refer to the act of cashing in, rather than something that happens after. "Selling out" doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the only logical choice is "spending money" as that is a common action that occurs after someone has cash in hand. "Happy" could be an emotional response, but it is not a concrete action that one would take.
The sentence implies that the smelly man is taking a bath to improve his hygiene and eliminate unpleasant body odors, which is a common pursuit of personal cleanliness. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - hydration and use of water suggest that the man is trying to quench his thirst, being clear and will drown are not related to hygiene at all.
The sentence suggests that the couple is considering ending their marriage, which typically involves a lot of conflict and disagreement. Fighting is a common occurrence during this process and is often a source of stress and emotional upheaval. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about the motivation for working a lot, and the most common reason for doing so is to earn more money. While some people might work hard to attain other goals like owning a house or a car, the context of the question suggests that the primary purpose is to increase income. Creativity and caregiving are not related to the topic of earning.
The sentence suggests that the traveling business man's credit card had perks that helped to offset the high prices of travel. Since the sentence also mentions an airport specifically, it's reasonable to assume that the high prices being referred to are related to air travel. The other options - car, theatre, hotel, and Disneyland - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy prefers using his own bathroom when he needs to defecate. This implies that Billy has a bathroom in his own home, and therefore the correct answer would be "house." The other options, such as a motel room or nearest public restroom, would not be specific to Billy's personal preference for using only his own bathroom.
The sentence suggests that the forest experienced a cold winter, which is a common characteristic of areas located in the temperate zone. The temperate zone is an area located between the tropics and the polar regions, and typically experiences four distinct seasons, including cold winters. The other options do not provide any clues as to the location of the forest.
The question is asking for a non-violent way to express anger. "Release energy" and "punch" both suggest physical violence, while "lose your temper" suggests a lack of control. "Destroy enemy" is not a healthy or appropriate response to anger. "Write letter" is a constructive way to communicate feelings and thoughts without physically harming someone. Therefore, the correct answer is "write letter."
Brownstones are townhouses or row houses that are typically made of brown sandstone, and they are a common architectural style in New York City. The phrase "brownstone" is often used as a shorthand for neighborhoods in NYC that are known for their brownstone buildings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a surface on which to place a telephone, and "desktop" is a common surface for telephones in both home and office environments. "Bar" and "party" do not generally have surfaces suitable for holding telephones, whereas "friend's house" is too broad and could vary depending on the specific friend and their living space. "Office" is a possible answer, but "desktop" is more specific and directly relates to the question of where to place a telephone.
Dard is a language spoken in regions of Iran, so it is likely that someone from Iran would use this language type. The other options have no clear connection to language or Iran. Books and television may be used to learn or consume languages, but they do not specify a particular language type. Sky and closed room have no relevance to language at all.
The sentence implies that John went to a party that lasted all night, which suggests that he was busy during the entirety of the event. The fact that he didn't have time for something implies that he wanted to do it, but couldn't because he was at the party. The option "stay home" is the best fit for this context because it suggests that John wanted to stay home but didn't have time to do so because he was at the party all night. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
Since the child is not allowed in the kitchen, it is unlikely that they can cook or prepare food. However, setting the table is a task that can be done in the dining room and would be helpful for mealtime. The other options don't seem relevant to the context of the sentence - forming opinions, making honey, becoming an adult, and gathering flowers don't have anything to do with helping out in the dining room.
The sentence suggests that the person is struggling with expressing themselves in a healthy way, which indicates some sort of emotional or psychological difficulty. The psychologist's assessment that the person is "mentally" something further supports this idea, as it suggests a deeper, internal issue. "Slow" and "fun" do not fit the context of the sentence, while "understood" and "embarrassment" are possible interpretations, they do not fully capture the severity or implication of the psychologist's assessment. "Suffering" is the most appropriate option given the context.
The sentence suggests that physical competition has some effect on the body. The phrase "perform better" implies that the body responds positively to physical competition, perhaps by increasing adrenaline or releasing endorphins. The other options also describe physical responses to competition, but they do not necessarily imply an improvement in performance. Tension could lead to decreased performance, winning or losing is a result of competition rather than a physical response, and sweating and releasing heat are more automatic bodily functions than intentional responses.
Deaf people rely on visual communication, so writing down information is an effective way to ensure they can receive and understand it. Summarizing main points may also be helpful, but it may not include all the necessary details. Closing one's mouth or talking will not be effective since the deaf person cannot hear. Saying "may disagree" does not provide a clear method for communication.
The sentence suggests that printing on a printer can be expensive, and one reason for this is that it uses up paper. Each time a document is printed, it requires a sheet of paper, which can quickly add up if a large number of documents are printed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "explode" and "noise" are completely unrelated, "store information" doesn't impact the cost of printing, and "queue" refers to the process of waiting in line, which has no bearing on the cost of printing.
According to some religious beliefs, God is considered all-powerful and all-knowing, which means that there is nothing that God cannot do. Therefore, the statement that God will never do anything is often interpreted as a way of emphasizing God's unlimited power and omnipotence. The other options may not be accurate as they suggest limitations on God's actions or attributes that are not universally agreed upon in all religions.
The sentence suggests that there is a potential danger associated with attending school, which is commonly known as a place where students may catch colds and flu due to being in close contact with other people. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence or do not pose a significant danger to students.
A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, giving it a surface with many sides. The other options do not fit the definition of having a surface with multiple sides - an object can be any shape, a geometry problem is an abstract concept and not a physical object, a lake has a surface but it's not made up of sides or faces, and a triangle has three sides but is a two-dimensional shape.
A cargo ship is a large vessel designed to transport goods (containers) from one place to another. This is its primary function and is directly related to the question. The other options such as food, refrigerator, port or fuel are not vessels or means of transportation, making the answer clear.
The sentence suggests that the old style pop-ups were a feature of books and that they allowed the reader to see the story in some way. The phrase "literally let you see the story" implies that the pop-ups created a visual representation of the plot or characters. The option "open book" is the only one that specifically relates to this idea, as the other choices do not have a clear connection to books or visual storytelling.
The act of talking to someone is generally referred to as communication. Communication is the process of transferring information from one person to another through various means, including speaking, writing, and gesturing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the family just finished dinner and now it's time to clean up. The most common place to clean dishes after dinner is in a dishwasher. The other options do not make logical sense, as a restaurant kitchen and party would not be where the family's dirty dishes would go, and loading the dishes in the son's room or cabinet would not be an appropriate chore after dinner.
The reference to politicians and a bureau suggests a location where government officials and agencies are located. French government could be an option, but there is a specific reference to a particular place, which is not the case with the generic term "each city." The zoo and office building are completely unrelated and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the dad wanted to hide a check in his office, which implies that the dad intended to keep the check safe and secure. The most logical place to keep a valuable object like a check would be in a locked desk drawer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person in question has difficulty experiencing regular emotions, and therefore turns to buying products as a way to feel something. The option "pleasure" is the most fitting word to describe the feeling that someone might get from purchasing products. The other options, such as "owning" or "debt," do not make sense as a way to replace emotions or provide an outlet for feelings. The option "smart" may suggest a feeling of satisfaction or accomplishment from making a savvy purchase, but it does not fit with the context of the sentence.
Horses are often judged on their appearance at fairs, which are events where livestock are shown and judged based on their conformation, appearance, and other criteria. Race tracks are primarily used for horse racing and not for judging horses on their appearance. Horses raised by humans and those in fields may not necessarily be judged on their appearance. The countryside does not provide a clear indication of where horses are judged on their appearance.
Non-fiction is typically written to inform or educate the reader on a specific topic, making it an ideal choice for those who want to expand their knowledge on a subject. Non-fiction books may cover a wide range of topics, from history and science to self-help and biographies. While some non-fiction books may be enjoyable to read, the primary reason people typically choose to read non-fiction is to acquire new information or skills. The other options listed are not commonly associated with reading non-fiction.
itting is a relatively quiet and stationary activity, so it makes sense that a radio can be used to provide some background noise or entertainment while doing it. The other options don't seem as suitable for this context - watching TV, eating, or making blankets may require more attention and movement, and the sentence already mentions "knitting" so it's unlikely that the correct answer involves a different activity.
This question is asking where papers are commonly placed while working on them, and the most logical answer is a table. Tables provide a flat surface to work on and are commonly found in homes and offices. A meeting, drawer, toilet, or garage are not typically used for working on papers, making them unlikely answers.
The sentence sets up a comparison between John's debt of 50 million dollars and Leo's debt of 2000 dollars, implying that there is a significant difference in scale between the two. The word "massive" further emphasizes the size of John's debt, making the other options - "dwarf," "inconsequential," "insubstantial," and "lame" - inappropriate choices. "Tiny" accurately conveys the sense of insignificance of Leo's debt compared to John's.
The sentence indicates that the man saw pollution in the sky while flying his airplane over the city. The other options are not likely to be associated with pollution in the sky. Forests and streets are typically associated with ground-level pollution, and car shows are usually a type of event rather than a source of pollution. The phrase "caused by humans" is too general to be a specific answer to the question.
Becoming inebriated (i.e. drunk) can result in various side effects such as fights, drunkenness, staggering, and puking. However, paralysis is a highly unlikely side effect and does not have any clear connection to alcohol consumption. It is therefore the correct answer to the question.
The question asks about communication with a boss, which suggests that the focus should be on exchanging information or ideas. The phrase "transfer of information" directly refers to the act of conveying information from one person to another, making it the most appropriate choice. "Misunderstandings" and "confusion" suggest a breakdown in communication, while "learning" may not have a clear connection to the situation. "Silence" is not a proactive approach to communication and will not help in achieving the desired outcome.
The sentence implies that the location being discussed is a market, and the question is asking where fish can be found in that market. The other options (stream, aquarium, boat ride) are locations where one might find fish, but they are not appropriate answers to the question being asked. The answer is therefore the option that is explicitly mentioned in the question.
While owning land or a home, talking to each other, and believing in god may all be activities that people do with friends, spending time is a more general choice that encompasses many possibilities. Spending time may include going to the movies, playing games, going out to eat, or any number of other social activities that people do with their friends. The other options are more specific and do not apply to all types of friendships or social situations.
The sentence suggests that there is a dangerous situation involving sharks and tornadoes. It is logical to assume that being outdoors would put one at greater risk of encountering the shark-filled tornado. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Buying products in excess means purchasing more than what is needed, which will eventually result in using up all the available funds, leading to a shortage of money. This can lead to financial strains and difficulties paying for necessities. Spending money is not a likely result because it is a given that money will be spent when buying products. Poverty is a possible outcome, but it is too extreme and not necessarily a direct result of buying products in excess. Comparison shopping is a strategy used to save money while overstocking is the opposite of buying products in excess.
Analgesics are medicines used to relieve pain. The context of the sentence implies that the person is taking these medicines in order to achieve a certain goal, which can be inferred from the choices given. Acceptance, acknowledgment, passing grade, and intellectual challenge do not relate to the purpose of taking analgesics, while avoiding pain is a common reason for taking them.
After drinking from a glass, one would typically place it in a location for cleaning or storage. The options "ocean" and "water cooler" do not make sense in this context, as they are not places for glassware. "Dining room" could be a possible location, but it is not specific enough. "Dishwasher" and "cabinet" are commonly used places to store or clean glassware after use, making them the most likely answers.
The word "buy" suggests that the question is related to purchasing food, which is typically done at a store. The other options are not relevant to buying food - a freezer is a storage device, home is a location, hatred is an emotion, and a kitchen is a room in a home where food is prepared.
Admitting one's mistakes is a responsible behavior as it shows an individual is willing to take ownership of their actions and their consequences. The other options do not fit into the context of admitting one's mistakes. An accident is an unforeseeable event, learning to swim is unrelated to admitting mistakes, thanking God may show gratitude but does not relate to taking responsibility, and feeling relieved may only be a byproduct of admitting mistakes, not the purpose behind it.
Playing games for money is a common practice in casinos, which are establishments that offer various forms of gambling activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are either related to sports, leisure, or entertainment but not to gambling.
The question is asking what you should do in case of unexpected costs when traveling. The only logical answer is to have money readily available to cover those costs. Going somewhere, energy, and flying in an airplane are not relevant to the question, and spending frivolously could actually cause more financial trouble in the long run. Having money is the most practical and responsible option for dealing with unexpected expenses while traveling.
The sentence suggests that Donald is a prominent figure for the federal government, which is primarily based in Washington D.C. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the bums were asking for change or a ticket, which implies that they were trying to travel by public transportation. The cheapest way to travel by public transportation is often by bus, so it makes sense that the sight of beggars asking for change or a ticket would be common at a bus depot. The other options, such as a train station or a beach, do not have the same connection to public transportation or the idea of traveling on a budget.
The sentence indicates that Joe was hit by a ball and fell down while he and John were playing planning games. It is reasonable to assume that an injury occurred, given that the context refers to a physical activity and a sudden fall. The other options do not provide a likely explanation for Joe's situation.
The phrase "indoor merchants" suggests that the location being described is a place where multiple vendors sell their products under one roof. A common example of such a location is a shopping mall. Additionally, the option "gap" is a specific brand of clothing, and the options "bedroom" and "bathroom" are private spaces unlikely to have multiple jeans vendors. Only "shopping mall" fits the given context.
The question is asking about the physical object that is used to send a letter in America. A common item used for this purpose is an envelope, which is a folded piece of paper or other material used to enclose and protect the letter inside. The other options are not related to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Joe owes taxes, specifically "back" taxes and another type of tax. The word "current" means ongoing, so it makes sense that Joe would owe current taxes in addition to the ones he owes from the past (back taxes). The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of taxes owed.
A broadcast studio is a place where radio or TV shows are produced and recorded. Therefore, it is likely to be heard on a radio station or seen on a TV channel. A microphone is a device used for capturing sound, but it is not necessarily associated with the location where the sound is transmitted. An arena is a large venue where sports or entertainment events are held and is not commonly associated with broadcasting. Trees and town are also not related to the concept of broadcasting.
A self-referential book is a book that refers to itself or the act of reading/writing a book. A coffee table book is typically defined as a large, visually appealing book meant to be displayed on a coffee table for guests to browse through. This could potentially be the type of book that Kramer wrote as it would be a good fit for a self-referential theme. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy's mother has some concerns about football as a sport, which is often associated with violent tackles and injuries. The context implies that the mother may not find football to be a safe or appropriate activity for her son. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for the city that is likely to have many parking structures. Based on general knowledge, larger cities with dense populations and limited space for parking, like Chicago, are more likely to have a higher number of parking structures. The other options do not provide any information that suggests they would have a higher number of parking structures.
The sentence suggests that Sally has a fear of danger and actively takes steps to avoid it. The options "fight enemy" and "vicinity" do not fit with the idea of avoiding danger, while "secure" is too broad and could refer to many different things. "Being safe" and "safety" both directly relate to the sense of safety and avoiding danger, making them the most likely correct answer options.
Foxes are known for living in burrows or dens, which they dig themselves or take over from other animals. This is a common trait among many species of foxes and is essential to their survival as it provides protection from predators and harsh weather. The other options, such as hen house, California, England, and mountains, do not match the typical habitat of foxes.
The sentence suggests that there is something that sets humans apart from animals, and this something has allowed them to become dominant on the planet. The options "eat eggs," "eat dosa," and "smoke pot" have no obvious connection to the sentence. "Talk to each other" may be a possibility, but the tone of the sentence suggests that the thing that sets humans apart is something more concrete. "Make tools" is a common characteristic cited by anthropologists and historians as the factor that allowed humans to develop and dominate over other species.
The sentence suggests that the family enjoyed having a backyard in a specific type of area that was safe. Suburbs and neighborhoods are commonly associated with having safe environments for families, while "back of house" and "roundabout" do not make sense in this context. "Property" could work, but it does not specify the type of area or neighborhood they are in.
The sentence implies that the object in question was originally used for something other than collecting coins. The phrase "pail to be lowered" suggests that the object was used for retrieving something from a deep location. A wishing well fits this description as people could throw coins in it to make a wish and the coins would be retrieved from the bottom using a pail on a rope. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Joe was in a body of water and there was a crew with him. The fact that Joe cried out for help implies that there was some sort of noise or disturbance going on. The sentence also mentions it was the middle of winter, which indicates that there may have been some weather-related conditions affecting the situation. The option "motor" is the most likely answer as it could be creating noise and disturbance in the water, making it difficult for Joe's cries for help to be heard. The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The term "earning money" typically refers to someone working and receiving payment for their job. Therefore, the correct answer is likely a location associated with work. "Deep thought" and "park" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Friend's house" may be a location where someone spends leisure time, but it is unlikely to be related to earning money. "School" is a place where people may learn and develop skills, but it is not necessarily where they earn money.
The sentence suggests that they were on their way to watch a motorsport event, but they passed an apple tree, which indicates that they were not physically going to the event location. The only option that fits this context is "on tv", as it implies that they were going to watch the event from the comfort of their own home or another location, rather than actually attending it in person. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that people play chess on the weekends for a specific reason, and one that may not necessarily be related to having fun or seeking a thrilling experience. The word "satisfaction" suggests that the act of playing chess gives individuals a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment, which could be a motivating factor for why they choose to play on the weekends. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for the reason behind playing chess on weekends.
Gym class typically involves physical activity such as playing sports, running, and other exercises that require energy. The other options (work, tacos, mass, wrestle) do not match the expected activity in gym class and therefore are not likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Sarah dropped the marble intentionally, likely because she was playing a game. Dropping a marble could be part of a game that involves rolling and tossing marbles, but it is not likely related to the other options such as pouch, home, store, or jar.
The sentence implies that all humans share a common experience or fate, which is something that we all do or will do. The options "write," "eat cake," and "smile" do not reflect a universal experience or fate, while "think critically" may be too specific or subjective to apply universally. "Die" is a universal experience that all humans share, regardless of culture, language, or belief system.
Going to bed usually implies the intention of getting some rest and preparing to sleep. Therefore, the goal would be to fall asleep. The other options do not reflect a typical bedtime goal, as being lazy, having insomnia, or dreaming are not necessarily the intended outcomes of getting into bed.
The question asks about the purpose of candles and specifically asks about something that they eliminate. Candles are commonly used as a source of light, and they can be used to eliminate darkness in a room or area. The other options (shelf, board, church, table) do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A study is a room that is typically associated with reading and contemplation. It is common for a study to have many bookcases, as people often keep their collection of books in this room. The other options, such as house, home, kitchen, and den, do not offer any indication that they would be the room with many bookcases and used for contemplation.
Stars are located in outer space, which is the vast expanse beyond our planet Earth. Hollywood and eating cake have no relevance to traveling to a star, while the night sky and galaxy may contain stars but are not the specific location where one can travel to a star.
The sentence mentions a player lifting a cornet and walking in rhythm, which is indicative of musical performance. The options "museum" and "high school band" do not make sense in this context, as the former does not involve musical performance and the latter would likely have been mentioned specifically as a separate option. "Marching band" makes sense as a possible choice, as it involves playing instruments while walking in a synchronized manner. However, the use of the term "player" instead of "marcher" suggests that the sentence is referring to a more general type of musical group, which is why "band" and "orchestra" are both plausible options.
The question is asking about what happens immediately after a living being is born, and one of the most common things is that they start to grow and mature. This is supported by the fact that the other options (expiration, death, start reproduction) are events that occur later in the life cycle, while "sometimes bad" is too vague and does not make sense in this context.
Asking a question is a common and appropriate way to clarify information that was missed during a conversation. It indicates a desire for understanding and encourages the speaker to provide more information. Walking, thinking, and sneezing are not effective methods for requesting a repetition of information, and writing a question in crayon is not a realistic or appropriate option for most conversational situations.
The question refers to the storage of fabric in a personal or home setting. The most appropriate and common place to store fabric in a home would be a sewing room where someone has space to store and work with their materials. The other options may have fabric, but they are not typically places where one would store their personal fabric collection. A clothing store or clothes store would only have fabric for sale, and a tailor shop may have fabric but it would be primarily used for alterations or repairs. A cotton mill is a manufacturing facility for making fabric, not a place to store it in a personal setting.
The sentence is discussing what companies do not want to have "relative to demand," which suggests that the correct answer is related to the concept of supply and demand. Of the options given, "oversupply" is the only one directly related to the concept of having more of a product than is needed or desired, which is not desirable for companies as it can lead to waste and decreased profitability. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the person playing basketball is doing it for a long time, implying that they are likely enjoying themselves. The other options do not necessarily relate to the act of playing basketball specifically. Sweating and knee injury may occur during basketball, but they don't necessarily describe what's happening while the person is playing for a long time. Pain is too broad and can't be assumed without more information. Medium is unrelated and doesn't make sense in this context.
The sentence implies that the traveler was waiting for some form of public transportation when the rain caused their groceries to get soaked. The options "library," "motel," "airport," and "subway" do not fit this context because they do not typically have areas designated for waiting for public transportation. "Bus stop" is the only option that fits this context and would be a likely place for someone to wait for mass transit.
The phrase "physical distress" implies a medical emergency or injury that requires urgent attention. A hospital is a facility equipped to provide medical care and treatment for such situations, while the other options (synagogue, bus stop, building) are not specifically related to medical assistance. "For help" is too general and does not provide any specific information about the kind of help required, so it cannot be the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the cancer patient was preparing for the possibility of his death, which is often a time when people make out their will. Making out a will involves determining who will receive a person's possessions and assets after their death. The other options are either unrelated to the context of the sentence or inappropriate in this context.
The sentence suggests that the toll road is located in the northeastern region of the United States, which is commonly referred to as New England. The other choices are states or locations within the region, but do not provide a specific location for the toll road described.
The sentence suggests that if you stayed up partying all night, you may feel tired when you start work the next day. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cat is being cautious while moving through a potentially hazardous area. One common hazard that cats face is falling, especially if they are moving across narrow ledges or unstable surfaces. The other answer choices (getting wet, eating vegetables, wool sweater, sharp claws) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When someone is talking to another person, it is generally expected that the other person will be listening to what is being said. Listening involves actively paying attention to the words and meanings of the speaker, and it is a key component of successful communication. The other choices, such as "planning the perfect murder" or "language," do not relate to the expected behavior when someone is engaged in a conversation with another person.
The question suggests that the sky has a specific behavior that occurs before a rain. Clouding over refers to the process of clouds forming and thickening, which is often a precursor to rainfall. In contrast, the other options do not accurately describe the behavior of the sky before a rain. Appearing beautiful or blue are aesthetic descriptions, while showing a rainbow occurs during or after the rain. Rain water is a consequence of the rain, rather than a behavior of the sky.
The items listed in the question are all commonly found on a desktop, which is a surface where a person typically works or studies. The other options may also contain some of these items, but they do not necessarily indicate where all the listed items can be found. "University" implies a specific location, while "drawer" and "table" do not provide enough context to indicate where all the listed items can be found. "Work" is too general and does not specify a specific location.
Lizards are known to thrive in warm and dry climates, which is why they are commonly found in arid regions such as deserts. The other options (ball stopped, garden) do not have any clear connection to the habitat or environment that is suitable for lizards. West Texas and warm place are somewhat related, as West Texas is known for its hot and dry climate, but arid regions is a more specific and accurate answer.
The question asks about the tool used to carry a briefcase, and out of the given options, only "hand" is a viable choice. The other options are locations where one might bring a briefcase, but they do not answer the question being asked.
The sentence describes someone increasing their speed from walking to running, which suggests that the person wants to move quickly. The phrase "picked up his pace" implies a desire to increase speed, and "to a run" indicates that the person is running as fast as they can. The other options do not fit with the context of someone increasing their speed to a run.
This question is asking for a solution to a problem, which is not having any friends. The most logical solution would be to try to make new friends by talking to people. This option is the only one that presents a proactive solution to the problem. "Try again" is too vague and doesn't offer any specific action, while "fall asleep" and "stand alone" do not offer any solutions to the problem at all. "Thank god" is not relevant to the question.
The sentence suggests that something will happen to organic material as a result of dying, which implies a process of decomposition. The phrase "death and decay" is often used to describe the natural process by which a deceased organism breaks down and returns to the earth. The other options do not accurately describe the process of dying and its effects on organic material.
The sentence implies that there is something that all people have in common when it comes to their relationships with others. Since the other options do not relate to relationships or social interactions, we can eliminate them. Unique personalities and different standards are individual traits that are likely to vary from person to person. While values may also be shared by many individuals, they are not necessarily related specifically to interpersonal relationships. Lastly, food is not a trait that everyone possesses in relation to others. Therefore, the correct answer is that feelings, such as emotions and empathy, are something that everyone has in common when it comes to interacting with others.
When first meeting a child, it is common to ask their name to begin the conversation and establish a connection. The other options, such as asking questions or counting to ten, may come later in the conversation or interaction but would not be the first thing you ask a child. Costume and dress herself do not make sense in this context as they are not related to initial introductions.
The items listed - clock, clothing, and wrenches - are commonly found in a department store, which typically carries a wide variety of products for sale. The other options do not make as much sense, as a counter or desk may only offer a limited selection of items, a train station typically only sells transportation-related items or snacks, and a school room is not typically a place where items are sold.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to see new things in a new place, which can be achieved by looking around and exploring the area. This option is the most straightforward and logical choice. Taking pictures and experiencing new things are both possible outcomes of exploring a new place, but they are not the main action being described in the sentence. "Interesting" and "change of surroundings" are both vague and do not provide a clear action that can be taken to see new things in a new place.
Ice is known to melt when exposed to the sun's heat. When ice melts, it turns into water due to the increase in temperature. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Ice might be sculptured or carved, but not necessarily as a result of being in the sun. Ice cream is made from milk, sugar, and cream, and has nothing to do with the sun. Finally, Antarctica is a continent covered in ice, but the answer should be related to what happens to ice when exposed to the sun.
The other options (drawer, shelf, pantry) may be used for storing dishes as well, but a cabinet specifically designed for storing dishes is a more appropriate answer. Cabinets are commonly found in kitchens and dining areas and are often equipped with shelves, compartments, and slots for organizing dishes of various shapes and sizes. The option "apartment" is not applicable because it refers to a type of dwelling, not a storage location.
The sentence mentions the man laying on a soft surface, which suggests that he is on the ground. Additionally, the man looks up at the trees, which suggests that he is not in a tree or on top of a waterfall. Niagara Falls is not mentioned in the sentence, and while the man is in a forest, the question specifically asks for his location within the forest, which is on the ground.
The description of a person sitting quietly and their eyes moving suggests that they are in a state of deep concentration or mindfulness. This is a common practice in meditation, where the person may sit quietly and focus their attention on their breath, mantra, or other object of contemplation while their eyes move naturally. The other options do not fit with the description of someone in a meditative state, such as reading or falling asleep.
The question is asking where a stapler can be found in many places, implying that the answer should refer to a location that is easily accessible in multiple settings. The desk drawer and desktop are specific to individual workstations, while the office building and manual are too broad and do not necessarily guarantee the presence of staplers. The office supply store, on the other hand, is a likely location where customers can expect to find a variety of office supplies, including staplers.
The sentence mentions that the man is at a museum outside Barcelona. Martorell is a town located outside of Barcelona that has several museums, including the Museu de Martorell and the Museu de la Lliça. The other options such as cinema, falling down, show, or airplane do not relate to being at a museum outside of Barcelona.
The phrase "being played with" suggests that the toy soldier is currently in use, and the most likely place for it to be is in a child's hand. The other options are less likely, as a toy box may contain unused toys, movies do not involve physical toys, and toybos and child park are not commonly associated with the act of playing with a toy soldier.
A plane ticket is generally used to board an airplane for travel. The options pocket, terrorist's hands, sea ship, and briefcase are unlikely places to use a plane ticket. The airport is the most reasonable answer as it is where travelers go to check in and board their flights.
The sentence suggests that the subject is discussing the placement and arrangement of flowers, which usually involves using a vase as a vessel to hold the flowers. The other options, such as market or anthology, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Moreover, "table" and "countryside" could be associated with arranging flowers but, unlike "vase", they are not objects used for this purpose.
The question implies that the person wants to cross a river without getting their hair messed up, indicating that they care about their appearance. Using a bridge would be the most practical way to cross a river while maintaining a hairstyle, as it allows a person to walk across without getting wet or tangled up in vegetation. The other options (Wisconsin, waterfall, hatred, valley) are not relevant to the question and do not provide any clues to the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Batman had to settle for something, indicating that he was looking for a specific type of container to hold his beer. The options "shelf," "soccer game," and "refrigerator" are not containers and are therefore unlikely choices. A keg is a large container typically used for serving beer at a party, which may not be practical for one person to consume alone. A can is a small, single-serving container commonly used for holding beer, making it the most likely choice for Batman in this scenario.
The sentence specifically mentions a West African region on the Gulf of Guinea, which indicates that the answer is likely related to geography. The phrase "you can find a monkey" suggests that the question is about the distribution or habitat of a particular species. West Africa is home to many primates, including monkeys, and the rain forest is a common habitat for these animals. The other options are either not related to West Africa or do not have any connection to monkeys or their habitat.
The word "angry" suggests a negative emotional state that often leads to aggression, and surprising someone in this state can potentially exacerbate this aggression. It is possible that the other options, such as humor or laughter, may diffuse the anger, but it is unlikely that they would be the most common or expected outcomes in this context. "Fight" is the most reasonable choice given the potentially volatile nature of an angry person.
Cruise ships are notorious for their limited space, particularly in passenger cabins where dining areas may also be located. As a result, dining areas on cruise ships are often small in size. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
illing people is a serious crime and a morally reprehensible act. It is unlikely for someone to feel joy in such a situation, as it goes against most social and cultural norms. In fact, killing people often creates a sense of guilt and fear of punishment (like going to prison) in the person who committed the act. Seeking vengeance could be a possible motive for killing someone, but it is not an emotion that one experiences in the aftermath of the act. "Afraid" and "terrible" may describe the emotions of the victim or those who witness the act, but not of the person who committed it.
The sentence suggests that James has collided with someone playing football multiple times, and he is worried about the consequences. Given the physical nature of football, the most likely consequence is some kind of injury, and the fact that the sentence specifically mentions "not for the first time" suggests that this is an ongoing issue. Head injuries are a particularly serious concern in contact sports like football, as they can lead to long-term health problems. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence suggests that the speaker believes people should prioritize enjoying their lives and having fun, rather than being overly cautious or guarded. The phrase "we don't got long" implies a sense of urgency or the idea that life is short, which reinforces the importance of enjoying life. The other answer choices are either too specific (such as "get laid") or don't quite capture the sentiment of the sentence.
The question pertains to acquiring a pet lizard, which would typically be sold in a pet shop. The other choices, such as dessert or desert country, are not locations where pet lizards are commonly found or sold. Tropical areas may be a viable option, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer. The zoo is also not relevant, as it is a place to see animals but not to purchase them as pets.
A musical instrument would refer to an object that produces sound or music when played. The guitar is a common example of a musical instrument. The other options, such as music room or case, do not refer to the object that produces sound but rather the location where music is played or stored. Orchestra refers to a group of musicians playing together, and movie does not give any indication about the object being talked about.
The sentence implies that the affair was not known to the husband before its discovery, and the consequences of discovering it resulted in the end of something. Since the wife was in a committed relationship with her husband, the most likely option would be the end of their marriage. The other choices may also be affected by discovering an affair, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The question is asking for the most famous constellation out of earth, which implies that it is visible from Earth. The Milky Way is not a constellation, but a galaxy that Earth is a part of. "God's creation" is too vague and doesn't refer to any specific astronomical object. "Universe" is too broad and refers to everything that exists, not just constellations. "One moon" is not a constellation either, but a natural satellite of Earth. "Stars" is the best answer because constellations are made up of stars and some of the most famous constellations include Orion, Ursa Major, and Cassiopeia.
The sentence indicates that hotel guests will be walking by during the reception, implying that the venue is located in a common area of the hotel. The most likely location for this would be the lobby, as it is a central gathering spot for hotel guests. Room service and church basements are unlikely venues for a hotel reception, while a large room and country club may be possible options but are not as strongly suggested by the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the location being referred to is one where it is acceptable or common to consume beer. Among the options, only a friend's house suggests a social gathering where alcohol may be served. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "dismissed" suggests that the court case was ended prematurely, which may imply that the judge or jury was not invested in the case. The other options do not logically fit with the context of the sentence. "Change of heart" implies a reversal of opinion, which is not relevant in this context. "Anguish" and "anxiety" suggest emotional distress, which is not necessarily related to the outcome of a court case. "Anger" could potentially be a cause of a court case being dismissed, but it is not as likely as "boredom" in this scenario.
The question implies that there is a specific consequence that may occur if someone sits down quickly after consuming beans. This consequence is likely related to the digestion of the beans, which can produce gas and lead to flatulence. The other options are unrelated to beans or digestion, and do not provide a logical explanation for the suggested consequence.
The sentence implies that John was approachable and easy to communicate with. It can be inferred from the sentence that John was not a distant person because the speaker found it easy to talk to him. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that there is a location where people typically want to have a lot of coffee. The most likely option is the kitchen, as this is where many people prepare and consume their coffee in the morning. The other options (table, office, desk, and ocean) do not have a clear connection to coffee consumption.
The sentence suggests that the person is surrounded by food, which is a source of nutrition. "Stay alive" and "wanted to survive" may also be true, but they are not the best answer because they do not directly relate to the context of the sentence. "Grew" and "full" do not make sense because the sentence is referring to the act of eating or having access to food, not the physical attributes of the person.
The sentence suggests that James and his friend did not want to do much on their planned slow day, which indicates a desire for relaxation. The other choices, such as panic, alarm, joy, and cheer, do not align with the context of wanting a slow day and not wanting to do much.
The sentence suggests that the person needs a small car, which implies that compact would be the correct answer. Sturdy and faithful are characteristics that are more commonly associated with reliability and durability, and bound and packaged have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Dan is a farmer and has a heifer which he keeps for milk. The sentence also implies that Dan lives in a place which is cold and where finding good farmland may be difficult. Among the given options, Michigan is known for its cold climate and is also a state with a significant farming industry, making it a likely candidate. The other options do not match the context given in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Alice is intentionally delaying going to bed on Friday night because she plans on doing something specific on Saturday. "Sleeping in" is a common phrase that refers to staying in bed longer than usual in the morning, and it makes sense in the context of someone wanting to enjoy their weekend by getting more rest. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or would be unlikely for Alice to do based on the information provided.
The sentence suggests that the characters in the story are lost and unable to navigate without the use of a map. The glove compartment is a common place to store maps, so it makes sense that the character would retrieve a map from there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A personal key is typically used to unlock a front door of a home or apartment. The other options, such as a car stand or bus depot, are not commonly associated with personal keys as they usually require a different type of access or security measure. Similarly, while a key may be used at a hotel, it would not typically be referred to as a "personal" key, as it is not solely for the use of one person.
The sentence suggests that the cat was bothering its owner, which is a common behavior when cats are hungry. Additionally, the phrase "that time of day" implies that the cat is used to being fed at a certain time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence implies that the person in question is a singer and that their voice is suited to the alto section. This suggests that they joined a music group that includes parts for different types of voices, such as a choir. The other options do not typically involve vocalists or sections based on vocal range.
The question is asking where it is likely to find a Japanese restaurant NOT run by people from Japan. This implies that finding a Japanese restaurant run by non-Japanese people is uncommon. Options like California, Downtown, and China Town may have a higher population of Japanese people and therefore a higher likelihood of finding a restaurant run by Japanese people. Tokyo is part of Japan, so it doesn't fit the question. A large town would have a more diverse population and may have non-Japanese people running Japanese restaurants.
The defining characteristic of mammals is their ability to produce milk to nourish their young, which is why they are often associated with live birth and nursing. The fact that the animals in the sentence are described as having hair and not laying eggs is a strong hint that they are indeed mammals, as these are both common traits among this group. The other options (reproduce asexually, males, attack, ocean) are not related to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated.
Fox hunting is a popular sport in England and is associated with the aristocratic class. Therefore, it is likely that John, who is described as an aristocratic fox hunter, would live in England. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence doesn't provide enough information to determine the correct answer. It only mentions a grape being fed to someone else, but doesn't provide any context or location. Therefore, it's unlikely that any of the choices are the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the food should be kept somewhere specific after it is opened. The options "shop" and "bookcase" do not make sense in this context. "Shelf" could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough. "Kitchen" is too broad, as there are many places in a kitchen where food could be stored. "Refrigerators" is the correct answer, as it is a common practice to refrigerate food after it has been opened to prevent spoilage.
The sentence suggests that Sam had a frightening dream that caused him to remain awake, and the option that best fits this description is "nightmare." A nightmare is a type of dream that causes feelings of fear, terror, or distress and can sometimes awaken the dreamer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Going to a party in a new town implies that you don't know anyone there and therefore you're looking forward to socializing and meeting new people. Making new friends is a common goal when attending parties and social events. The other choices listed here are generally not healthy or desirable goals for attending a party, and do not align with typical social expectations.
The act of pedalling is what propels a bike forward, so this is the most logical answer. Practice and a sense of balance may help with riding a bike, but they do not directly cause it to move. Driving could refer to operating a motor vehicle, which is not relevant to this question. "Good balance" is similar to the "sense of balance" option and does not explain how a bike moves.
Literature refers to books and magazines, which are commonly stored on a shelf. The other options, such as own home, kitchen, and meeting, do not make sense in the context of where literature would typically be kept or stored.
An organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by blowing air through pipes or reeds. One type of organ is a pipe organ, which is composed of many pipes divided into different sections. Therefore, an organ is the only option in the list that is related to the concept of pipe divisions. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
The use of the word "congregation" suggests that people are gathering in the church, not leaving. The verb "funnel" can describe the act of congregating or gathering in a specific direction or location, such as into a church. The other options do not make sense in the context of a church gathering. The phrase "wind instrument" is unrelated, as is "blunderbuss," which is a type of gun. The phrase "associated with telephones" is also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that James needed smooth sandpaper, but he received a different type. The most likely alternative is rough sandpaper, which is the opposite of smooth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that borrowing furniture is the solution to not having any. The most likely place to borrow furniture would be from someone nearby who is willing to lend it to you, such as a neighbor's house. The other options do not have any logical connection to borrowing furniture.
The question is asking about what must happen for an animal and its offspring to continue living, which suggests that the animal needs to ensure its continuation through reproduction. Reproduction is the biological imperative for animals to pass on their genes and ensure the survival of their species. Death and eventually dying are not necessary for an animal and its offspring to continue living, while flying and food consumed do not address the question of continuation through future generations.
Wine is usually best stored in a cool, dark place with a stable temperature and humidity level. A cellar is a common location for storing wine because it provides these optimal conditions. The other options, movies, bed, moon, and vault, do not provide an appropriate environment for storing wine.
The question is asking about the initial step in opening a steakhouse. The answer is likely related to the physical establishment or location of the steakhouse, so options Michigan and Florida are less likely to be the correct answer. Wine is unrelated to the initial step of opening a steakhouse, so it can be eliminated as well. Texas could potentially be the correct answer if the context or location of the question included Texas, but without that information, building is the most logical answer as it pertains directly to the physical establishment.
The sentence implies that Sarah wanted to engage in an activity that was not physically demanding like playing but also not completely passive like doing nothing. Taking up a musical activity would provide mental stimulation and entertainment without requiring a lot of physical exertion. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either suggest excessive effort (serious, longplay) or complete inactivity (eat cake, doing nothing).
The sentence suggests that Joe was doing something outside and found spiders. Given the context, it is most likely that Joe was checking something that is commonly found in a garage, such as tools, equipment, or a vehicle. The other options, such as a cupboard, closet, or mailbox, are less likely to house spiders and are more associated with indoor spaces.
The question is asking for the appropriate action to take if your date does not show up. Among the options provided, waiting for the date to arrive is the most reasonable course of action, as it allows a chance for the person to arrive and explain their tardiness. Bathing or getting a haircut would not be relevant in this scenario. Planning revenge would be an extreme and inappropriate response, and dressing nice (though important for a date) would not serve any purpose if the date does not show up.
The context of the sentence implies that the adult is preparing for a job interview, which typically requires dressing in appropriate professional attire. The option "dress herself" would be incorrect as the sentence specifies that the subject is an adult male. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that even when items are on sale in retail stores, they are still considered expensive. This implies that the regular price of the items is considered high. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "farms" implies that John is growing or raising something, and "anemone" is a type of flower. A nursery is a facility where plants, including flowers, are cultivated for sale or transplantation. The other options (Michigan, swimming pool, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico) are not suitable places to grow flowers in a facility.
The verb "open" in the context of curtains suggests that the sun was being let into the room. The phrase "shine brightly" is a common way of describing the intensity of sunlight, and would make the most sense in this context. The other options either don't make sense or are unlikely given the context.
Releasing built-up energy is often associated with sexual pleasure and orgasm. The words "damage" and "exhaustion" suggest negative feelings, while "wonderful" and "lazy" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question specifies that the person is blind and paralyzed, which means they cannot physically analyze or examine things or go somewhere to see a favorite show. However, they still have their sense of hearing, which allows them to keep up with current events and hear news. Therefore, the correct answer is "hear news."
The word "hard" suggests that there is some difficulty or obstacle in bringing furniture to this location, and the word "stairs" is a commonly known obstacle in moving furniture. Apartments and lofts are common living spaces that may have stairs, but the option "rug" and "store" do not have any clear connection to the context of difficulty in bringing furniture.
The sentence implies that a great teacher can have a positive impact on a student's experience in school. The word "inspiration" suggests that a great teacher can motivate and encourage students to achieve their goals and perform well academically. The other options, such as "detention," "graduate," "follower," and "boredom," do not fit the context of the sentence or convey a positive meaning.
The sentence suggests that the sentence is asking about where to get wearable items to take home, which is a common function of a clothing store. A shopping mall may also have clothing stores, but it is not specific enough to answer the question accurately. A museum would not typically sell wearable items. A laundromat is a place where clothes are washed, not bought. A bedroom is an inappropriate choice as it is a place for sleeping and not shopping.
Clouds are formed by water vapor that condenses in the atmosphere. They float because they are less dense than the surrounding air. This is why they can be seen at different altitudes depending on the conditions in the atmosphere. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as clouds are a feature of the atmosphere and not found on the ground or in outer space.
The Empire State Building is well-known for being a landmark in New York City, specifically in the borough of Manhattan. The other options do not accurately describe the location of the building, as "office" and "the city" are too general, "Fifth Avenue" is only one street in Manhattan, and "New York City" is the name of the city as a whole, not a specific area within it.
Making coffee is typically done in a kitchen, which has the necessary equipment like a coffee maker, filters, and mugs. While coffee shops and offices may also have coffee makers, these locations are not typically associated with the act of "making" coffee, which suggests a more personal setting like a kitchen. Washing and table also do not make sense as coffee-making locations.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to what happens to their body after they have passed away. The options "bodycam," "home," and "coffin" do not make sense in this context. A coffin is a container used for burial, but it is not a service. A graveyard is a place where people are buried, but it is not a service either. A funeral, however, is a ceremony or service that is held to honor and remember the life of the deceased, and it typically involves the preparation of the body for burial or cremation. Therefore, the correct answer is funeral.
The sentence suggests that people were leaving country estates, which are typically located outside of cities, for row houses. Row houses are a type of housing commonly found in cities, suggesting that the people needed to move to a city in order to live in row houses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A hardware store is a common place to purchase hand and power tools, including saws. A toolbox and tool kit may already have a saw, but if it needs to be replaced or upgraded, a hardware store is a likely location to purchase a new one. A logging camp may have saws, but it is unlikely to be a retail location for purchasing them. An auger is a different type of tool used for drilling, and not relevant to the question.
The sentence suggests that before asking a question about a crime scene, there is something that needs to be done. It is important to think before asking a question to avoid contaminating the scene or causing harm to the investigation. Touching everything or giving clues could potentially disturb evidence or interfere with the investigation, so these options are unlikely. Expressing information and analyzing may be part of the investigation process but thinking is the crucial first step.
Fraternity houses are known for being social hubs in college campuses, where fraternity brothers often spend late nights together. The sentence suggests that the man did not excel academically in college, but that he had fond memories of spending time with his fraternity brothers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Horror movies often rely on characters being frightened or panicked, causing them to make poor decisions, such as tripping or falling when they try to run away from the killer. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or are redundant with "run."
The use of the word "change" suggests that the team was experiencing a problem or difficulty. The word "stagnation" means lack of activity or movement, which is often used to describe a team that is not performing well or making progress. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a place to buy clothes, which suggests that the correct answer should be a store that specializes in clothing. The options "grocery store" and "supermarket" are unlikely to sell clothing, so they can be eliminated. The word "mall" is a general term for a large shopping center that may contain clothing stores, but it is not a specific store that sells clothing. "Shop" is the most likely answer because it is a general term for a store that sells a specific type of goods, and many shops specialize in clothing.
A cupboard is typically used for storing dry foods, such as cereals, snacks, and pasta. The sentence implies that the location being referred to is intended for keeping food in a dry state, which makes a cupboard the most likely option. The other options, such as the oven or fridge, are commonly used for preparing or storing food but do not necessarily keep it dry. Etna and stomach are also not relevant to the question.
The sentence implies a situation where a person with mental illness is leading a normal life, which suggests that their condition is being "managed" or controlled to some extent with treatment or medication. The term "effectively treated" is also a possibility, but "managed" seems like a more accurate description of the situation presented. The other options, such as "recur," "cause delusion," and "illusion," have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the musical instrument needs to be protected from scratches, which is commonly achieved by keeping it in a case. A case provides a layer of padding and protection that can prevent scratches and other types of damage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A bank is not relevant to keeping a musical instrument safe, while an orchestra and music room are places where instruments are played and stored, but do not address the issue of protection. A movie is also not relevant to the topic.
The sentence suggests that the woman is watching TV to unwind and forget about her day. The context implies that she may be stressed or overwhelmed, and is using television as a form of escapism. The option "entertainment" could be a possible answer, but it is too broad and does not capture the specific intention of the woman's actions. The options "falling asleep", "getting fat", and "crying" do not make sense in relation to the context.
The sentence implies that seeing a gazelle is not a common occurrence and requires being in a specific environment. A gazelle is a type of antelope that is typically found in open plains and savannas in Africa, which makes "open plain" the most likely choice. The other options do not have any connection to the natural habitat of a gazelle.
The sentence suggests an action that involves a fast pace, which is commonly associated with running. Stretches involve slow, deliberate movements, and learning to walk is a process that takes time and involves a slower pace. Running from the police is a specific and illegal action, and getting out of bed may involve a quick movement but does not necessarily involve a fast pace.
The sentence implies that keeping pet birds free can be dangerous, so the best option is to keep them confined in some way to ensure their safety. The word "caged" is the most appropriate choice here, as it suggests that the birds are being kept in a secure enclosure rather than being allowed to roam free. The other options have negative connotations and would not be appropriate in this context.
Beavers are known for their ability to build intricate dams and lodges using wood and other materials found in their environment. Therefore, it is likely that their supplies come from a wooded area nearby. British Columbia is a geographic location and not relevant to the question. Body of water is a general term and not specific to the context of the question. Paying debts and zoos have no connection to beaver behavior.
The sentence suggests that Zane struggles with answering questions, and the word "suffers" implies that it causes him distress or difficulty. Panic is a common response to situations that cause anxiety, stress, or fear, so this choice is the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they neither describe a negative response to answering questions nor explain why Zane might struggle with it.
The question suggests that a celebrity might benefit from "going public" about a problem they are facing. This phrase typically refers to speaking openly to the media or sharing their story on social media. In this case, the question implies that the benefit of doing so is something that the celebrity gains, rather than the public or society as a whole. Among the given answer choices, "press coverage" is the option that directly relates to this idea. The other choices either do not make sense in the context or are unlikely to be seen as a benefit for a celebrity.
The context of the sentence suggests that the situation occurred in a public gathering space, likely a theater or opera house. The use of the word "seats" indicates that they were in a venue that had assigned seating, rather than a private home or outdoor location like the Grand Canyon. The options "basement" and "bedroom" also do not fit the context of the sentence, leaving "opera" and "concert" as the most likely options. However, the sentence specifically mentions an opera, so that would be the correct choice.
Strip malls are often known for having multiple businesses within one complex, including beauty salons. They provide convenience to customers as they can access several services in one place. The other options do not have as strong a connection to the context of the question.
Christmas typically follows Halloween on the calendar, with Halloween occurring on October 31st and Christmas falling on December 25th. The other options are not related to the holiday season or the order of holidays on the calendar.
The sentence implies that the speaker is referring to the relationship between family members. In a family tree, the different branches of a family tree are indicated by different limbs. Adding a "niece limb" would indicate the new addition to the family, who would be the daughter of the person's brother. The other options are not related to the concept of mapping out relationships between family members.
The bank teller was trying to convince the criminal that committing the crime was not the right thing to do, suggesting that it was something that he should not do. The other options (willing, optional, have to, and unnecessary) do not fit in the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information provided.
The sentence is asking for an item that is used to write with ink. Squids are not typically used to write with, newspaper and printer are not items used to directly write with, and a pencil case is used to store writing instruments such as pencils and pens, but not to write with directly. Fountain pens, on the other hand, are writing instruments that use ink cartridges or are refillable with ink to allow for smooth and consistent writing.
The sentence suggests that when the person walked into the room, they experienced a shock. This shock was likely caused by something unexpected happening. The word "surprised" fits this context because it means to be caught off guard by something unexpected, which is consistent with the sentence. The other options, such as "wanted" or "calm", do not make sense in this context because they do not fit the feeling of surprise that is being described. "Thundershock" is not a commonly used word and does not fit the typical way that surprise is described.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is not comfortable with physical touch, specifically hugging. The other options don't make sense in the context of meeting a friend, except for conversation which is a possibility but not mentioned in the sentence as a specific action done by the person. A handshake is a common way to greet someone without physical touch beyond a handclasp, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that if you were lost and needed a map while on the road, the best place to find one would be at a specific location. The options given are all different types of locations, but the context of the sentence suggests that it would be a place where travelers might stop for a break or to refuel. Gas stations are commonly found along highways and have maps available for purchase or sometimes for free. The other options may have maps available as well, but they are not typically associated with travelers stopping for directions or assistance.
The sentence suggests that Sage enjoyed interacting with his peers and specifically enjoyed communicating with them. The phrase "exchanging ideas" is a common way to describe a conversation or discussion between people where they share their thoughts and opinions. The other options, such as confusion, peer pressure, response, and learning, do not necessarily suggest that Sage enjoyed communicating with his peers in this way.
The sentence implies that the cat is snuggling with their owner, which more commonly happens on a bed rather than the other options such as the floor or a humane society. A comfortable chair or window sill may also be a place where a cat likes to perch, but it doesn't necessarily suggest snuggling with a human, whereas a bed is a common place where people and their pets sleep together.
The context of the sentence suggests that the place being described has large cables hanging overhead, which is a characteristic commonly associated with electrical substations. Substations are vital to the distribution of electricity across a city or region, and typically have large power lines and cables hanging overhead. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to a place where cars can safely travel at very high speeds. While cars can travel quickly on many different types of roads and tracks, a freeway is a type of highway designed specifically for high speed travel with limited access points and no interruptions from other vehicles or pedestrians. The other options either have slow speed limits, obstructions, or are not designed for high speed travel.
The sentence suggests that a person is watching something, indicating that this question is likely a hypothetical scenario. The context of the sentence implies that the man with the suitcase full of money is a character in a movie, rather than a real-life situation. The other options (subway, airplane, baggage compartment, cargo hold) are real-life scenarios in which a person might encounter a man with a suitcase, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "movie."
The contrasting images of enjoying a luxurious breakfast in bed while seeing a homeless person shivering outside implies a sense of guilt or discomfort. The other options, such as mess, spills, or indigestion, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is using a key to access a door, which is commonly associated with entering one's own house. The other options do not necessarily involve using a key or opening a hinged door, and therefore are less likely to be correct answers based on the given information.
The sentence suggests that the location referenced is a place where people are greeted or checked in upon entering. This is commonly found in a lobby, which is typically the area immediately inside the entrance of a building, such as a hotel or office. The other options do not have the same connotation of being a location where people are received upon entering.
The sentence implies that reading a newspaper from another country is a way to gain knowledge about the world. Newspapers typically report on current events and news from both local and international perspectives, which can help readers gain a broader understanding of global issues. The other options do not relate to gaining knowledge or reading a newspaper.
The sentence suggests that someone has accomplished something and that they want to recognize that accomplishment by putting the person's name somewhere. A roster is a list of names of individuals who are part of a certain group or organization, so in this context, it makes sense to put the person's name on a roster to recognize their achievement. The other options, such as a certificate or phone book, do not necessarily have a direct connection to recognition or accomplishment.
The sentence suggests that the person being described has a habit of delaying tasks until the last minute, which is a behavior commonly known as procrastination. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking for a verb that describes the action of not wanting to settle in one place. "Walk" and "remove" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Agitate" and "disturb" imply a sense of turmoil or unrest, which is not what the sentence is asking for. "Wander" is the best fit as it implies a leisurely and aimless movement, which aligns with the idea of not wanting to stay in one place.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for an area with good schools that is not in the city or metro area. The suburbs are often known for having good schools while still being outside of the city. The other options, such as woods, bed, rural, and neighborhood, do not necessarily have a strong correlation with good schools.
The sentence indicates that Jane is a senator who works for the government, and the question is asking where she spends a lot of time. The capitol building is the main headquarters for the U.S. Congress and is where senators and representatives spend a significant amount of their time working. Washington D.C. is also a plausible answer since it is the location of the capitol building, but the other options are not relevant to the sentence's context.
The word "procreate" means to have children, so it is the correct answer to the question. "Take oath" refers to making a solemn promise, "matrimony" refers to marriage, "please parents" is not directly related to the question, and "live life" is too broad and does not specifically refer to having children in a romantic relationship.
The sentence suggests that the policemen heard a cry from a distance and their subsequent action was in response to that sound. Running away or hurrying along would not be appropriate responses to a cry for help. Fine motorists and direct traffic are options that do not match the context of the sentence, as they have nothing to do with responding to a cry from a distance. Therefore, the correct answer must be help.
The sentence suggests that completing a job requires ambition, but it also implies that there is a specific first step that needs to be taken before the job can be completed. The phrase "begin work" is the most logical answer because it's the only choice that directly relates to starting a job. "Take care of proposals" suggests a more administrative role, "in charge of project" suggests a leadership role, "eat cake" is unrelated and "go to school" is likely irrelevant in this context.
Foxes are known for being a predator of chickens and other poultry, so it would not be desirable to have a fox in a hen house. The other options do not have a clear connection to the negative implications of having a fox present.
The question asks about the type of building that has the most top floor, which suggests that the answer has to do with a building's height. The option "tall building" directly relates to the concept of height, while the other options do not. "Go down" is a phrase that does not make sense in the context of the question. "Apartment building" and "office building" do not necessarily imply height - they can come in a range of sizes. "Cabin" usually implies a smaller, more rustic type of lodging, which again does not connect to the concept of height.
The question is asking about what happens to humans after they have died, so celebration and life are unlikely options. Rebirth may be a belief held by some religions, but it is not a common or universal practice. Decomposition technically occurs after death, but it is not something that humans do intentionally to other humans. Burial, on the other hand, is a common and traditional practice in many cultures, and involves placing the body in a grave or tomb.
The question is asking where a restaurant's phone number can be found, and the most likely option is at the hotel where the restaurant is located. Many hotels have a directory or information booklet that includes details about the various amenities and services available, including restaurants on the hotel property. The yellow pages and business sector may have listings for restaurants, but they may not always include phone numbers. The option of "town" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information on where to find the phone number.
The question is asking for an object that requires coins to function, which is commonly associated with a water fountain. Water fountains often have a slot for coins or tokens to be inserted in order to activate the water flow or other features. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is patriotic and has a camera, which implies that they are interested in taking pictures. Additionally, they are specifically looking for a bald eagle. Given that bald eagles are a national symbol of the United States, it is likely that the person is hoping to capture an image of the bird as an expression of patriotism. Therefore, the correct answer is photograph. The other options (city, Canada, Minnesota, and thermal) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking to use a piano in their neighborhood, implying that they cannot have one at home. The options "neighbor's house" and "drawing room" would not be feasible as they do not provide access to a piano. "Lunch" is an unrelated word and cannot be the answer. A music school or music store would likely have a piano available for use or rent, making them the most relevant options.
Shower curtains are commonly found for purchase at department stores or dime stores (discount stores). Restaurants and hotels typically do not sell shower curtains, and bathtubs are not a location where one would obtain a shower curtain.
The word "romantic" in the sentence suggests that the activity of kissing is associated with a special emotional connection between two people. The word "partner" is commonly used to refer to someone in a romantic relationship, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context - "anus" is not typically associated with kissing, "arousal" is a physical state that may or may not be present during kissing, while "trust" and "cooperation" are important in any relationship, but not necessarily specific to romantic ones.
It is a common milestone for children to learn how to state their own name before entering school. This helps them to introduce themselves and participate in classroom activities. While learning to count and socialize are also important skills for young children, they are not typically considered prerequisites for attending school. Dressing oneself and keeping a clean room are household tasks that may be encouraged, but are not necessarily related to school preparation.
Eye contact is commonly advised during job interviews as it conveys confidence, credibility, and honesty. The other options are either irrelevant or counterproductive during a job interview. Small talk may be appropriate to build rapport, but it is not the main focus. Friendship and social life are personal topics that are not relevant to the job interview. Getting tired of the interviewer is certainly not an advisable approach.
This question is referencing the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where they were forbidden from eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The serpent convinced Eve to eat the fruit, and she then convinced Adam to eat it as well, leading to their expulsion from the garden and the introduction of sin and suffering into the world. The other options do not have any connection to this specific story.
The sentence suggests that the neighborhood had a tight-knit community, which is often associated with close proximity and shared living spaces. The option "apartment building" fits this description, as it is a type of housing where residents often share common areas and interact with each other. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "kind" suggests that the correct answer will involve a thoughtful or considerate action. Opening doors for others is a common example of this type of behavior, as it shows respect for the other person and acknowledges their needs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of kindness.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to what a person will do for a living. Making money is a common purpose of going to work. The other options, such as "cross street" or "falling down," do not make sense in the context of work. "Draw attention to themselves" could be a possible answer, but it is less likely because it is not always the main purpose of work. "Come home" is also not a correct answer because it describes the end of the workday, rather than what a person does during work.
The clue in the sentence is that John was glad to be on the east coast. The options given are all US states or regions, and only South Carolina is on the east coast. The other options are either inland or in the west, so they do not fit the context of the sentence.
Laboratories are typically used for scientific and medical purposes where cleanliness and hygiene are crucial. Mice present a risk of contamination and can affect the accuracy of experiments, making it an undesirable place to find them. The other options, such as loft and attic, are commonly known locations where mice may be found but do not have the same association with cleanliness and precision as a laboratory.
The sentence suggests that the man is trying to improve his physical condition through the activity of jogging. "Getting in shape" is a common expression used to describe the process of becoming more physically fit, which is likely the goal that the man had in mind when he started to learn how to jog. The other options all suggest negative outcomes or side effects of jogging, which would not be desired by someone who is trying to improve their health.
The sentence implies that people are seeking information on their phones, which suggests that they are likely using a form of technology to access that information. The options "book" and "manual" are unlikely, as people are not likely to consult physical books or manuals for information on their phones. "Google" is a search engine that can be used on the internet, so it is a potential answer. "Online" is a bit redundant, as the internet is an online platform, but it is still a potential answer. Therefore, "internet" is the most likely correct answer.
Decomposition is the process by which a body breaks down and returns to its basic elements after death. This is a natural process that occurs as a result of biological and chemical reactions in the body. The other options are not relevant to the topic of what happens to a body after death.
Clam chowder is a type of soup that typically includes potatoes as one of the main ingredients. Beef stew might include potatoes as well, but the word "soup" indicates that the correct answer is a liquid dish. "Own kitchen," "kitchen cabinet," and "pantry" are not types of soup and have no relevance to the question.
The sentence suggests that the coach saw something in the person that allowed them to believe that they could achieve success in spite of their disability. The word "encouraging" implies that the coach was optimistic and supportive, and the phrase "positive coach" suggests that the coach had a positive outlook on the person's abilities. The other options, such as "pity," do not fit the context of the sentence as they imply a negative view of the person's disability.
The context of the sentence suggests that the subject had a theory about what they could do in the big game and, therefore, likely repeated the activity or strategy repeatedly to improve their chances of success. The correct spelling is "practice" with a "c" when used as a noun, and "practise" with an "s" when used as a verb in some British English contexts. The other options, such as "park," "fact," and "practical," do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "rise" implies that the object is moving upwards, which means that it is getting higher. If you are below the object, you are looking up at it as it rises. The other options do not accurately describe the position of an observer in relation to an object that is rising.
The sentence suggests that the person is preparing for a long hike and needs to bring food with them. Putting the food can in a cabinet or house wouldn't make sense, and putting it in a recycling center is not relevant to the context of the sentence. The last option, "make person sick," is not a logical place to put a food can. Therefore, the only logical option that fits with preparing for a hike would be putting the food can in a backpack.
The context of the sentence suggests that the rug is being used as a doormat, which would be placed in the hall near the front door. The other options do not correspond to the function or location of a doormat. Persia is a region known for producing rugs, but it is not a location where one would keep a rug near a front door. A desk or table would not be appropriate locations for a doormat, and the living room is not typically where one would place a doormat.
The sentence suggests that slipping from a ladder propped on anything will result in a negative outcome. The only choice that directly relates to a negative outcome is "fall down." The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence, and do not provide any insight into what will happen if someone slips from a ladder.
The word "shop" is commonly associated with buying things, including food. The other choices are not relevant to getting food in the context of the question. The word "table" refers to a piece of furniture used for eating, while "Disneyland" is a theme park and has no connection to getting food. "Refrigerators" and "pantry" are places where food is stored, but they do not necessarily indicate a means of obtaining food.
The sentence suggests that Brad was unable to get out of bed, so instead he continued to do something that he was already doing, which is lying down. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence; if Brad was trying to get out of bed, he would not go down or sit down, and falling down implies a loss of balance or control that is not indicated in the sentence. Lying to himself may be possible, but it is not suggested in this particular sentence.
The word "heifer" refers to a young female cow that has not yet had a calf. In the context of the question, it suggests that the heifer in question is of high quality, meaning she has desirable traits, such as good genetics or a healthy body. Taking a heifer to a cattle show would be the logical option in this case, as these events are often used to showcase and compare the best animals in a given breed or category. The other options, such as taking her home or to a dairy farm, do not necessarily imply that the heifer is particularly high quality or show-worthy.
Opening a business is typically seen as a means to generate income and accumulate wealth. As such, "get rich" is the most likely answer. None of the other options reflect the intended purpose of opening a business, which is to generate revenue and potentially become financially successful. In fact, the options "bankruptcy" and "lose money" are actually the opposite of what one hopes to achieve by opening a successful business.
The word "undergraduate" refers to a student who is pursuing a bachelor's degree. When someone finishes their undergraduate studies, it means they have completed their bachelor's degree requirements and have earned a diploma. Therefore, the correct answer is "graduated." The other options refer to further degrees or career titles that typically require additional education beyond a bachelor's degree.
Bus stops are typically more common in urban areas, where there is a higher population density and a greater need for public transportation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Bill is looking for a responsible stranger with kids, which implies that he is possibly looking for a nanny or a babysitter. The train station is a logical choice since it is a transportation hub and people with children often take trains for long-distance travel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lemurs are primates that are commonly found in the rain forests of Madagascar, which is a geographical location that is similar to a market in terms of the amount of biodiversity and activity that may be present. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about something that could be placed under furniture. A common item to place under furniture is a rug, which can protect the floor and add some texture to the room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "performing" suggests that this question is about a performance or production of some kind. When a director says "action," it is a cue for the actors to begin performing their roles. The other options do not make sense in the context of a performance.
The sentence suggests that poor college students gain something by learning about the world. "Mobility" often refers to the ability to move around freely and easily, which might suggest that learning about the world could lead to greater opportunities to travel or explore different parts of the world. The other options either have no clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not likely to be positive outcomes. For example, "global warming" is a negative phenomenon that is unlikely to be presented as a benefit.
The sentence implies that carrying books all day is necessary, which is commonly associated with attending university or college. Students often have to bring multiple textbooks and materials to their classes and study sessions, so carrying books is a common activity at universities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Seaweed is a type of marine plant that grows in the ocean, typically along the coastlines of beaches and in shallow waters. While some types of seaweed can be found in other bodies of water, such as lakes or rivers, it is generally associated with the sea or ocean. Therefore, the correct answer is sea plant.
Cooked steaks should be stored in the freezer to prevent spoilage and maintain their quality. When storing cooked steak, it is important to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. The other options are not suitable for storing cooked steak properly. Storing cooked steak on a plate or in Tupperware may cause bacteria to grow and make the steak go bad quickly. The oven and grill are for cooking, not storing.
The sentence suggests that John wants to clean all the dust out of his place before watching TV, implying that the TV is not the hardest place to dust. The closet, attic, and most buildings are too general to be considered specific places to dust. However, the phrase "settling down" implies that John wants to be comfortable while watching his favorite shows, so it is likely that he will focus on cleaning the area close to his seating arrangement, which could include the space under the bed. Therefore, it is most likely that the hardest place John will have to dust is under the bed.
The sentence suggests that something broke into the garbage, which indicates an act of animal behavior rather than human behavior. The other options (eyes, fingertips, brainstem, and human body) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. It is also common for animals to scavenge through garbage for food, so it further supports the answer choice of "animal."
Pamphlets are generally considered to be printed materials that are sold or distributed for informational or educational purposes. Bookstores are places where books and other printed materials are sold, so it is likely that they would carry pamphlets as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the audience was cheering when a goal was scored, which is a common occurrence in sporting events such as soccer or hockey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a western state with a coastline that is several thousand miles long. California fits this description with its extensive Pacific Ocean shoreline that stretches over 840 miles. The other options, such as a picture of the seaside or a beach, do not provide information about a specific state with a lengthy coastline.
The sentence suggests that the tour guide is explaining why everyone is crying at the holy site. The word "common" implies that this is not an unusual occurrence and happens frequently. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Profane" means disrespectful, "halibut" is a type of fish, and "damaged" does not fit with the emotional tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person's smile was opposite to a "frown," which is commonly associated with sadness or unhappiness. Therefore, the correct answer is "frown" as it implies the opposite meaning. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
Public monuments are often placed in areas that are easily accessible and visible to the general public, such as parks or other public spaces. Municipal parks are owned and operated by the city, making them a likely location for a public monument to be erected. Offices, state parks, cemeteries, and public gardens are not typically associated with public monuments in the same way that municipal parks are.
The word "neighbor" typically refers to someone who lives near or next to you. Therefore, if a person wants no neighbors, they would choose to live in an area where there are no other houses or apartments nearby. The only option that fits this criterion is "woods," which suggests a location in a forest or wooded area, far away from other housing developments. The other options all involve living near other people or in built-up areas.
The question refers to a PWR, which stands for Pressurized Water Reactor, a type of nuclear power plant. The control room for a PWR is typically located within the nuclear power plant, as it is responsible for regulating and monitoring the reactor and its systems. The other options do not have any logical connection to the function of a PWR control room.
The sentence implies that someone puts up posters of a lost dog, indicating that the dog has gone missing. This suggests that the correct answer is "get lost." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as training, barking, and rolling over all seem unrelated to a lost dog, while requiring water is a basic need that dogs have regardless of their situation.
The question asks for the location of the most famous BBQ steakhouses in America. Texas and Kansas City are both well-known for their barbecue, with many famous BBQ steakhouses located in those areas. Maine and falling down do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, and building is too vague to be a possible answer.
The phrase "kept plugging away in his cubicle" suggests that the person was working diligently on their own. The contrast is drawn with the fact that everyone else was called into the conference, which suggests that the conference was an important meeting or event. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the individual is attending school and falling asleep, which implies that they are not engaged in the lesson and find it dull or uninteresting. Boredom is a common reason for students to feel sleepy during class. Malaria is a tropical disease caused by parasites, and it is unlikely for someone to have malaria while attending school. Graduate is a term used to describe successfully completing a degree program, which does not relate to the context of the sentence. Inspiration refers to a feeling of being inspired or motivated, which does not fit the context of the sentence. Detention is a form of punishment, which is not relevant to someone being sleepy during class.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a gong, which is a musical instrument. The options "orchestra," "church," and "Chinese temple" may have gongs, but it is unlikely that they would sell them. "Chinatown" may have stores that sell gongs, but it is not a reliable option. "Music store" is the best option because they specialize in selling musical instruments, and it is likely that they carry gongs.
The sentence suggests that friends in need of help would do something specific as a result. The option "call each other" is the most likely choice, as it implies communication and a willingness to reach out for assistance. The other choices may be associated with friendship, but they do not necessarily fit the context of friends helping each other.
The sentence implies that people are engaged in a game, and when people participate in games, their primary motivation is the desire to win. This is because games often involve competition and the desire to prove oneself or outperform others. The other options listed do not align with the context of the sentence or have any relation to the nature of playing games.
A battle that involves words typically refers to a legal battle, where lawyers argue their case in front of a judge or jury. This is commonly seen in a court room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that John has no problem with waiting in a line, but it is the game after that he dislikes due to time and sore feet. This suggests that John may not enjoy standing for long periods of time, which is necessary when waiting in a line. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a term that describes the act of moving from one place to another, and the term "transporting" is the most appropriate answer. The other options - fire, energy, car, and staying in place - do not convey the meaning of movement from one location to another.
The phrase "catnap" suggests that the old man is taking short naps during the day, most likely on a couch. The other options suggest going to bed, which would not be feasible for multiple naps during the day, or simply relaxing without the implication of sleeping. "Lie down" is the most appropriate option for the given context.
A blunderbuss is a type of primitive firearm that was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. It features a short barrel that flares out at the end, giving it a distinctive bell shape. The other options, such as barbell, funnel, wind instrument, and kettlebell, do not have any connection to firearms or the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a good place to store pamphlets, which are usually small, flat documents. A drawer would provide a secure and organized place to keep the pamphlets, without taking up too much space. The other options (library, health department, bookstore) are public spaces and may not be convenient for storing personal pamphlets. The mailbox is inappropriate for storing anything other than mail.
The sentence suggests that fishing is a relaxing activity, and that many people enjoy another relaxing activity while fishing. Getting tied up lure and looking for information are not commonly associated with fishing as a leisure activity. Getting wet is also not necessarily enjoyable for everyone and may not be a typical part of fishing. Drinking beer may be a common activity while fishing but is not necessarily relaxing for everyone. Sitting quietly is often associated with fishing as a way to enjoy nature and the peacefulness of being on a body of water.
The question is asking about where to obtain maps that you own, suggesting that you want to purchase or borrow them for personal use. The options "electrical circuit" and "cabinet" have no relevance to obtaining maps. The option "important when traveling" is a phrase rather than a location and does not offer a clear choice. Both bookstores and libraries are common places to find maps for personal use, so either of these options could be correct.
When it comes to food, the mouth is the most logical answer for where to put a hamburger. The other options are places where hamburgers can be found or prepared, but they do not answer the question of where to put a hamburger.
The question is asking for a place to store a steel pen in an office setting, which suggests a location indoors. The options "car shop," "car," and "warehouse" are all locations outside of an office and therefore unlikely options. The option "hand" doesn't make sense as a place to store a pen. A desk drawer is a common and convenient location for storing office supplies, including pens.
World War II took place from 1939-1945, which is in the past. Therefore, a story about this event would be set in the past, not the future or present. The other answer choices, such as book or library, book or magazine, and newspaper, are irrelevant to the question as they do not indicate a specific time period.
Marmots are typically found in mountainous areas, especially in rocky and alpine habitats. They are adapted to high altitudes and cooler temperatures, which is why they prefer mountainous environments. The other options, such as wood piles, jungle, petting zoos, and animals, do not provide a suitable habitat for marmots.
The sentence suggests that people make assumptions that are not based on logic or reason, but rather on their biases or preconceived notions. To achieve better outcomes, they should engage in critical thinking and analyze situations objectively before making any assumptions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - setting a table or playing games, for example, would not have any impact on a person's ability to make informed assumptions. Lying is also not a suitable option, as it would only exacerbate the problem. Reading books, on the other hand, could be helpful in expanding a person's knowledge and challenging their assumptions.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking for an activity that can be done while traveling in a car, which usually involves sitting down and being in a confined space. Walking and playing basketball require space and movement that is not possible in a car. Playing chess requires a board and pieces, which may not be practical to bring on a car trip. Watching television may not be available in every car and can also cause motion sickness for some people. However, listening to music can easily be done with headphones or through the car's sound system and does not require much physical movement.
The question is asking for a location where a trumpet and other instruments made from the same material would be heard. The material is specified as brass, which narrows down the options to brass instruments. A brass band is a type of musical ensemble that consists of brass instruments, including trumpets, as well as percussion. The other options do not specifically refer to brass instruments or ensembles.
The sentence indicates that the audience was listening to an orchestra play, which strongly suggests that they were attending a musical performance. Of the choices provided, only "concert hall" fits this description. "Museum" and "school" are unlikely venues for a musical performance, while "hockey game" and "sporting event" are completely unrelated to the context given.
The use of the phrase "stabbing to death" indicates that the death was violent and likely gruesome. The other options do not fit the context of a violent death. "Pool of blood" and "killing" are related to the act of violence, but do not describe the manner of dying itself. "Being arrested" and "charming" have no relevance to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is expecting to receive something from their boss at the end of the week. The term "getting" often implies receiving something in return, which rules out options like asking for or work. The option food is also unlikely since it is uncommon for employers to provide food as a form of compensation. Energy may be a plausible choice depending on the context, but the speaker's use of the term "you boss" implies a professional relationship, suggesting that money is the most probable answer.
Hot dogs are a popular food item sold at baseball stadiums along with other traditional ballpark fare like peanuts and cracker jacks. The other options do not have any connection to the context of having a ticket and eating hot dogs.
The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question. San Francisco is a location, not a place to buy fresh fruit. A refrigerator is a household appliance and not a place to purchase fruits. A big box retailer may sell fruits, but they may not necessarily be fresh. A tree is a natural source of fruit, but it does not specify where to find it. On the other hand, a market is a common place where fresh fruits are sold.
The sentence indicates that the man is taking paperwork to other people to consult with them, which suggests that he is heading to a place where he can meet with others to discuss the paperwork. A meeting is a common setting for collaboration and discussion in many workplaces, whereas the other options (desk, office, table, work) do not necessarily imply that other people will be involved in the consultation process.
The sentence suggests that whatever Stark was doing, it was harmless and enjoyable. Playing marbles is a common pastime that fits this description, whereas painting nails, constructing, and wild rides could potentially be more dangerous or require more effort. Needing rest is also not a likely activity to be described as "having fun." Therefore, playing marbles is the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the church is providing some kind of aid or support, which implies that they are hoping to help someone or some group of people. "Helping others" is the only option that directly relates to this context, as the other options do not reflect a clear purpose for the church's actions. "Exhilaration" and "happiness" are both positive emotions, but they do not necessarily indicate a specific goal or motivation for the church's assistance. "Hardship" and "risk taking" are both negative, and do not make sense in the context of an organization providing aid.
The question is asking about the afterlife and assumes the belief in a higher power, specifically asking about the location one would go after death. Heaven is a common concept in many religions and is often associated with the afterlife for those who have lived a virtuous life. The other options do not pertain to the specific concept of an afterlife or the belief in a higher power.
The sentence suggests that eating a hamburger can have negative consequences immediately after consumption. Indigestion is a common after-effect of eating heavy, high-fat meals like hamburgers. 'Tasty' might be a potential choice for a positive effect of eating a hamburger, but the sentence specifically asks for an immediate consequence, and 'tasty' does not fit this criterion. 'Health problems' and 'gain weight' are possible longer-term consequences of regularly consuming fast food like hamburgers, but they don't fit the immediate timeframe requested in the question. 'Eat cake' is not even a consequence, but an alternative suggestion that is not related to the question.
A cupboard is a piece of furniture that is often used to store items such as dishes, food, and other household items. It is common for cupboards to have doors that hide the contents inside, including any shelves that may be present. The other options, such as a refrigerator, bookstore, school building, or wardrobe, are unlikely to have a shelf hidden behind a door as they serve different purposes and do not typically have a layout that would accommodate such a feature.
The sentence suggests that the man was catching motor oil that was draining from something, and getting a pail to do so implies that this is something he has done before. Since motor oil is typically associated with cars, it is likely that the man was in his garage, where he would keep his car and car-related tools and supplies. The other options (hardware store, utility room, wishing well, laundry) do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about cold storage that could be found in a typical household, which rules out options like laboratory and warehouse. Ice packs are typically used for temporary cooling, and are not a long-term storage solution. That leaves freezer and refrigerator as the two most likely options. However, the word "kind" suggests that the question is asking for a more specific type of cold storage, and refrigerators are typically designed for storing food and beverages at a cool but not frozen temperature, while freezers are designed for long-term storage of frozen food. Therefore, the best answer is refrigerator.
The question is asking for a location where a high number of restaurants can be found, specifically between 1000 and 10000. It is unlikely that a small town or a town would have that many restaurants, and Canada is too large of an area to provide a specific location. Yellow pages is a directory and not a location. Big cities, on the other hand, are known for having a large number of restaurants due to their high population density and diverse cultures. Therefore, the correct answer is big city.
The sentence mentions a pitcher stepping on a mound, which indicates that the context is related to the sport of baseball. A pitcher typically stands on a raised area known as a "mound" in the middle of a baseball diamond or field. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A statue is often found on a platform in a building, such as a pedestal or base. It is less likely to be found in an arena or concert hall where the space is more open and there may not be a dedicated platform for a statue. Museums may have statues on display, but they may also be displayed on a pedestal or platform. Therefore, the most likely answer is "building."
The sentence suggests that a round brush has a use other than for hair. Art supplies is a logical option as round brushes are commonly used for painting and other artistic mediums. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence as they all relate to hair and grooming.
The sentence suggests that the teen is spending a lot of time in bed, which is typically associated with relaxing activities like listening to music. Additionally, the fact that the teen's parents think he is bored implies that he is not doing anything highly stimulating or active, making choices like lifting weights or playing chess less likely. The option to "meet interesting people" also doesn't make sense in this context as the teen is described as staying in bed, which is a private setting.
The sentence suggests that the person at the picnic was worried because they forgot their "chewables" which could prevent a negative health outcome. Given the context of the sentence and the choices available, the most likely negative health outcome is heartburn which can be caused by eating hamburger (a greasy meat) without taking antacids or other medications to prevent acid reflux. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Electrodes require a source of energy to function properly, which is typically provided by a battery. Without a functioning battery, the electrode will not be able to spark. The other options may be components involved in electrical circuits, but they are not directly related to the functioning of an electrode.
The term "government" refers to the governing body of a country, and their primary duty is to work for the benefit of that country and its citizens. Democracy is a type of government, not the entity that the government should work for. Canada is a country, not the entity that the government should work for. Civilization is a broad term that can encompass many different nations and societies, and tax office is a specific department within a government, not the entity that the government should work for.
Engineering is a field that heavily relies on mathematical concepts, calculations, and problem-solving. A student in engineering must have a solid foundation in mathematics to be able to design, analyze, and optimize various systems and structures. The other options are not specific to engineering, and although a student in engineering may need to answer questions, learn a language, begin studying, or be able to count, these are not specific requirements for success in the field.
Division and multiplication are closely related mathematical concepts, with division being the inverse operation of multiplication. If the teacher knows that her students understand division, it makes sense that she would want to move on to teaching them multiplication as the next logical step in their mathematical education. The other options, such as "putting together" and "unity," do not have any clear connection to division or multiplication.
The sentence suggests that the dictionary was available for kids to use when they needed to know a definition. The most logical place for a dictionary to be in a school setting would be in the classroom where students can easily access it when needed. The other options, such as pocket or shelf, are not typically associated with dictionaries being readily available in a school setting.
The sentence suggests that long bike rides can have negative consequences, and "fatigue" is a common side effect of physical exertion. "Enjoyment" is unlikely to be the answer since the sentence is talking about negative effects, while "falling down" and "getting lost" are unrelated to the physical strain of biking. "Thirst" is possible but less likely since it is a common experience during any physical activity, not just biking specifically.
The question asks for something that could happen to a cat other than wanting food, so it is important to eliminate the option "hungry" since it is related to food. The word "feline" refers to a cat, so it is not a plausible answer. "Sharp claws" is a characteristic of cats, but it does not relate to the question at hand. "Pussycat" is another word for cat, so it is not a viable option either. Therefore, the correct answer is "thirsty," as cats also require water to drink.
The question is asking what the room would be without any other noise besides the music being turned off. The word "silent" is the best fit as it means "free from sound or noise" and accurately describes a room where no other noise is present. "Opera," "television," and "elevator" are not related to the context of the question, and "silence" is a repetition of the word "silent" without adding any clarity or new information.
The question is asking about the country with the most fast food restaurants, so options like "new york," "blocks of flats," and "center of town" are not relevant as they do not refer to a country. "Big cities" could be a possibility, but it is too general and could refer to many countries. Therefore, the best answer is "America" since it is a country and is well-known for its fast food industry.
The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to use string to prevent something from moving, which implies that the string needs to be secured in place. "Tie around" is the only option that describes physically securing the string, as opposed to winding or weaving it. "Stringbed" and "ball up" are not common uses of string, and are not likely solutions to the problem described in the sentence.
The question suggests that the location being referred to is a place where people move through a central passage to reach an elevator. This is a common feature of public buildings, such as office buildings or shopping malls. The other options, such as a tomb, arena, access rooms, or house, do not typically have elevators that would require a central passage to access.
The sentence indicates that the potato is currently stored in a cellar. A cellar is typically a cool, dark, and dry space that can be used for food storage. The other options, such as a farmer's market, grocery bag, pantry, and fridge, are not likely places for a potato to be stored long-term. A bushel basket may be used for storing potatoes, but it is not as specific as the given context of a cellar.
Networking typically involves meeting and connecting with other professionals or individuals in a particular field or industry. The objective of networking is usually to establish relationships that can lead to new opportunities, partnerships or collaborations. Building trust is therefore an important aspect of networking, as it helps to establish credibility and creates a foundation for future interactions. The other options do not relate to the purpose or practices of networking.
The sentence suggests that spare linens are typically stored in the same place as socks, which indicates that it is a location commonly used for clothing storage. The options "hospital" and "cabinet" are not typically associated with personal clothing storage, and the option "home" is too broad and vague to be a useful answer. "Chest" could be a possible answer, but "dresser drawers" is a more specific and common location for storing clothing items like linens and socks.
The phrase "think too quickly" suggests that people may be making quick judgments or assumptions without fully considering all the facts, which is commonly referred to as "jumping to conclusions." The other answer choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
While there are various reasons why someone may engage in sexual activity, "human experience" seems like the most appropriate choice based on the context of the question. Sexploiter and chicken are not related to the topic of sex, while reproductive cycle and procreation are too specific and may not encompass all the reasons people have sex. "Human experience" is a broad term that can capture the emotional, physical, and psychological aspects associated with sexual activity.
The sentence suggests that the activity of creating art can be a mentally and physically exhausting process. Therefore, it makes sense that someone would want to relax once they've finished their work. "Frustration" does not fit the context because it suggests that the person had a difficult time creating the art. "Eat" and "communication" do not follow from the context provided. "Enlightenment" could be a possible answer if the context suggested that the art had some spiritual or philosophical significance.
The sentence is asking about how to get clean clothes, which implies that the clothes are currently dirty. The options "get dirty" and "writing" have no relevance to cleaning clothes. "Use water" is necessary for cleaning clothes, but not sufficient on its own. The options "launder" and "soap" are both methods commonly used for cleaning clothes, but "launder" specifically refers to the process of washing and cleaning clothes.
The sentence suggests that the person was trying to reduce their weight but made a mistake with a shrink ray. This means that the shrink ray did the opposite of what was intended, causing the person to become larger rather than smaller. Therefore, the correct answer is "grow." The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Christine is too old to be having a baby, which implies that she is an adult. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "begin to talk" and "girl" do not have any clear connection, while "old person" and "old man" imply a much older age than what is suggested by the sentence.
The word "percussion" is commonly associated with marching bands and orchestras, which frequently use drums and other percussion instruments as part of their musical arrangements. Music stores and own homes may have percussion instruments available, but the focus on playing in "something" suggests a larger, organized group such as a band or orchestra. Parties may also feature live music, but it is less likely that a percussion instrument would be the featured instrument at a party.
The context of playing ball suggests that the activity is being done for leisure or entertainment. While competition and winning may be motivations for some individuals, the word "mostly" implies that the primary goal is enjoyment. Losing and injury do not align with the idea of having fun, and are unlikely to be the intended answer.
When someone is competing against another person, it is important that both parties are on a level playing field. This concept of fairness is emphasized by the fact that cheating and sabotage are mentioned as incorrect choices. Practice and in competition are both related to the act of competing, but do not necessarily address the need for fairness in the competition.
Silk is a luxurious fabric, often used in expensive clothing and garments. It is valued for its smooth texture and lustrous sheen, making it a popular choice for formal wear such as dresses, suits, and blouses. Jean and parachutes are made from different materials, and mulberry trees are the source of silk production but not items that display it directly in a noticeable way. Expensive clothing is a broad category that can include different types of items, but garments specifically refer to pieces of clothing that cover the body.
The word "wealth" suggests a large amount or abundance, and "information" implies knowledge or resources. A library is a place where one can access a vast amount of information and resources in the form of books, journals, and other materials. The other options do not offer the same level of access to information as a library. A park is a recreational area; a meeting is a gathering of people; the internet is a vast network of data and communication, but it is not curated in the same way as a library; a book is a single source of information, not a large collection.
The sentence suggests that the speaker did not want their resume to be carelessly tossed into a drawer. The most logical place for a resume to go in an office setting would be on the office desk, where the receptionist could easily file it or pass it along to the appropriate person. The other options (file cabinet, nightstand, kitchen cabinet, the floor) do not make sense in the context of a job application.
Injecting water into oneself would likely dilute the blood, and potentially cause dangerous electrolyte imbalances. This is because the human body requires a certain balance of salts and minerals in the bloodstream, which would be disrupted if water were injected into the body. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence mentions that the athletes are playing baseball, a physically demanding sport that can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. The phrase "soak in hot tubs" suggests that the athletes are attempting to alleviate this discomfort, which is a common reason why people use hot tubs. The other options (fame, errors, strikes) do not seem related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the gambler is unhappy, which could be due to experiencing a negative outcome. One option stands out as a negative outcome, which is losing money. Playing cards, poker, and doubling winnings are activities that could result in either winning or losing, so they do not necessarily explain the gambler's unhappiness. Similarly, winning the prize would typically result in happiness, so this option is also unlikely to be correct.
The sentence suggests that there is a positive reason for eating vegetables, and the phrase "plain what you" implies that the reason is something that is widely recognized. Most people know that vegetables are good for you, as they are high in essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the health benefits of vegetables.
The sentence implies that John did not recognize the lady, which suggests that they were not acquainted. The other options, such as "pay debts," "slender," "free flowing," and "sparse," have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the violin is being played alongside many other instruments, which is a characteristic commonly associated with orchestras. Orchestras typically consist of a large number of musicians playing various string and wind instruments, including the violin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sun is the primary source of energy and light for our planet, which is necessary for all life on earth to exist. While it does provide warmth and heat, these are not the ultimate responsibility of the sun. A sun tan is a result of exposure to the sun's rays, but it is not a fundamental role of the sun. Light is also a result of the sun's energy, but again, it is not the ultimate responsibility of the sun.
The sentence indicates that Mandy has a desire to see distant places, which suggests that the correct answer may be a location that is far from her current location. The options "downtown area" and "centre of town" do not necessarily indicate a far distance. The option "bedroom" is also incorrect as it is not a location that Mandy can travel to. The options "Europe" and "big city" both suggest a far distance, but "Europe" is more specific and aligns better with the idea of distant places.
Squirrels are typically found living in woodland areas, as they are arboreal animals that require trees to climb and nest in. The other options do not make sense because Joe is a wild animal that would not be found in a pet store or cafe, and would not survive in the ocean. Though squirrels can sometimes be found in urban areas or parks, "outside" is too vague to be a correct answer.
A ficus is a type of indoor plant that typically requires a warm, humid environment with bright, indirect light. A conservatory is a type of room or greenhouse specifically designed for growing plants, making it the most likely option for a personal ficus to thrive. The other options do not provide the necessary conditions for a ficus, as they are either outdoor environments or lack the necessary humidity and light sources.
The sentence suggests that the shark was used in a legal setting as evidence, so it is most likely that the legal team brought it to a court room. The other options are unlikely and do not fit the context of the sentence. Shallow waters or a pond arena would not make sense as a place to present legal evidence, and sea world and a poker game also do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. It is where the President typically issues official decrees, executive orders, and other important statements. Banning snakes would require a formal government decision, and the White House would likely be the location where such a decision would be made. The other options, such as a street, tropical forest, or Garden of Eden, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. New Mexico may be a possible location for snakes, but it does not have any relevance to where the ban would be issued.
The sentence suggests that the individuals were looking down at something to search for rocks, which implies that they were focused on the ground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic to clean wounds. The most likely place for someone to keep antiseptic supplies would be in a medicine cabinet. The other options are unlikely places to find peroxide, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that you can borrow writings from this location, which indicates that it is a lending facility such as a library. Additionally, the presence of a dictionary alongside other writings suggests that this is a location where people come to read and borrow books, which is a characteristic of a library. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that getting in shape requires some sort of physical activity, which is commonly associated with exercise. Exercise is a critical component of improving one's physical fitness and is often recommended by healthcare professionals to promote overall well-being. While the other options may be important for maintaining good health and feeling better, exercise is generally considered to be the most important factor when it comes to getting in shape.
The sentence suggests that the statue has a function of shooting liquid, which is commonly associated with water fountains. Water fountains are often used as decorative features in public spaces, such as parks and plazas, and they typically have jets that shoot water into the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the child in question has a problem with hyperactivity, which may require them to learn techniques for controlling and calming their behavior. The most appropriate answer in this case is "calm," which is a direct opposite of hyperactivity. The other options, such as "park" or "safe," do not relate to the context of the sentence and would not help address the child's hyperactivity. "Being good" and "good behavior" are too general and do not specify an appropriate action to address hyperactivity.
The sentence suggests that John has a passion for painting houses, which implies that he is using a brush to apply paint onto the surfaces of the houses. The other options (clothes get stained, wallpaper, electrical circuit, draw) do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not have any clear connection to the act of painting houses.
The context of wiping feet on a doormat suggests that the entrance being referred to is a home. Out of the choices given, only "living room" is a common area found in a typical home entrance. "A chair" and "bathroom" are not typically found in home entrances, while "school" would not be relevant to the context of wiping feet on a doormat. "Doorway" is a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "living room" and could refer to any entrance.
The sentence implies that the book needs to be transported while traveling, and the options provided are all potential storage options. The library of congress and synagogue are unlikely choices for storing individual books while traveling. Pocket could work depending on the size of the book, but the most practical option for transporting a book would be either a backpack or suitcase. In this context, backpack is likely a better choice as it is more portable and easier to access while on the move.
The question seems to be a wordplay or a riddle, where the answer is a word that starts with the letter G and has gazelle in it. The given options are not the actual location of the gazelle, but rather a distraction. Knowing that a dictionary contains words arranged alphabetically and starting with the respective letter can help in selecting the correct answer in this case.
The sentence suggests that competing can have both positive and negative outcomes, and that these outcomes are related to winning or losing. Winning can bring great highs, such as a sense of accomplishment, pride, and recognition. Losing can bring great lows, such as disappointment, frustration, and a sense of failure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking what specifically blocks sunshine, which eliminates summer, park, desktop, and sea as options as they do not directly block sunshine. The moon, on the other hand, is known to block sunshine during a solar eclipse. Therefore, the correct answer is moon.
The sentence suggests that the option being looked for is a device that can be used to reduce the heat in a home. Among the choices provided, only air conditioning is commonly used for this purpose. A fan may help circulate air, but it does not reduce the temperature, while getting wet may provide temporary relief but is not a practical solution. Additionally, the terms "coolness" and "coldness" are not typically used to refer to specific devices or methods for cooling a house.
Pillow cases are typically items used in the bedroom, so it would make sense to store them in a drawer within the same space. The other options do not have any relevant connection to the context of the question. A kitchen cupboard is unlikely to be used for storing pillowcases, and the option "bedding store" is incorrect as it suggests storing the pillowcase in a retail location rather than in a personal space. Finally, the option "England" is completely unrelated and does not provide any helpful information for answering the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that the kitten needs to spend most of its time in a place where it can learn the skills to become a mouser like its mother. A farmhouse is a likely location for this, as it is commonly associated with rural settings where there are usually mice to be caught. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the man is purchasing silk, which is commonly associated with China as the country is known for producing high-quality silk. The other options such as space shuttle, theater, Indian restaurant, and bar do not have any clear connection to the context of silk purchasing.
A clavichord is a musical instrument, so it is likely that a teacher who owns one would keep it in a room specifically designated for music-related activities. The options "living room" and "parlor" are more general living spaces and not typically associated with specific activities. "Music hall" implies a larger public space, whereas a clavichord is usually a smaller instrument for personal use. "Museum" is not likely a place where someone would keep their personal instrument.
X-ray machines are commonly used in airports to scan and examine the contents of carry-on and checked baggage. The other options do not involve the use of x-ray machines for scanning.
The context of the sentence suggests that the couple is feeling secure in their relationship as they kiss each other goodbye. The mention of a "strong foundation" narrows down the answer choices to qualities that are commonly associated with stable relationships, such as trust. Trust is a fundamental aspect of any healthy relationship, and it would make sense for the couple to feel relaxed as they part ways if they have a strong level of trust in each other. The other options, such as partner, cooperation, bricks, or herpes, do not fit the context of the sentence or are irrelevant to the topic of relationships.
The word "commute" refers specifically to the act of traveling to and from work on a regular basis. The other options are more general and do not necessarily imply the regularity that is suggested by the word "commute". "Flying" implies air travel, which is not typically used for commuting. "Get somewhere" and "travel" could apply to any type of trip, not necessarily work-related. "Go home" implies the end of the workday, not the trip to work.
The question asks why someone who is hungry would go fishing, which implies that they are going fishing for food. The most logical reason to go fishing for food is to catch fish, which is the only option directly related to obtaining food from fishing. The other options are either unrelated to the goal of obtaining food or imply negative intentions towards the fish.
The sentence suggests that dogs are loyal and protective of their owners, which is often expressed through their tendency to defend them. Dogs are well-known for their protective instincts, and this option fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options (fleas, eat cake, attack, run fast) are not consistent with the idea of loyalty and protection, and are therefore unlikely to be correct.
The word "maze" suggests that the question is referring to a corn maze, which is a popular fall attraction on farms. To make a corn maze, the farmer would need to grow corn and then create a maze-like pattern within the cornfield. The other options do not relate to the creation of a corn maze.
The sentence suggests that males experience changes in their hair as they age, specifically thinning hair which causes a receding hairline. The other options - growing hair in the ear or bulging - do not relate to hair loss or aging. "Composted" is not a relevant option in this context. "Fall out" could be a potential answer, but "thin out" is a more specific and accurate description of the hair loss process.
The sentence suggests that playing poker poorly has negative consequences, which includes losing money. It implies that someone can play poker have options what to do in the game such as thinking or betting, but the outcome is negative if one is not good at it, which is represented by losing money. The other options are not relevant to the context of playing poker poorly.
The sentence clearly states that John loved his snake, indicating that the snake is his pet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fresh herbs, flowers, and vegetables are in danger of shriveling up, which is commonly associated with lack of water. This implies that people need to do something to prevent this, such as watering the plants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions Fort Wayne, which is a city in Indiana. The fact that the apples were picked from a tree outside of Fort Wayne suggests that the location is in close proximity to the city, reinforcing the likelihood that the answer is Indiana. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the janitor is cleaning up after religious services, which is typically held in a synagogue. The options "front porch," "classroom" and "grocery store" do not have any connection to religious services. "Obesity" is a medical term and does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that if you consume too many cocktails, there may be negative consequences the next day. The term "hang over" specifically refers to the physical symptoms that occur after drinking too much alcohol. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "sealed" suggests that the film was kept in a container. A cabinet is a type of container commonly used for storing film reels or tapes, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not make sense in this context. Clingfilm is used to wrap food, Disneyland is a theme park, and a cave is a natural formation, none of which would be a suitable place to store film. "Movie" is too broad and does not provide enough detail about where the film was found.
The phrase "much more than a drop of blood" suggests that the location is likely to be associated with a significant amount of blood spillage. Slaughterhouses are known for processing large numbers of animals and involve a significant amount of bloodshed during the process, making it the most likely option. Crime scenes and blood banks may have some blood spillage, but it is unlikely to be a large amount. Veins and needles are not locations and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "leaving the planet" suggests that the person is departing from Earth and entering a realm beyond Earth's atmosphere. The term "outer space" is commonly used to refer to this region. The other options do not accurately describe the location someone would end up after leaving Earth.
The sentence suggests that the town house was directly adjacent to the curb, with a slot serving as a mailbox. It is common for mailboxes to be located near the front door of a house for easy access by the postal service. The other options do not relate to this description of the town house's location and features.
The mention of a mezzanine and concerns about safety suggest that the architect and planning committee were likely discussing the design of a building with multiple levels, such as a theater or concert hall. The other options, such as actors, floors, or schools, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are less likely to involve levels or mezzanines.
The sentence suggests that the person was prepared for cold weather, which may indicate that they brought a warm coat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the act of learning about the world and understanding cultural norms requires a certain level of intellectual or philosophical understanding beyond just being smart or having an open mind. Enlightenment is often associated with gaining deep insights and understanding about the nature of the world and one's place in it, which aligns with the goal of understanding cultural norms and mores. Confusion and anger do not accurately reflect the desired outcome, while having an open mind and being smart may be helpful but not sufficient on their own.
Seeing a play is typically associated with being entertained, as plays are a form of entertainment that often feature dramatic or comedic performances. The other options do not relate to the typical experience of going to see a play - sitting is a passive action that doesn't convey any particular meaning in this context, jobless is irrelevant, meeting someone is not necessarily a defining characteristic of seeing a play, and laughter is only one possible reaction to a play (others might include sadness, contemplation, or awe).
Trade schools are typically focused on providing a specific vocational or technical education, often leading to the attainment of a degree or certification in a particular field. Ulcers, understanding, gaining knowledge, and happiness do not necessarily relate to the specific purpose of a trade school, which is to provide vocational or technical training.
The sentence suggests that Joan was a baby and couldn't do many things, which is a common characteristic of infants. Learning to walk is one of the major developmental milestones of a baby and can cause challenges for parents such as safety concerns and constant supervision. The other options are not related to difficulties associated with raising a baby.
The question is asking where you would put ham to cook it, which means that it needs to be stored in a place where it can remain fresh until it is cooked. The options hamshackle, pizza, and part of meal do not make sense in this context as they do not refer to storage or cooking. The options fridge and refrigerator are both valid choices as they are commonly used to store raw meats before they are cooked.
The sentence describes a situation that involves running errands with screaming kids, which is likely to cause some sort of negative emotional or mental impact. The word "screaming" suggests that the kids are not behaving well, which may cause the adult to become stressed or frustrated. The other options do not fit as well because they do not capture the negative impact that running errands with screaming kids would have.
The sentence suggests that Sam was not telling the whole truth and intentionally leaving out important details, which is a behavior commonly associated with being deceptive. Dishonesty, deceitfulness, and poker face all suggest more overt ways of misleading or withholding information, while imagination does not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the cause of someone committing murder, and the answer "killer" suggests that the person may have a predisposition or tendency towards violent behavior. The other answer choices do not necessarily indicate a direct cause of murder, but rather potential contributing factors such as distress or fear. "Go to jail" is not a cause of committing murder, but rather a consequence.
The word "leader" is commonly associated with groups or organizations that have a hierarchical structure. An army, for example, has a leader (usually a general), but it is not the only type of group that has one. A battle refers to a singular event, and while there may be leaders on both sides, the question is asking about a type of place, not an event. Wildlife and country do not necessarily have leaders, so the best answer is organization.
Communication typically involves the use of language and spoken words, so saying words is the most logical choice for how a person is likely to communicate with others. Meeting friends is a social activity that can involve communication, but it is not a direct answer to the question. Open mouth and thank god are expressions that do not necessarily involve communication with others. The last option, die of cancer, is entirely unrelated to the question.
The phrase "corner shop" typically refers to a small retail store, often located in a town or neighborhood. Buying pork chops from a corner shop implies that you are likely in a more urban or suburban setting, as opposed to a rural or desert location. England, Kentucky, and Iowa are all places where one might find a town with corner shops, but the word "desert" does not fit the context of the sentence.
A well used toy car is likely to be found in a child's room because that is where they would typically play with their toys. The other options, such as a boy's bedroom or own home, are also plausible but are more specific and may not always be accurate. The toy store option is unlikely as the car would have already been purchased and taken to the child's home. The house option is too general and could refer to any area within a house, making it an unlikely answer.
Fishing camps are typically locations where fishermen can set up camp and have access to amenities like cabins, bathrooms, and storage for their fishing equipment. Since the question is asking specifically about where fishermen can store their rods on a fishing trip, the most logical answer would be a fishing camp. The other options listed do not offer any specific storage options for fishing equipment.
The sentence implies that Danny values having fun over other things that are not fun, and that he is enjoying dancing and singing with his friends. The most reasonable choice that corresponds with his behavior and attitude is being happy. Injuries, glee, and jumping do not fit the context of the sentence, and while smiling may indicate happiness, it does not fully capture the idea that having fun is equivalent to being happy.
The term "water cooler" is commonly used to refer to a location in an office where employees gather to chat and take a break from work. This is a common scenario for office workers to gossip with their colleagues. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of an office setting where colleagues would be present to gossip with.
The word "packaged" suggests that the nails are already placed in some kind of packaging. The other options, such as pocket, cabinet, jar, or store, do not make sense in this context as they do not provide a suitable location for packaged nails. Container, on the other hand, is a logical choice since it generally refers to a receptacle used for storing or transporting objects, which can include packaged items.
The sentence implies that the person being referred to is skilled in sports. The word "talented" is commonly used to describe someone who has a natural ability or proficiency in a particular area, such as sports. On the other hand, the options "lazy" and "own house" do not relate to someone's athletic ability, while "affluent" and "reproduce" do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man's behavior at the funeral was inappropriate and not in line with what is expected. Funerals are somber events, where people gather to mourn and pay their respects to the deceased. Therefore, the man should have acted somber, respectful, and serious in his demeanor. The other options do not reflect the appropriate attitude expected at a funeral.
The sentence suggests that the student needs a new pencil sharpener since the one in the classroom is broken. The most logical place to find a pencil sharpener would be a stationery store, which is a place that sells writing and office supplies. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as going home or searching in a desk drawer would not solve the problem of the broken pencil sharpener.
The question is asking about where a child would sit at a desk, which implies an educational setting. The most likely place for a child to sit at a desk is in a schoolroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, as desks are not typically found in furniture stores or on patios, and children are not usually required to sit in an office building or library.
The sentence suggests that the person was attempting to have sexual relationships with multiple partners, which increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (stds). The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Soccer is a competitive sport, and winning often leads to a feeling of excitement among players and fans alike. The other options, such as getting tired or going into overtime, are possibilities during a soccer game, but they do not directly relate to the outcome of winning. Anger and fights may occur on occasion during a soccer game, but they are not a direct outcome of winning.
The sentence suggests that the attraction being referred to is so large that it requires a map to navigate, which is a common feature of large amusement parks. These parks often have many different rides, attractions, and areas, making it difficult to find your way around without a map. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a lack of cooperation between the speaker and their husband when it comes to housework. This could lead to frustration and tension, which often result in arguments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Boredom, headache, and exhaustion could potentially be consequences of doing too much housework alone, but they are not directly related to the lack of help from the husband. The option "park" is unrelated to the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the advertisement came in the form of a pop-up, which is a type of ad that appears suddenly on a web page. Pop-up ads are commonly associated with online advertisements, so the correct answer would be web page. The other options, such as store, bus, and email, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "La ville" is a French phrase that means "the city," but it does not provide any useful information in this context either.
The question is asking for a location where people live. "Apartment" is a common type of housing where people live, and "surface of earth" refers to the planet where humans live. The other options are not locations where people typically reside.
The sentence suggests that people behave differently towards strangers, which often includes being cautious or wary. The word "stranger" also implies that the people in question are not familiar to the speaker. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the juror was bored and zoning out, indicating that he was not actively engaged in taking notes or writing down anything. The phrase "just sat there" also implies a lack of action. However, the juror still wanted to convey that he was listening to the testimony, which could be achieved through nodding or other non-verbal cues indicating attentiveness. "Change of heart" is unrelated to the sentence, and "listening" is redundant as it has already been stated that the juror wanted to convey they were "hearing testimony."
The question suggests that the individuals are looking to try a specific type of fish, blowfish, meaning they would need to go to a location where they are sold. The options of Atlantic Ocean and aquarium would not provide the individuals with the ability to try the blowfish as they are not locations where they can purchase or consume the fish. France and books have no relevance to the context of the question so the correct answer is fish market.
The word "expedite" means to make something happen more quickly, which suggests that the answer is a term used to describe a route that allows for faster travel. The term "thruway" is often used to describe a major highway or roadway that is designed to provide direct and efficient travel between two points, making it the most applicable choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not describe a route or means of travel.
The term "universe" implies a vast and all-encompassing scope, suggesting that the person in charge has authority over everything. The other options are limited in scope and do not incorporate the concept of a universal domain.
The sentence explicitly states that the butt was bare, so the correct answer would be "bare." The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence specifies "many" stores with clothing, which suggests a location with multiple options. A mall is a common location for a variety of stores and a popular shopping destination, including clothing stores. The other options are not typically associated with clothing stores, except for possibly a department store, but a department store may not have as many clothing options as a mall. A drawer is too small of a space to hold many stores, and a library is not a place for shopping.
The word "working" suggests that the car was being repaired, and therefore the correct answer would involve the car starting to function properly again. The options "going too fast" and "go fast" imply that the car was already functioning properly, while "last several years" does not make sense in the context of repairing a car. "Honk the horn" is not related to the car's functionality.
The question implies that an elderly person requires assistance with everyday activities, which suggests that they may need to call upon someone to help fulfill these needs. A caregiver is a trained professional who provides assistance to individuals who require help with daily tasks due to age, illness, or disability. The other options (creativity, hatred, own house, much money) do not relate to the context of the question and are not relevant to the topic of caregiving.
The sentence suggests that people are watching a sport that involves sticks (likely hockey) and enjoying beer while doing so. Therefore, the correct answer is likely a location where one would typically watch a hockey game, such as in a bar or at the game itself. The other options, such as a refrigerator or a casino, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location in question is a place that has multiple rooms, where people may need to find phone numbers easily. Hotels are the most likely option because guests often need to look up phone numbers for amenities and services within the hotel, and there may be phone books provided in each room for this purpose. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence.
The keyword "driving" suggests that the answer should be related to areas that are typically visible from a car. The word "green field" suggests a grassy area, which is commonly found in rural or countryside areas. The other options could also have green fields, but they don't necessarily relate to areas seen while driving. For example, a meadow could be in a park or public area.
The context of the sentence suggests that the people who got escorted out of the library were making noise, as this behavior is often considered disruptive in a quiet study environment such as a library. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the pond is surrounded by trees, which would be more likely to be found in a forest than in a ground or bathroom. Additionally, the words "countryside" and "rural area" are very broad and could apply to many different environments, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
Blowfish are a type of fish that live in saltwater environments, such as oceans or seas. Therefore, they require sea water to survive. The other choices, such as hatred, fish market, or jungle, have no connection to the habitat or needs of a blowfish.
While there can be various negative side effects of consuming fast food like hamburger, death is highly unlikely to be an immediate side effect. The other options are more common side effects associated with consuming unhealthy and greasy food. Nausea, illness, and health problems may occur due to contaminated or excess consumption of this type of food, while gaining weight is a common result of consuming calorie-rich food like hamburger.
The question implies that the activity being described involves physically moving from one place to another while going to work. Therefore, the choice "walk" is the most plausible option. The other choices may be possible activities during a commute, but they do not align with the specific information given in the question. For example, "driving" is not applicable if the individual is described as walking, and "being late" is not an activity, but a consequence of poor time management.
The sentence mentions washers and refrigerators, which are both common appliances found in household kitchens. This suggests that the showroom is likely located in an appliance store, where customers can browse and purchase various kitchen appliances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man makes smart remarks about Mexican restaurants. Therefore, the answer would be a location that is associated with Mexican cuisine, making Mexico the correct choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for honey directly from where it is produced. Bees produce honey in beehives, so the correct answer would be "beehive." The other choices do not relate to directly obtaining honey from the source.
The options "apartment building," "city," and "town" may have a variety of flats to choose from, but the specific location mentioned in the sentence is London, so that is the most likely answer. The option "falling down" is not likely to have a variety of flats to choose from as it implies a run-down or dilapidated area.
The sentence suggests that a weasel has certain physical characteristics that help it burrow after prey. The options tree, mulberry bush, chicken coop, and viking ship do not seem like appropriate habitats for rabbits or for weasels to burrow after prey. A rabbit warren, on the other hand, is known for its numerous tunnels and burrows, which may make it an ideal habitat for weasels to pursue their prey.
The question implies that the subject of the sentence is something that can be destroyed by a disease. Diseases are known to attack living organisms, such as plants and animals, including humans. Out of the given choices, only the human body is a living organism that can be affected by a disease. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking about where a person from Avalon lives, which suggests that Avalon is a place. "English house" is a common term for a certain style of architecture, which is associated with England, suggesting that Avalon is located in England or has some connections to English culture. The other options, such as "pain," "meaningful work," and "cotton candy," do not make sense in the context of the question. "Headache" is a possible answer, but it does not fit as well as "English house" in the context of the question.
A fan for a stove is a common household appliance used to circulate air and improve heating efficiency. Therefore, it is most likely to be found in an appliance store where household items are sold. The other options (sports stadium, dress emporium, hot room, football stadium) have no connection to the context of the sentence and do not suggest any possibility of finding a fan for a stove.
The context suggests that Jodie is experiencing a physical symptom and is hesitant to seek medical attention. In such a scenario, going to a calm and familiar place like the bedroom might help alleviate some of the anxiety and discomfort. The other options do not seem to offer a suitable alternative for seeking medical help.
The context of the sentence suggests that the activity of buying beer for a float trip is associated with a leisure activity or recreation, which is commonly associated with having fun. The other options do not make sense in this context or are negative connotations.
The sentence states that marmots can be found on a piece of land in Canada, which narrows down the possible answers to North America and Vancouver Island. However, the United States and American are not accurate because they do not refer specifically to Canada. Cage is also not relevant because it does not relate to the topic of the sentence. Therefore, Vancouver Island is the correct answer as it is a specific location in Canada where marmots can be found.
The sentence suggests that the surgeon's clients are reducing in number because girls no longer want to do something. The options "reduction" and "make larger" do not fit the context of the sentence since they describe actions rather than the desired outcome. "Expand" and "gain weight" are also unlikely options since they are not commonly associated with the work of a surgeon. "Augment" is the most logical choice since it refers to the process of enhancing or increasing something, which could describe the desired outcome of a surgical procedure for girls.
The sentence suggests that people are waiting for an appointment while they read magazines, which is a common scenario in a doctor's office. People often read magazines to pass the time while waiting to see a healthcare professional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "made up" suggests that the fox is not real and exists only in fiction. Therefore, the most likely place to find a "made up" fox is in a storybook, which is a collection of fictional stories. The other options such as woods, hen house, natural habitat, and back yard are all associated with real-life locations where one might find real foxes.
The sentence suggests that in basic training, someone is initially built up, only to be torn down afterwards. This is a common practice in military training, where recruits are pushed beyond their physical and mental limits to prepare them for the rigors of military life. The other options, such as "destroying", "raze", "mutilate", and "demolition", do not accurately reflect the process of building up and tearing down in basic training.
The sentence states that Billy leaped up to a place where the dog couldn't reach him and got stuck. Kennel, porch, backyard, and park do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, a table is a piece of furniture that Billy could have leaped onto and got stuck, especially if it was unstable or hard to get down from. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely table.
The sentence suggests that John and Judy had a specific perspective on parenting, which is that guiding their children was a crucial part of their role as parents. While it is possible that they also believed in controlling their children's behavior to some degree, the emphasis on the children not always being well-behaved implies that they understood that children need guidance and support to grow and develop. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or are too vague to be a clear answer.
The sentence indicates that someone is playing something on a violin, which is a type of string instrument. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "make music" is too vague to be a definitive answer without additional information.
The sentence mentions that someone bought something and then gave it to the speaker as a free gift. This implies that the item was purchased with money, and therefore was paid for. The other options do not make sense in this context - "deadly" and "expensive" are not relevant to the cost status of a gift, while "imprisoned" and "in prison" are completely unrelated.
Flirting is often used as a way to attract someone's attention and express interest. However, choosing options like "have sex" or "get laid" is not necessarily a correct answer as it implies that the sole purpose of flirting is to have sexual encounters. Similarly, "were lonely" may be a reason why someone may flirt, but it is not a universal reason. "Dance" is also not a valid option as it has no clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions "crossing the channel from France," which suggests that James was likely traveling by sea. The options "river," "television," and "India" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, while "Europe" is too broad and does not specify a specific destination. "England" is the only option that is geographically close to France and makes sense as a logical destination for a boat crossing the channel.
The sentence suggests that the band is playing music, but there are no people nearby. This implies that they are not performing for an audience, but rather they are practicing their music. The other options (recording an album, holding a concert, playing music, and blaring) all involve playing music for some kind of audience or purpose, whereas practicing is something musicians do to improve their playing ability without any expectation of an audience.
The sentence strongly implies that the dogs were acting in a defensive or protective manner when they made their decision. The option "defend" is a similar word to the one used in the sentence and therefore a likely correct answer. "Run fast" and "ocean" are completely unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. "Bad breath" is a non-sequitur and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Attack" fits the context and is a likely correct answer.
The sentence implies that wheat needs to be ground in order to make bread, and the most common tool for grinding wheat is a mill. Farmers may grow wheat in their fields, but they typically do not grind it themselves. Cereal packets contain processed grains that have already been ground and are ready for consumption. Bread is the end product of the wheat-grinding process, not the tool used to grind it. The countryside is not relevant to the question, as it does not provide any information about the process of making bread.
The sentence suggests that if you have a large satchel when you fly, you will need to store it somewhere. The options "airport," "with the pilot," "room," and "clothing store" do not make sense in this context. The most likely place to store a large satchel while flying would be in the luggage compartment, which is where most large bags are stored during a flight.
The word "keep" suggests that the question is asking where someone would store or put their nylon leggings. "Stockings" are a type of legwear, but they usually refer to a thinner and more delicate material than nylon leggings. "Rope" and "car" are not typical storage locations for clothing. "Clothing" is too broad and doesn't specify a specific location. "Drawer" is a common storage location for clothing items like leggings.
The sentence suggests that the person is spending a long time running after a ball, which is likely to cause physical exertion and fatigue. Sweating and breathing heavily are also possible physical reactions to running, but tiredness is a more common and expected outcome of prolonged running. Laughter and embarrassment are unlikely responses to physical exertion.
Rest is typically needed when a person has depleted their energy levels and needs to recharge. The choice "using energy" closely aligns with this idea, indicating that the person has been truly active and has burned through considerable amounts of energy. The other options such as sleep, sleeping, action, and in motion, can be considered the result of fatigue and not necessarily the cause of it.
The sentence implies that the person in question was bored and hungry during a trip and that this led them to waste time and purchase unhealthy snacks. The most likely scenario where this could have happened is during a visit to a grocery store. The other options, such as "new moon," "play cards," "read book," and "see art," do not have any clear connection to the situation described in the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the person is worrying about not being able to get on the ride before closing, which implies that they have been waiting in a line or queue. The word "queue" also suggests waiting, making "waiting" the most likely answer. "Time" is also a logical option because it directly relates to waiting for an extended period. The other choices ("frustration," "hair," and "patience") are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a physiological consequence that is unavoidable when running. Since running is a physical activity that requires exertion, it is logical to assume that the consequence is related to the respiratory system. Breathlessness or shortness of breath is a common symptom for runners, especially if they are running at high intensity or for a prolonged period. The other options, such as muscle bulk or calluses, are not physiological consequences of running. Falling down is a possible consequence of running but is not a physiological one. Increased heart rate is a partial consequence of running but not the only one.
The sentence implies that there is someone who does not like water or being wet, but it is still necessary to ensure that they have a bath. The reason for this is likely related to hygiene, as baths are a common way to wash away dirt and bacteria from the skin. The answer "wet skin" is the only choice that directly relates to the benefits of taking a bath in terms of hygiene. The other options, such as flooding or drowning, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
An auditorium is a large room or space designed for public presentations or performances. The other options do not typically have auditoriums. A theater is a common place where individual speakers may give lectures or performances to an audience. The use of the word "single" suggests that there is only one person speaking, further indicating that it is likely to be a theater rather than a place with a "crowd" or "university campus." "Lights" and "park" do not clearly match the context of the sentence.
The phrase "keep on walking" suggests that the person needed to continue making progress in a certain direction in order to escape from their current location. "Moving forward" is the best choice because it specifically describes the act of progressing in a forward direction. The other options (locomotion, blisters, rollerskate, and exercise) are either unrelated or only tangentially related to the idea of progressing forward.
The sentence suggests that the bees are in a natural environment that is large, hence it is likely that the correct answer would be something related to nature. The reference to the western citizens is likely a red herring to throw off the reader. The options "space station" and "trash can" are unlikely because they are not related to nature. The option "bouquet of flowers" is too small to contain a large group of bees, leaving "field of flowers" as the most appropriate and likely answer.
The sentence mentions that Miss Grady took a stick from Bob during class, which suggests that the location where she put the stick was likely within the classroom. The options "kitchen drawer" and "office" are unlikely because they suggest a location outside of the classroom. "Pocket" is also unlikely because it would not be a secure location if Miss Grady wanted to make sure that Bob could not get to it. Therefore, "desk drawer" is the most sensible option, as it is a secure location within the classroom.
Reproduction involves the fusion of a sperm cell from a male and an egg cell from a female, which usually occurs through sexual intercourse. Genetic mutation refers to a change in DNA that can lead to variation in offspring, but it is not usually the mechanism by which reproduction occurs. Kissing, flirting, and going on a date may be part of the process leading up to reproduction, but they are not the actual act of reproduction itself.
The sentence suggests that Joe and Jill are concerned about their children being inactive, which may lead to sedentary behavior. Watching TV is a common sedentary activity that involves sitting in one place for extended periods of time. Play sports, throw things, and playing with toys are all physical activities that would encourage movement and reduce sedentary behavior. Reading could be either sedentary or active, depending on the circumstances. However, the sentence specifically implies that Joe and Jill are worried about their children being sedentary, so watching TV is the best answer.
The sentence suggests that the process being described involves fermenting cabbage to create sauerkraut, which is often done in jars. The instructor mentions that the liquid should be above the cabbage, indicating that the cabbage should be fully submerged in the liquid to properly ferment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The kitchen is typically the place where cups are stored and used for drinking. The dishwasher is where cups are cleaned after use, not where they are normally taken from to get a drink. The water fountain is a public drinking source that does not involve cups. The sand box and toilet are not appropriate places from which to take a cup.
The sentence describes speakers being strapped on the ears, which is a common way of describing the use of headphones. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question was too angry to explain something clearly. Therefore, the correct answer must be an action that would require clear explanation. "Illustrate point" is an action that requires clear communication and explanation, making it the correct answer. "Cool off" and "write letter" could be possible actions to take after calming down, but they do not necessarily require clear explanation. "Get mad" and "destroy enemy" do not align with the context and are too extreme in comparison to the other options.
The question asks for a location that is unlikely to have a kosher restaurant, which means we need to eliminate options that are more likely to have one. Jerusalem and Jewish neighborhoods are both associated with the Jewish faith and culture, so it's likely that they would have kosher restaurants. New York City has a large Jewish population and is known for its diverse food culture, so it's also likely to have kosher restaurants available. "Dining in" doesn't specify a location, but it generally refers to eating at home instead of at a restaurant, so it's a safe choice for an option that is unlikely to have a kosher restaurant.
Mount St. Helen's and Puget Sound are both located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Therefore, it is more likely that the bald eagle would fly all over the Pacific Northwest rather than other geographic locations like Utah or the desert. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks where you could obtain knives to bring outside with you, which suggests that you are looking for knives suitable for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or hunting. Sporting goods stores typically sell a range of outdoor equipment, including knives specifically designed for these types of activities. The other options (backpack, kitchen, sharp edges, dog house) are not places where you would commonly find knives suitable for outdoor use.
The sentence is referring to people fulfilling their calorie requirements, which is typically accomplished by consuming food. Therefore, the correct answer is "feed themselves." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Stoves are typically used to generate heat, whether through gas or electric power sources. The options "cool house," "gas or electric," and "burn child" are not accurate descriptions of what a stove does to the place it's in. While stoves can be used for cooking, the option "brown meat" does not capture the primary purpose of a stove, which is to generate heat. Therefore, "warm room" is the correct answer.
Going into trance often involves a state of relaxation and focus, and many techniques involve closing one's eyes to shut out external distractions and increase internal awareness. Religious experiences and hallucinations may be related to trance in some contexts, but they are not necessarily the best ways to initiate the state. Loss of control and sleep may also be associated with trance, but they do not provide specific guidance on how to begin the process.
The context of the sentence suggests that the computer user is working on an important work assignment, indicating that they are either an employee or a freelancer. It is unlikely that someone working on a work assignment would do so in a location like an internet cafe, which is a public space that may not provide the necessary level of privacy and security. A house or school may be possible locations, but an office building is the most likely option since it is a dedicated space for work-related activities. The option "internet cafe" is repeated and therefore, incorrect.
The use of the word "festive" suggests that the context may be related to a celebration or a party atmosphere. The mention of horses dancing in circles is likely referring to a carnival or circus, which often feature horses performing in shows. The other options, such as night club, theater, and opera, do not have a clear connection to the context of horses dancing in circles. Ringmaster may be somewhat related, but it is not clear whether the context involves a circus or carnival.
The sentence mentions an "auditorium" and a "mezzanine" which are both commonly associated with theaters. A mezzanine is a level intermediate between the main floor and the next higher floor, and is often found in theaters to provide additional seating. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is not well rested and it is a rainy day, which may imply that they do not need to go out or do something active. Instead, they might want to stay in bed and relax. The other options may not be as appropriate because they do not necessarily promote rest and relaxation.
The question implies that the person does not live in a detached dwelling, which suggests they may live in a multi-unit building like an apartment. In an apartment, a stove would typically be located in the kitchen, whereas in other options like a tent or car, this would not be the case. The living room and friend's house options are also unlikely locations for a stove, as they are not designated areas for cooking.
Revolving doors are commonly found in malls and other commercial buildings. Additionally, malls typically have a variety of stores and items available for purchase. Public places, banks, and supermarkets may also have revolving doors, but the presence of things to buy is more closely associated with a mall. New York is a city and does not inherently have a revolving door or things to buy in it.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a location where books can be read. While books can be stored on a shelf or in a cabinet, they cannot be read there. Similarly, books cannot be read in a backpack or a sink. A table, however, is a surface commonly used for reading, studying, and writing, making it the most likely option for the correct answer.
Seaweed is a type of marine plant that grows in the ocean, so the correct answer is "ocean". The other options may be technically correct, but they are not as specific as "ocean" and do not convey the same level of accuracy.
The sentence suggests that the lizard is being regularly fed by people, which is a behavior that is commonly observed in captive animals. Animals in the wild typically need to forage for food and are not reliant on humans for their survival. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that if someone's spirits cannot elevate, they will likely experience a negative emotion or state. "Depress" is the closest choice to this idea, as it means to make someone feel sad or hopeless. "Sadden" and "drop" are similar, but do not carry the same connotation of a prolonged or chronic state. "Demote" and "decrease" do not fit the context of the sentence at all.
The question is asking about obtaining a license to catch crabs, which suggests that the office responsible for granting such licenses would be related to fishing or marine life. The option "fish department" is the most relevant choice as it directly refers to an office that deals with fish and marine life. The other options, such as "government submarine" or "fancy restaurant," are not related to the context of the question and are therefore incorrect.
A side chair is typically placed in a room for sitting and relaxation, and it is common to find a table or a small side table nearby to hold things like books, drinks, or lamps. The other options such as bedroom, wheel barrow, building or office do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that metal is used to create something specific, and the most logical option among the choices is instruments. This is because instruments are commonly made using metal, especially those that require durability and strength, such as brass and percussion instruments. The other options do not have as strong of a connection to the use of metal, as a junkyard may contain metal but does not require its use, ore is a raw material, a metal fabrication shop is a place where metal is worked on, and bowls may be made with various materials.
Manchester is a city located within the county of Lancashire in England. Adding "Lancashire" to Manchester indicates its location within that county. The other options either refer to a larger geographical region (England, United Kingdom) or a different county (Cheshire or Greater Manchester).
The sentence suggests that the amateur end user was having trouble with the program and was experiencing negative emotions because of it. "Get mad" is a possible response, but not the only one, and there is no indication in the sentence that the user was actively trying to fix the errors (compile, debug, write code). "Get frustrated" is the most likely choice because it accurately reflects the user's emotional state and does not imply any specific actions.
The sentence implies that being on the surface of the sun would cause harm to a person. One of the forms of energy that the sun produces is heat which is known to be an extreme form of temperature that can quickly cause harm and even kill people. The other options such as ocean, life on earth, wrinkles, and light do not have any relation to the context of the sentence and are not relevant to the question.
The sentence implies that lawyers are frequently in a situation where they speak to a potentially large group of people. The most likely scenario where this would occur is in a courtroom, where lawyers argue their cases in front of a judge and jury, and potentially a gallery of spectators. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James bought tire chains for his vehicle and put them in a place where he could easily find them when needed. It is logical to assume that the most appropriate place to store tire chains would be in a garage, where the vehicle is usually parked. The other options do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions that the item is made from plants and needs to be washed, which narrows down the options to parts of plants that are typically eaten and require washing before consumption. Out of the choices, only leaves gather light as part of the process of photosynthesis and fit the criteria of being edible and requiring washing. The other options, such as roots and millions of cells, do not necessarily need to be washed and are not commonly eaten as food.
The sentence suggests that planting Ficus in a yard will create an area that provides relief from the heat of summer. This is a characteristic commonly associated with shady places, as they offer protection from direct sunlight and lower temperatures. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that children's behavior is influenced by something or someone, and in this case, it is directly connected to their parents. Parents are the primary caregivers and role models for children, and their behavior and actions can significantly impact a child's upbringing and development. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the people being referred to are family members, and that they have a common way of greeting each other. The option "hug" is a common way for family members to show affection towards each other, making it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John already had an old water hose that he thought was lost or missing. The most likely place for him to find it would be in a storage area for outdoor or gardening equipment, such as a garage or a garden shed. The other choices, like a hardware store or greenhouse, do not make sense in the context of the sentence as places where John could find his old water hose.
A control room is a specialized facility where a number of personnel can monitor and control the operations of a complex system or process, such as a nuclear plant. This is important for safety reasons, as nuclear plants can pose serious risks if not operated properly. The other options do not typically require a control room for the same reasons that a nuclear plant does.
Common practice when eating pizza is to place the slice on a plate before eating it. This helps to prevent the pizza from getting cold or soggy, as well as making it easier to eat with utensils if desired. The other options do not make sense in the context of keeping a pizza slice before eating it.
The sentence suggests that a group of people are preparing to perform on stage, which is commonly associated with a theater setting. The dressing room is typically located backstage in a theater, and people change into costumes there before going on stage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the homeowner was concerned about the cost of gas, which suggests that they may have to save money in other areas. Property tax payments are a common expense associated with owning a home, so it makes sense that the homeowner would have to deal with this task later. The other options do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the words "fields" and "woods" in the sentence suggest that the thoroughfare is passing through a rural area or the countryside. The other options, such as city, town, or New York City, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are more indicative of urban or suburban environments. The phrase "meandered through" also implies that the thoroughfare is taking a more winding route, which is more characteristic of a rural setting than an urban one.
The question is asking about where to go to buy a new ottoman, which is a type of furniture. The most logical choice from the options provided is therefore a furniture store, as that is where one would typically go to purchase furniture. The other choices do not relate to buying furniture, and are either rooms in a house (living room, den) or a location (parlor, turkey) that has no connection to furniture shopping.
The sentence suggests that Sean was leaving work and took a specific roadway to get somewhere. The most logical option based on this context would be his neighborhood, as it is a common destination for people leaving work. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that there is a method or tool for catching a jellyfish. The most practical option listed is using your hand. The other choices are bodies of water, which do not provide any information on how to catch a jellyfish.
The description mentions a "shelf," which is a feature commonly found in bookcases. Bookcases often have several shelves to hold books, and they may have doors or other features that obscure the contents of the shelves. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the description.
Stabbing someone to death is a serious crime and is punishable by law. Therefore, it is highly likely that the perpetrator will be arrested for committing this offense. The other options are related to the violent and gory nature of the act and its aftermath. While these may also occur after stabbing someone to death, the most immediate consequence is being arrested.
The sentence mentions a river, which suggests that the location is likely to be a jungle or rainforest environment, where rivers are common. The fear of blowfish is also more likely to be relevant in a jungle environment, as blowfish are known to inhabit freshwater rivers and streams, while piranhas are actually more commonly found in the Amazon River basin. The other options, such as Cuba or the Atlantic Ocean, do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The word "office" typically refers to a place where people work or conduct business, and schools often have administrative offices for staff members. Skyscrapers and cities may have many offices, and the option "work" is too general and could refer to any place of employment. New York may have a lot of offices, but it is not specific enough to answer the question.
Being a religious gentleman typically involves engaging in activities and practices associated with a particular religion, such as attending worship services, prayer, and acts of service. Churches are typically the primary location where religious activities are carried out, making it the most appropriate choice among the given options. The other options, such as a club, restaurant, university, or pub, do not have any clear connection to religious activities or practices.
The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to see a prepared slide in detail, which is something that can be accomplished with a microscope. Microscopes allow us to view tiny objects, such as cells or microorganisms, by making them appear larger than they actually are. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence: "abbreviate" means to shorten a word or phrase, "glasses" are used for vision correction, "camera" captures images, and "telescope" is used to view distant objects.
A newsstand is a common place to buy magazines, newspapers and gum. It is a small structure or booth that is typically found on a busy street or in a train station. Banks, beds, and bus depots are not typically associated with selling these items. A rack could refer to a magazine rack, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
A lumberyard is a common place to purchase wood, while the other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Carpet, boat, and synagogue are all unrelated to obtaining wood, while a river may have some trees along its banks but is not a reliable source for acquiring wood.
The sentence suggests that the pitcher was on a sports field or playing surface, which can be inferred from the terms "mound" and "diamond". The choices "desert", "hell", and "baseball stadium" do not fit the context, while "baseball field" and "baseball diamond" both accurately describe the playing surface in a game of baseball. However, "baseball diamond" is a more common term used to refer to the field and is therefore the correct answer.
The question suggests that playing chess on a cold day can have a negative effect on the body. Frostbite is a serious medical condition that can occur when the body is exposed to extreme cold temperatures. The other options, such as enemies, performing better, sweating, and tension, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the main reason why a young child would find it hard to read a long book is because of the amount of words in it. Young children typically have a shorter attention span and may struggle to focus on a longer text, especially if it contains a lot of words. The other options, such as knowledge or the cover design, are not as relevant to the reading difficulty associated with a long book.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for something cool and sweet to enjoy on a hot day. Eating ice cream is a common activity on hot days as it provides a refreshing and sweet treat. The other options do not offer a similar experience or do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for something that is not a foreword, which is typically found at the beginning of a book and provides introductory information or background about the book's content. The other options listed are typically found at the end of a book and provide summary, reflection, or additional information. Only the option "ikea instructions" is clearly not a literary element and would not be found in a book unless it is an instruction manual or guide for assembling furniture.
A day consists of 24 hours, and this is a common knowledge that most people are aware of. The other options do not have any clear connection to the question or time measurement.
The question suggests that there is a difficulty in understanding religion, indicating that it may be something that is beyond human comprehension. The word "unknowable" means something that cannot be fully understood or comprehended, which fits with the idea that religion is difficult to understand. The other options do not fit with the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the couple is struggling with communicating effectively, and that it takes a lot of work to have a conversation. The word "effort" is commonly associated with hard work, which makes it the most suitable option. "Thinking" and "medium" do not accurately reflect the idea of difficulty in communication. "Laugh" suggests a positive tone, which is not consistent with the situation described. "Force" implies aggression, which is not mentioned in the sentence.
The question mentions a captain who dies at sea, suggesting that it is related to nautical terminology. In maritime law and practice, if a captain dies at sea, someone needs to take charge of the ship and navigate it to safety. Therefore, the correct answer would be "man crew" since the remaining crew members would need to take over the responsibilities and tasks of the captain. The other options are unrelated to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that children need something to grow up healthy, which is commonly associated with the need for care. Children require attention, support, and guidance from adults to develop physically, emotionally, and mentally. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the house is located outside the center of a community, which implies that it is situated in a residential area rather than in the city or on a street. "Subdivision" is a possibility, but it is less clear than "residential area," as it could refer to a specific type of neighborhood rather than just a general area where people live. "Newspaper" is not a possible answer as it does not relate to the context of the sentence at all.
The sentence suggests that the field general was preparing to write a letter to the king and was given specific instructions for what to send when the enemy was near. The options "syllable," "English alphabet," "email," and "invitation" do not have a clear connection to this context. "Word" makes the most sense as a possible instruction for the field general to send when the enemy was near, as it could be a signal to take action or convey important information quickly.
The sentence is asking for a way to prevent a pen from drying out, which suggests that the pen has already been filled with ink. Caps are a common way to prevent ink from drying out, as they create a seal that keeps air from getting to the ink. The other options do not address the issue of drying out specifically or are not practical solutions for preventing a pen from drying out.
The fact that the explorer climbed mountains before finding the cave suggests that the region where the cave was found was hilly or mountainous. Of the given choices, only rocky hills fit this description. West Virginia and Kentucky are both known for their Appalachian Mountains, which are hilly and rocky. The desert and sea options do not match the rocky terrain found in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the people referred to in the sentence were conducting experiments with combustible mixtures, which is something that typically occurs in a chemistry lab. In such labs, it is important to have fire safety measures in place, including fire extinguishers, since chemicals can be highly flammable and potentially dangerous. The other answer choices might have fire extinguishers as well, but they are not necessarily specific to dealing with combustible mixtures, which is the main focus of the sentence.
The word "fruit" is sometimes used as a derogatory term for gay men, so using it as an insult in a gay bar would be particularly inappropriate and offensive. The other options (market, grocery store, refrigerator, container) do not have any clear connection to the context of using "fruit" as an insult.
A toothpick is typically packaged and sold in a box or container, making this the most logical option. The other choices (grocery store, eyes, chewing, mouth) do not make sense in the context of obtaining a toothpick.
The question suggests that the place being designed is intended for an annoying critter to stay. The options "spread disease," "swamp," and "fly away," do not fit this description as they either describe negative or unrelated concepts. "Cat condo" also does not fit as it is intended for a different type of animal. "Bug campers" is the most likely answer as it suggests a place for bugs to stay and also implies that the bugs will be mobile, or able to travel, which fits with the idea of annoying critters that need to be kept away.
The sentence suggests that the single bee that the man swatted away quickly became more than one bee. The word "swarm" is commonly used to describe a large group of bees, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Hiking requires physical activity and exertion, as it involves walking on a trail or rough terrain for an extended period of time. Therefore, the answer must correlate to the physical aspect of hiking, and physical exertion is the most relevant choice among the options provided. The other choices do not address the necessary physical requirements for hiking, such as wearing appropriate footwear and clothing, staying hydrated, and taking breaks when necessary.
Sporting goods stores specialize in selling equipment for sports and outdoor activities. The other options are not likely to have a significant amount of sports equipment for sale. Malls typically have a variety of stores, but sports equipment is not their main focus. Office supply stores are for office supplies and equipment, and schools are educational institutions that do not typically sell sports equipment. A sporting event is a temporary event and not a type of store.
The sentence suggests that the business man wanted to purchase an expensive wristwatch to celebrate his recent promotion. The logical place to buy a high-end wristwatch would be a jewelry store, as they typically carry luxury watches. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the child is eager to go and play, which implies a sense of excitement and urgency. Rushing would be the most appropriate way for the child to get to the place where they can play as quickly as possible. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, such as slowly or being entertained, which suggest a lack of urgency or a focus on something other than playing.
The sentence suggests that the buying products are related to financial assistance for those who have no money. The implication is that the product will show the user how to manage their financial situation, starting with declaring their debt. The other options are not related to financial assistance or managing one's money, and are therefore not appropriate answers.
The context of the question suggests that the subject is looking for a replacement handle for an ax, an item typically found in a hardware store. The other options (bathroom, water fountain, grocery store, fridge) do not have any connection to the context of the question and would not be places where one would typically find a replacement ax handle.
The comparison in the sentence is between the person's behavior and that of a clown, which implies that the behavior may be seen as comical or absurd. The word "ridiculous" fits this context and suggests that the person is acting foolishly. The other options do not match the tone of the sentence or the implied comparison between the person's behavior and that of a clown.
Louisiana is located in the southern region of the United States, which is commonly referred to as the "Deep South." However, the question specifically mentions "states," suggesting that Louisiana belongs to a larger group of states. The term "Gulf States" refers to the states that are located along the Gulf of Mexico, including Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Therefore, "Gulf States" is the most appropriate choice to answer the question. The other options are either too specific (98 of world's crayfish) or too general (United States, Bible Belt) and do not provide a clear answer to the question.
After eating from a plate, it is common to either wash it and put it in the dishwasher or dry it off and place it in the kitchen cupboard for future use. The other options do not make sense in this context, as placing a dirty dish on a table or floor would be unsanitary and flea market is not a location for dishes.
The sentence suggests that James is having trouble getting comfortable, which is typically associated with sleeping or resting. The mention of dirt also implies that the discomfort is due to a dirty bed. The other options (ground, subway, bank, street) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the rats were hiding in a part of the house that is likely dark and enclosed, which suggests a basement or cellar. The other options - sewers, laboratory, clinic - are typically not located inside a house, and so are less likely to be the location of the rats.
The question is asking about a behavior that people exhibit when they are confused or don't understand something. Asking questions is a common strategy that people use to clarify and gain more knowledge about a particular topic or concept. The other options do not relate to the context of the question and are unlikely to be behaviors associated with confusion or lack of understanding.
The sentence states that James traced the string back to its origin, indicating that he was the one who had been holding the string. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as there is no mention of someone else holding the string or buying it from a store.
The sentence mentions a rubber toy filled with helium, which is a clear reference to a balloon. Balloons are commonly associated with children's parties, and their colorful and lightweight nature often brings joy to kids. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people are gambling and then getting beer, which indicates that the location must be a place where both activities are commonly found. Casinos often serve alcohol and are well-known for gambling, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the use of television is boring or uninteresting, which can lead to a state of drowsiness or falling asleep. This is a common experience for many people who have found themselves watching TV with nothing interesting or engaging to hold their attention. The other options do not relate directly to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the business men left a discussion and now want to relax in a sauna. A sauna is typically found in a bathhouse or a spa, making the option "bathhouse" the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Ivy plants are often seen growing on walls or structures outside, as they have a tendency to attach themselves to surfaces using small roots. While they can also be grown indoors in a flower pot or on a windowsill, their natural habitat is typically outside. The other options, such as a shelf or sill, do not provide the necessary support for ivy plants to grow and thrive.
A stoop is a set of steps leading up to a raised entrance of a building. Brownstones are a type of row house commonly found in certain cities, such as New York and Boston, which have a distinct stoop leading up to the front door. Hotels, condominiums, entering buildings, and office buildings may have entrances with steps, but they are not typically referred to as a stoop, making brownstone the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that there is a texture issue with the wood. The word "smooth" implies that the surface of the wood should be free of any roughness or irregularities. Of the given options, only "porous" refers to a texture that is not smooth. Porous wood has small holes or pores on the surface, which make it less smooth to the touch. The other options do not describe a lack of smoothness in texture, or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the potential consequence of not losing weight, which suggests that the person may have previously been overweight or obese. When someone loses a significant amount of weight, their skin can become loose and saggy because it has lost the elasticity that was previously stretched out. This is a common concern for people who are trying to lose weight, especially if they are losing a large amount of weight quickly. The other options are not logical consequences of not losing weight, with "miss universe" and "healthier" being positive outcomes rather than negative ones, and "death" being an extreme and unlikely consequence in most cases.
The sentence suggests that Billy originally lived in a large city, which is typically associated with being the capital of a country. If he moved from the city, it would make sense that he would move to a smaller town or city, rather than jail or a place associated with governmental activities. "Lowercase" is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the process of making a schedule was easy, but there was a specific aspect related to the major that required additional knowledge. The word "major" indicates that this is likely related to a course of study in higher education, and the use of the word "class" is commonly associated with college courses. The other options, such as color or encyclopedia, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that getting in shape requires some kind of physical activity, which can have a positive effect on the body. Jogging is a form of exercise that is known to improve cardiovascular health, burn calories, and strengthen muscles, which makes it a good choice for someone who wants to get in shape. Eating more or giving up on exercise altogether would not have a positive effect on someone's fitness goals, and starving oneself is never a healthy or sustainable approach. A period of recovery may be necessary after a workout, but it is not something that "does wonders" for getting in shape.
The question is asking for the factor that could physically prevent a driving car from continuing to drive. The choice of "low fuel tank" makes sense because it could cause the car to come to a complete stop and be unable to continue driving. The other options may affect the driver's ability to continue driving (such as backache or smoke), but would not physically prevent the car from moving forward. Automobile accidents, while a potential cause for a car to stop moving, are not a preventative factor that could stop a car from continuing to drive, and pollution is not directly related to the function of a car.
The word "container" implies a large object that needs to be stored somewhere. The options "supermarket," "juice," "hostel," and "cabinet" do not make sense as places to store large containers. A factory, however, is a place where large items are often stored, as it is a space dedicated to industrial production and manufacturing.
The sentence suggests that the person who is no longer married to a mean person may experience something positive as a result. Given the negative connotation of the word "mean," it is likely that the person will feel relieved to be free from the negativity and mistreatment associated with the previous relationship. The other options are less likely because they do not correspond well with the context of the sentence. For example, "isolation" doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that the person is no longer married to someone mean, and "angry" is not a typical response to an end of a bad relationship.
The sentence suggests that there were many people around, but the man still felt a certain way. The choices "small group," "solitary," and "solitude" all suggest a lack of other people around, which contradicts the initial sentence. "Panic" suggests a strong reaction to the crowds, but the sentence suggests that the man's mood is more subdued. "Alone" is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a feeling of isolation and detachment even when surrounded by others.
The word "maid" suggests that the context of the sentence is related to housekeeping or cleaning services. Motels typically have housekeeping staff who clean the rooms and empty trash cans. The other options (bus stop, corner, hockey game, and alley) do not have any clear connection to this context.
The phrase "tuckered out" suggests that the dog is tired or exhausted, which is commonly associated with physical activity. Of the given choices, "walked" is the most physically demanding option for a dog, while the other choices do not necessarily require a lot of physical energy. "Petted" and "affection" are emotions that do not cause physical exhaustion, while "go outside" and "scratch" do not necessarily involve physical activity.
The sentence indicates that the person was using an umbrella while tanning, which suggests they were seeking shade from the sun. The most likely location for this scenario is a beach, where people often use umbrellas or other types of shade to protect themselves from the sun while enjoying the sand and water. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence as well - waves, seattle, suitcase, and jacket closet don't have any clear connection to the use of an umbrella while tanning.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the appearance of bird feathers in the rainforest. Rainforests are known for being home to many colorful and exotic bird species, so it's likely that the feathers of the birds found in the rainforest are also very colorful. The other options do not provide any relevant information or connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the sentence is referring to a specific group of people who were known for seafaring and using pelts. The word "Norse" indicates that the group is likely from Scandinavia, and "viking ship" is the most logical choice for a transportation method for this group. The other options are unrelated and do not make sense in the given context.
The sentence suggests that the word being sought refers to the opposite of an "area of elevation." An area of elevation is typically a high point, such as a mountain or hill, while a depression is a low point or dip in the ground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Singers typically need to warm up their vocal cords to prepare for a performance. This helps to prevent strain or injury to their voice and ensures that they are able to perform at their best. Using microphones and clearing throats are common practices as well, but they are usually part of the actual performance rather than preparation. Creating music and sounding beautiful are general characteristics of being a singer, but they do not specifically relate to what singers need to do before a show.
The sentence suggests that medication and therapy have been effective in improving the mental illness of the person mentioned. "Cause irrational behaviour," "recur," and "cause suffering" all suggest negative outcomes and do not fit with the idea of successfully managing a mental illness. "Managed" could be a possible answer, but "effectively treated" implies a more positive and successful outcome.
The phrase "performing for the first time" suggests that the person in question is likely inexperienced or nervous. It is common for people to feel anxious or nervous before a new experience or performance, especially if they are not used to being in the spotlight or performing in front of others. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the typical emotional response to performing for the first time.
The question is referring to the act of committing murder, which means intentionally causing someone's death. The other options (misery, distress, tickle) do not align with the severity of the crime being discussed. The last option (go to jail) is a consequence of committing murder, not an action that was taken towards someone else.
The sentence suggests that the computer was connected to the internet, which means it can receive data from the internet. Processing information is a general function of a computer, but it is not specific to being connected to the internet. Believing in God and making decisions are not related to the technical capabilities of a computer.
The sentence implies that Mercury is not hospitable to human beings. The word "unsuitable" suggests that there is a characteristic of the planet that makes it challenging for humans to live there. Mercury is too close to the sun, so it has extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation levels that are harmful to humans, making it uninhabitable. The other choices, such as "toxic," "poisonous," and "mercury sulphide," do not suitably answer the question and may mislead the individuals. "Jupiter" is a gas giant and cannot support human life.
The sentence suggests that the person was nervous or anxious as they got closer to realizing their dream of being on stage. This feeling is common among performers or public speakers who may experience stage fright or performance anxiety. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location of the creek is opposite to the city, which implies that it is in a rural or natural environment away from urban development. Out of the given choices, countryside is the only option that fits this description. A meadow is generally a flat, open area of land with grass and flowers, stick does not make logical sense in this context, a valley is a low point between the mountains or hills, and a forest refers to a large area of trees or woods. None of these options specifically suggest a location opposite to the city.
Anemones are sea creatures commonly found in tide pools, which are shallow pools of seawater that are left behind when the tide recedes. They are known for their colorful tentacles and resemble flowers, which may explain why they are called anemones. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to find anemones.
Traveling clothes are typically kept in a suitcase, as this is where people store their clothing when they are on the go. A bedroom or closet may be where the suitcase is kept, but the traveling clothes themselves are not typically stored in these locations. Draws and dressers are both types of furniture that can be used for clothing storage, but they are not commonly used for traveling clothes specifically.
The sentence suggests that in order to get a key to access a bathroom, the person needs to buy something from a particular location. The most likely location for this would be a convenience store, as they often have public restrooms and require a purchase to receive a key or access code. The other options, such as schools and theaters, typically have free restrooms or do not require a purchase to access them. Rest areas and malls may have restrooms that require a key or code, but it is less common for them to require a purchase.
The sentence suggests that the pessimist warned everyone about something negative that the sun would do, which eliminates options like lay, go down, below, and sundown because they all describe the natural setting of the sun. The word "fall" suggests that the pessimist is warning everyone about a negative event that the sun will cause, like a drop in temperature or the onset of bad weather. Therefore, "fall" is the most logical answer.
The sentence suggests that the person needed to make room for the tall hardcovers on a piece of furniture that had shelves. A bookcase is the most likely option for this because it is a piece of furniture specifically designed to hold books, which often come in varying sizes. The other options, such as a grocery store or a chest of drawers, do not make sense in this context.
Comedy is a genre of entertainment that is meant to elicit laughter from the audience. Therefore, if you are watching a comedy film, you would expect to hear laughter from the audience. The other options do not make sense in this context. For instance, parks are typically associated with outdoor recreational activities, insight refers to gaining knowledge, being entertained could involve various forms of engagement, and fear is associated with horror or suspense genres.
The sentence suggests that eating lunch can cause a painful symptom. Heartburn is a common symptom caused by eating certain foods, especially those that are spicy or acidic. The other options may cause discomfort but are not specifically related to eating lunch.
The sentence suggests that the performer is stepping onto a launch platform, which is a common feature of a trapeze act where the performer launches themselves into the air. Cape Canaveral Florida and NASA are related to space launches and not to the context of the sentence. Battleships and oceans are also not related to the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the body doesn't use all the food that is eaten, suggesting that some of it will be expelled from the body. The only option that relates to this context is defecating, which refers to the process of expelling waste from the body. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that paying for a pizza implies that you are in a place where pizzas are prepared and served commercially. "Restaurant" is the correct answer because it is a type of establishment where food is served and customers pay for their meals. The other options do not fit the context as they refer to the characteristics of the pizza rather than the location where it is obtained.
The phone book is a directory that lists contact information for businesses and individuals, including hotels and motels. Therefore, if someone is looking for a place to stay, they would use the phone book to search for hotels or motels in the area. The other options (Mexico, town, city, sun dial) do not provide any assistance in finding lodging accommodations.
The sentence states that the person is looking for a connection for their laptop, which suggests they want to access the internet or share files with other devices. Connecting to a computer network is a common way to do this, which is why it's the correct answer. The other options do not relate to connecting a laptop to the internet or other devices.
The sentence implies that the child was unaware of his mother's struggles, but still had something to offer her. The most likely option is love, as it is a common expression of affection and support towards family members. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that in order to see new films, a person must take a specific action. The phrase "go to movies" is the only option that directly refers to this action, while the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Open eyes" is too general and could apply to any activity, while "kick ball" and "make art" have no relevance to watching new films. "Look for" is also too vague and does not provide enough information about what specifically a person should be looking for.
The sentence implies that contemplating alone for a long time can lead to a certain outcome. The context suggests that this outcome is positive or at least productive. Daydreaming and becoming distracted are both possibilities that might come with contemplation, but they are not the most likely outcome in this context. A headache and sleep are not outcomes that are commonly associated with contemplation, and they do not make sense in this sentence. Getting ideas, on the other hand, is a common outcome of contemplation, especially if the contemplation is focused and deliberate.
The sentence suggests that the pioneer went to the general store to purchase something that is used for storage. Checkers and buffalo are not related to storage, while baking soda is not typically stored in barrels. Salt can sometimes be stored in barrels, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Barrels, on the other hand, are commonly used for storage purposes, especially in pioneer times when they were used to store food, drink, and other supplies. Therefore, the correct answer is barrels.
The sentence mentions "walking and swinging around in grass" which is a common activity in golf. The mention of "expensive equipment" also suggests that the activity is a sport or recreational activity that requires specialized gear. The other options do not match the context of the sentence.
Newspapers are commonly used to announce events or news to a wider audience. In this case, the sentence suggests that the newspaper is being used to announce an engagement. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the act of making a public announcement through a newspaper.
The sentence implies that John needed a straight wire, but the wire has become something else due to damage or use. The words "abuse" and "endured" suggest that the wire has undergone some sort of force or stress that has caused it to no longer be straight. The words "crooked" and "curved" both suggest that the wire is not straight, but "bent" is the most appropriate choice as it directly implies the wire was once straight but is now bowed due to external factors. The other options do not match the description in the sentence.
The sentence implies that metal is extracted from a natural resource that is found underground. The term "ore" refers to mineral deposits that contain valuable metals, such as iron, gold, and silver. Extracting metal from ore is a process that involves crushing and smelting the ore, which separates the metal from the other elements in the ore. The other options do not accurately describe the source of metal or the process by which it is obtained.
The question is asking where you would store a bucket when it is not in use, which suggests that it is a household item that needs to be easily accessible. It also uses the word "property", which implies that it is not being used outside in a specific location. Out of the choices provided, the most likely place to store a household item like a bucket would be in a utility closet. The other options are either outdoor locations or specific structures that may not be available for all households.
The question asks about what someone does to relax at night, suggesting that the answer should be an activity that promotes sleep and relaxation. "Go to bed" is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to the context of the question. "Find time" may suggest a general approach to time management, but it does not explain what the person does to relax. "Check mail" and "listen to music" may be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily promote sleep. "Stop worrying" may be a valuable suggestion for relaxation, but it is not an activity that the person does.
The options "office building," "office supply store," and "with Dwight" do not seem relevant to the context of the question, which is about finding a specific object. "Desktop" is a possibility, but the phrasing of the question ("where might it be") implies that the stapler is misplaced or not in its usual location. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the stapler could be in a desk drawer, which is a common place to store office supplies.
The sentence mentions that many homes in a particular country are built around a courtyard, suggesting that this is a common architectural feature in that country. The option "Spain" stands out as a possible answer, as traditional Spanish homes are often built around a central courtyard known as a "patio." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some are even inappropriate or offensive.
The sentence suggests that Sean is in a state where he is unable to do something related to his love of building houses. "Construct" is the most specific term related to building houses, as it refers directly to the act of creating something. The other options are more general or vague and do not necessarily relate to building houses specifically.
The sentence suggests that pretending to be a police officer involves some form of deception or pretending to be something you're not. Fighting, misunderstanding, play, and distrust are not directly connected to the act of pretending to be a police officer.
A writing instrument is typically used for writing and is often considered as a tool to make a statement. Fine crafted writing instruments are usually sold in specialized stores that cater to professional writers, artists, calligraphers, etc. This type of store is known as a stationery store. The other choices in the answer list have no clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence indicates that the detective is gathering information from witnesses, suggesting that they are trying to obtain some type of information or knowledge. The most likely reason for a detective to gather information from witnesses is to help solve a crime or piece together an investigation. The other options, such as fun, happiness, and power, do not make sense in the context of investigating a crime and obtaining information from witnesses. The option "ulcers" is not a valid reason for the detective's actions.
The sentence suggests that Joe keeps his tools in a place where spiders have been found. The most likely option for this is a toolbox, as it is a common storage solution for tools and can easily attract spiders if left untouched for a long period of time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person was on a fan boat in a nature area known for swamps and alligators. A bald eagle sighting is unexpected in this scenario and suggests that the person may have been in a location where bald eagles are known to live. The Everglades in Florida is a well-known nature area that is home to both alligators and bald eagles, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Supermarkets are typically found in areas with a higher population density, such as cities and towns, where there is a greater demand for groceries and supplies. Strip malls may also contain supermarkets, but they are usually located in commercial areas rather than residential ones. Vermont is also not a likely answer, as it is a specific location and not a general category of where one might find a supermarket. The phrase "buy food for family" and "get supplies" may suggest a need for a supermarket, but they are not specific enough to be the correct answer.
A lantern is a portable source of light that is typically used in situations where there is no access to electricity or other sources of light. The options "grocery store," "antique shop," and "house" all have access to electricity, and therefore would not require a lantern. "Street" might require a lantern in certain situations, but the most specific and accurate answer is "dark place," as this covers a broad range of scenarios where a lantern would be necessary, such as camping, hiking, or exploring caves.
"Beat" is a term commonly used to refer to the specific area or neighborhood that a police officer is assigned to patrol. This term is commonly used in police jargon and is often heard in police dramas and movies. The other options, such as "direct traffic" or "park," do not necessarily pertain to the specific area that a police officer is responsible for.
The sentence implies that the woman acted in self-defense, which suggests that she may have been threatened or attacked in some way. The option "being raped" is the most likely reason for the woman to have taken such an extreme action. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for murder in this scenario.
The sentence suggests that the baby was refusing to do something related to eating breakfast, which is likely opening its mouth to receive food. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence or provide an unlikely explanation for the baby's crankiness (crying or refusing to get out of bed). The option "buy food" is also unlikely as it is unlikely that a baby would be responsible for purchasing its own food.
The word "made up" suggests that the answer is referring to a group of people. The options "buildings," "apartment," and "falling down" are not made up of people, but physical structures or events. While a classroom contains people, it can also refer to an empty room, and the context of the sentence does not specify that it is referring to a room filled with people. "Audience" fits the criteria of being made up of people, as it is a group of individuals gathered together to watch a performance or event.
The sentence suggests that the person was suffering from a serious illness (a cold) and was afraid that they might die. In such a situation, seeking help from a medical professional would be the most logical course of action, as they would be able to provide the necessary treatment and care to help the person recover. The other options (ocean, write will, never want, were shot) do not make sense in the given context.
The question suggests that the person is in a location where they may have access to a desk drawer, such as an office or a classroom. A desk drawer is a common place to store pens and other office supplies, making it a likely choice for finding a pen. The other options do not provide a clear solution to the problem of not having a pen.
Panting is a common way for dogs to regulate their body temperature, especially when they are hot. When a dog pants, it is able to exchange heat from its body with the cooler air outside its body, which helps to cool it down. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the little boy was asked why he did something, and he responded that he didn't know and it was just something. The word "because" is often used to explain why something was done, so it is likely that the little boy's response was "because." The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence.
A horizontal surface typically refers to a flat surface that is parallel to the ground, such as a table or desk. It is common to display pictures on a flat surface in a room, such as a desktop or a shelf, especially if the picture is small or if wall space is limited. A picture displayed on a wall would be in a vertical orientation, so this option can be eliminated. A microwave is not a suitable surface for displaying pictures and an art show is an event where pictures are displayed, not a surface to display them.
Riding a bike requires good balance to keep the bike upright and maintain control. While wheels and pedalling are necessary components of a bike, they don't necessarily require a specific skill. Feet are used for pedalling, but balance is more important for riding a bike. Practice is important for improving one's bike riding skills, but it is not a skill in and of itself.
The sentence describes a field of pumps that are used to extract oil from somewhere. The use of the word "ground" in the choices suggests that this is where the oil is being extracted from, which is consistent with common oil drilling practices. The other options, such as "manual" and "restaurant," have no obvious relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a place where vendors bring goods for sale. The term "receiving" is commonly used in retail and other industries to refer to the department or area where incoming goods are processed and stored. The other options do not relate to this context, as they either refer to taking away goods (take away) or keeping them (keep), which is not what a department for receiving goods would do. "Delivered" and "pick up" are also not correct as they do not describe the department or area where goods are received.
The sentence suggests that being in a certain location within a ticket office is undesirable, and the phrase "end of line" means the furthest point in the queue, where you have to wait the longest. This implies that waiting in a line for a long time is seen as undesirable in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that exercise is beneficial for overall health, and that doing something specific after exercise will aid in a faster recovery. Stretching is a common post-workout activity that helps to reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility, making it a logical choice for the correct answer. The other options, such as lowering cholesterol or tracking progress, do not specifically relate to post-workout recovery.
The sentence suggests that you forgot something at home after you have already left to go somewhere. In such a situation, the most logical choice would be to go back home and retrieve the forgotten item. The other options do not provide any solution to the problem of forgetting something at home.
Wind instruments are commonly sold at music stores, which are specifically designed to cater to musicians and carry a wide range of instruments for sale. Band practice, concert, symphony, and music room are not likely places to purchase a wind instrument for personal use as they are primarily associated with group performances or practice spaces.
Lighting alcohol on fire is a common experiment in chemistry labs to study combustion reactions. It is not a typical activity in a supermarket, bar, pub, or restaurant, which are commercial establishments that primarily serve food and drinks to customers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be a place where scientific experiments are conducted, such as a chemistry lab.
A panoramic view refers to a view that extends over a wide area in all directions. This type of view is typically seen from a high vantage point, such as the top floor of a tall building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that lettuce is being transported in bulk and sold at a particular location. A supermarket is the most likely option as it is a large retailer that sells a wide range of products, including fresh produce that is often transported in large trucks. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not involve the transportation of lettuce or are not a likely location for bulk produce sales.
Social security payments are typically given to individuals who have retired and are no longer able to work. The sentence suggests that people who are dying receive these payments, which implies that they are no longer able to work due to their condition. The other options do not make sense in this context - rejuvenation and born again are religious concepts, no longer exist is too final and does not explain why they would receive payments, and change of color has no connection to the topic of social security payments.
A jumping rope is typically used for a type of exercise called jump rope, where the user jumps over the rope as it passes under their feet. The word "hopping" is the most closely related to the physical action of jumping during jump rope exercise. The other choices are more closely associated with the physical effects of exercise, such as fatigue, sweating, and tiredness.
The sentence references the fall season and fields, which suggests that the geese may be participating in a migration. Geese are known for their annual migrations, where they fly long distances from their breeding grounds to warmer climates in the fall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker entered a space, took their seat, and then the curtains were drawn back to reveal a performance. This is a common experience in a theatre setting where audiences go to watch shows. The options airplane and movie are unlikely because there would not be curtains that draw back in those settings, and the word "enjoyed" suggests that the answer likely refers to a form of entertainment. Auditorium is a more general term and while it may be used in the context of a theatre, it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
The phrase "who doesn't want to fight anymore" suggests a desire for peace in a conflict or disagreement. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to achieving peace. "Explicate" means to explain or analyze, which does not relate to the idea of peace. "Pay tribute to king" is irrelevant to the question. "Wear shoes" and "do well" are also not related to achieving peace. Therefore, the only logical answer is "hope for peace."
Post offices are typically found in the center of town or city, making them easily accessible to as many people as possible. Placing a post office in a building or above ground may be possible, but it is not necessarily the ideal location. Most towns may have a post office, but their location can vary. The business district may be a suitable location, but not necessarily the ideal one since not everyone lives or works in that area. Therefore, the best fit from the choices given is the center of town.
Squirrels are typically found living in trees and wooded areas, which suggests that the correct answer is likely to be a natural setting. While squirrels may occasionally venture into urban areas, it is unlikely that they would make their home on a roof or inside a home. Parks and yards may provide some habitat for squirrels, but they are not typically large enough to support a sustained population. Forests, on the other hand, offer an abundance of trees and other resources that squirrels need to survive.
The sentence suggests that there may be snakes present in a body of water and provides a clue that this body of water is located in Africa. The Amazon River is located in South America, but is known for its large number of snake species, making it the most likely correct answer. The other options, such as tree or western Texas, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the woman in question made dinner for the man to eat, and it was not a common occurrence for her to do so. Therefore, the correct answer would be "cook dinner." The other answer choices do not make logical sense based on the given information.
The question is asking about where tree roots cling, which is typically to the surface of the earth or soil. The other options (yard, orchard, museum, countryside) do not have any clear relevance to the question.
The sentence suggests that the object being referred to is located in the back and has a lot of dust, which is commonly associated with shelves that are not frequently used or cleaned. Closets, doors, and corners may also accumulate dust, but they do not have the same implied placement as "in the back." A library could also have a lot of dust, but the sentence does not imply that the object is part of a larger collection or space.
The sentence suggests that the protagonist felt welcomed and happy to be meeting new people at the comic store. The phrase "making friends" indicates that these people share some common ground or interests, which is further supported by the use of the phrase "it was nice to meet people with". The other options (smiling, smile, open mind, and laughter) do not fully capture the idea of shared interests, and are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the student's loss of balance was related to the nervousness he experienced while trying to explain what neuroepithelium is. The inner ear contains the vestibular system, which is responsible for maintaining balance and spatial orientation. Therefore, the most likely choice is the inner ear. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Confession is an activity that usually involves talking because it is a religious or spiritual practice in which an individual confesses their sins, mistakes, and transgressions to a clergy member or religious leader. Singing, state parks, carnival, and opera do not necessarily involve talking, although singing and opera may involve vocalization.
The sentence implies that an adult is asking questions to a child, which is a common method used by teachers to engage students in learning. Asking questions can help students think critically and reflect on what they have learned, which is the main goal of teaching. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of an adult asking a child questions.
Lactose intolerance means that a person cannot digest lactose, which is a type of sugar found in milk and dairy products. If someone with lactose intolerance eats a dinner made of cheese (which contains lactose), they are likely to experience indigestion, which can cause symptoms such as bloating, gas, nausea, and abdominal pain. The other options are less likely to occur in this context.
The sentence mentions that the teacher was explaining a song to students while playing on an upright piano. It implies that this activity took place in a room specifically designated for music education, which is commonly referred to as a music room. The bathroom, house, living room, and music store are unlikely locations for such an activity to take place, making them incorrect answers.
The question is about a grading system where F means failing and the opposite of failing would be passing. A's are the highest grades one can receive, so if you receive A's, you are passing your classes with flying colors. Therefore, the correct answer is passing. The other options are not related to the context of the question.
Bathing is primarily done for the purpose of maintaining personal hygiene by cleaning the body of dirt and sweat. While wetness and the use of water are necessary components of taking a bath, they are not the main purpose. Exfoliation, while sometimes a secondary benefit of using specific bath products, is not a necessary component of bathing.
The sentence suggests that it was a game where a ball was hit over a boundary, which is a common feature in sports such as cricket or baseball. The term "sporting event" also implies a sense of organized competition or spectatorship, which further supports the idea that it was a game or match rather than another type of activity like "society" or "ranch country". "Basketball" is unlikely to be the correct answer since hitting a ball over a boundary is not a feature of basketball.
The sentence suggests that someone who operates a vehicle while inebriated may face certain consequences. In this case, the term "inebriated" suggests that the person is under the influence of alcohol, which in turn means that they are likely to be accused of "drunk driving." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking where one would acquire jewelry if they do not have any. A department store is a common place to buy jewelry, as they typically have a variety of options at various price points. The other choices may be places where one could store or retrieve jewelry, but they are not where one would go to acquire it.
The sentence implies that a philosopher is engaged in studies with the objective of eventually gaining something. The choices "job," "boredom," "anxiety," and "impatience" do not make sense in this context. "Wisdom" is a commonly associated goal of philosophical study, which would align with the idea that a philosopher is seeking to gain knowledge and understanding through their studies.
The context of the sentence suggests that the activity being referred to is something that young boys do on ice during the winter. Skiing and playing hockey are both common winter sports that are often done on ice, while knitting and warming oneself have no clear connection to the context. "Summer" is also not a viable option as the question specifies the winter season. Therefore, the most likely answer is "play hockey."
The sentence suggests that the woman enjoys shopping for knickknacks at a thrift store, but as a result, her house has a lot of something on every shelf. The word "clutter" is often used to describe a space that is filled with too many objects and lacks organization, which makes it the most fitting choice. "Poverty" is unlikely to be the correct answer because the sentence does not suggest that the woman's spending habits are causing financial difficulties for her. "Getting" and "more happiness" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "satisfaction" is not the most precise word to describe the result of having a lot of objects on every shelf.
The word "intensely" suggests that the speaker was focused and concentrated on the lecture. Therefore, the correct answer is "pay attention," as this is the only option that implies an intense level of focus. The other choices do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate directly to listening to a lecture.
The sentence suggests that the use of a computer is causing some kind of effect on the person. Talking to their granddaughter is a positive experience that would likely cause happiness. The option "ocean" does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "headache" suggests a negative effect, but there is no indication in the sentence that the person is experiencing any physical discomfort. The option "program created" is irrelevant to the sentence. However, the use of technology can often lead to stress, particularly for older adults who may not be as comfortable using computers.
The context suggests that Joe is in a place where many people from different locations are gathering, which is commonly associated with convention centers. Convention centers are designed to hold large events, such as conferences, conventions, and trade shows. Public buildings, person and large buildings are too broad and do not provide any additional information to suggest that Joe is specifically in a convention center. A box is not likely to be a suitable location for a large gathering of people.
The sentence implies that John could not scatter his wife's remains in the wilderness because he needed to delay due to paying debts. This suggests that John may have been struggling financially and was unable to travel to the location where he wanted to scatter his wife's remains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the trash cans are located on sidewalks, which implies that they are likely in a public area with foot traffic. Out of the given options, only parks are typically located alongside sidewalks and have a high volume of visitors, making them a suitable location for trash cans. Hospitals, motels, and offices are typically located on larger properties and do not have as much foot traffic on sidewalks, while corners may have some foot traffic but are not a common location for trash cans.
The sentence implies that the family wanted to adopt a child for reasons related to the environment or ethical concerns. The word "abhor" suggests that they strongly dislike or disapprove of something, which in this case is likely the act of abandoning a child. Therefore, the correct answer is "abandon," as the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
If an airplane's engines cut off and cannot be restarted in flight, the plane will lose its thrust and begin to descend rapidly. Without power, the pilot is unable to control the plane's speed or altitude. This often results in a crash or forced landing. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of losing engine power in flight.
A cavity is a type of dental decay, usually caused by bacteria that produce acid which erodes tooth enamel. Molars are the teeth located towards the back of the mouth, which are used for grinding and chewing food. They have more surface area and deeper grooves, which makes them more prone to developing cavities. The other options in the choices do not relate specifically to teeth or dental health, except for the dentist option, which is more related to preventative care rather than the location of a potential cavity.
The sentence suggests that the print item in question is a source of information about current events. While "question authority," "melt," "act," and "dictionary" do not provide information about current events, newspapers are known for their coverage of news and events happening in the world.
Anemones are aquatic creatures that typically live in the sea, so the correct answer would be related to a water environment. The options "nursery," "desert," and "south pacific" do not have any clear connection to sea life, so they can be eliminated. The remaining options are "sea water" and "Atlantic Ocean." While an anemone could potentially live in the Atlantic Ocean, the more general answer of "sea water" is a better fit since anemones can be found in various bodies of saltwater across the world.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for lodging in a specific location in order to be close to where they need to be. The options ‘yurt’, ‘resort area’, and ‘going on vacation’ do not fit the criteria of being a specific place that the person needs to be in. ‘Michigan’ is a geographic location and not a specific destination, so it also does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, ‘big city’ is the best answer as cities are typically associated with specific places and activities, making it the most likely option for the person to want to be close to where they need to be.
The question is asking for a suggestion for something beautiful to alleviate boredom. Seeing art is a common suggestion for people looking for beauty, as art can be visually stunning and emotionally evocative. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to beauty or may not be feasible options for someone looking for a quick distraction from boredom (e.g. grocery shopping or doing a crossword puzzle). Additionally, seeing a ghost may not be considered beautiful by everyone.
The sentence implies that in order for a projectile ball to hit a target, it needs to be in motion, as it cannot hit anything otherwise. This is a basic principle of physics, as an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. The other options, such as the ocean or a flintlock, have no clear connection to the sentence and do not make sense in this context.
The question is asking for a place to set a cup of coffee, implying that it needs a flat surface. A table is a common surface for placing drinks while relaxing, and it is also mentioned in contrast to the other options (coffee shop, kitchen, hand, office), which would not necessarily have a table or suitable surfaces to place a cup of coffee.
The sentence suggests that the egg was not fully cooked and there was no toast to absorb the runny yolk. This would result in a messy plate that would need to be cleaned after the meal. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not relate to eggs or food waste.
The word "aplomb" means self-confidence or assuredness, particularly in social situations. If someone is behaving with proper aplomb, they are likely exhibiting good manners and social grace. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a behavior that goes against these socially acceptable norms, such as being impolite. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to manners or social behavior.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys playing squash as a form of warm-up before lifting weights. It also implies that the squash court is located within a facility that the person has access to. The term "country club" is commonly associated with private recreational facilities that offer amenities such as squash courts, swimming pools, fitness centers, and other recreational activities. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence, except for "fitness center," which may also have squash courts.
The sentence suggests that the focus is on what happens to animals after they eat food. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body. The other options do not relate to the process of eating and digesting food.
A garden is a common place for growing plants, and it typically involves using a lot of soil or dirt to create a suitable environment for the plants to grow. The other options do not make sense in this context - a corner, street, closet, or bathtub are not typically used for gardening.
The wording of the question suggests that someone is being judged guilty, and the question asks about how that person feels about it. From this, we can infer that the person being judged may feel negatively about the experience. The word "resentment" suggests a feeling of bitterness or indignation towards the one doing the judging, which would be a common reaction to being judged guilty. The other options do not accurately capture the emotions that one might feel in this situation.
The description of a town being located between two mountains suggests that it is situated in a valley, which is the low-lying area between two hills or mountains. A hospital or train station may also be located in a valley, but the sentence specifically mentions two mountains, which indicates a geological feature rather than a man-made structure. The mention of Michigan or any other state seems irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James had to pay a high price for using a toilet, which is unlikely to be the case for a typical public bathroom or one in a regular residence. Motel rooms are often associated with a paid option for a private bathroom, making it the most likely choice for James. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the heavy metal band was performing at a stadium, which is a large venue suitable for concerts. Because heavy metal music typically requires high volume and a lot of energy, it is likely that they needed electricity to power their instruments and amplifiers in order to provide a good performance for the audience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Puzzles and riddles are typically associated with providing an intellectual challenge. They often require the solver to use their problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities to arrive at a solution. Avoiding pain, seeking compliments, or obtaining a passing grade are not motivations commonly associated with completing puzzles or riddles. Attention-seeking may be a motivation for some individuals, but it is not a definitive answer given the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that someone is making breakfast and the context hints at them making toast. To make toast, two slices of bread are typically placed in a toaster, which is an appliance designed to brown bread by heating it with electricity. The other options do not have any clear connection to making toast.
The sentence clearly states that the person is doing housework, which is an activity done to clean and organize a living space. The options "boredom," "Michigan," and "nice home" are not related to the context of the sentence and can be ruled out. The option "feeling satisfied" is a plausible choice, but the most direct and literal answer is "house clean."
The context suggests that a corpse is being referred to, which implies that the question is related to death and funerals. Hospitals are a place where people often pass away and where bodies are kept before being moved to other locations. It is common practice for hospitals to cover bodies with a sheet or blanket out of respect for the deceased, which is why this option is the most likely answer. The other choices have no clear relevance to the context provided.
The sentence suggests that the person in the car was trying to kill the man, and they were in pursuit. The fact that the man was trying to break the glass in order to escape also implies that the car was closing in on him quickly. Therefore, the correct answer is "accelerate," as this option best reflects the action the person in the car would have taken to try and catch the man. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The verb "plopped" suggests that the trucker arrived at a place where he was able to relax, indicating a rest area is a more likely option than a bordello or bus stop. Additionally, a garden or state park may be pleasant locations for relaxation, but a rest area is the most common place for a trucker to take a break on a long drive.
The question is asking for a characteristic or element that is shared between the USA and a republic. The USA is a federal republic, which means that it consists of a central government and individual states that have their own governing powers. Therefore, "state" is the correct answer. "Democratic" is a political term that can describe both republics and other forms of government, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. "Kingdom," "democracy," and "dictatorship" are all forms of government that are different from a republic, making them incorrect choices.
The sentence implies that the person is hiking, which means they are likely traveling on foot and need to carry their belongings with them. The other options (person, hamper, closet, upstairs) suggest stationary locations that are not practical for carrying extra clothing on a hike. A backpack is a common item used for carrying supplies on a hike, making it the logical choice for storing extra clothing.
Apple trees are known for producing flowers, which eventually develop into apples. The word "bloom" specifically refers to the process of the tree producing flowers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the location of the crab is in a very cold area in the east, which implies it is found in the Atlantic Ocean as it is the body of water located to the east of North America. The other options, such as fish market, shallow waters, fresh water, and shore line do not fit this description of a cold area in the east where a crab could be found.
The sentence suggests that the chef is looking to improve his skills, and studying French cooking is often considered one of the best ways to do so. French cuisine is known for its complexity and attention to detail, which requires a lot of training and practice to master. The other options, such as thin potatoes or drinking, do not seem directly related to perfecting the craft of cooking.
The sentence implies that the person only got a puppy instead of a kitten and a puppy because they only wanted one pet. The phrase "one choice for pet" matches the meaning conveyed by the sentence, while the other options do not relate to the context or offer an explanation as to why only a puppy was chosen.
The sentence suggests that Jenny did not have any protection from the sun, which likely means she was exposed to direct sunlight. Options like "full sunlight," "bright sunshine," and "sunny place" can all be used to describe sunny environments, but they do not convey the lack of shade that is being described in this sentence. "Eat cake" is a completely unrelated option.
The sentence suggests that cleaning the house for a long time can lead to a negative physical state. The word "after" implies that something may happen as a result of the activity. The options "neatness," "order," and "sneezing" do not make sense in this context as they are not negative outcomes of cleaning. "Tiredness" is a possibility, but "exhaustion" implies a more extreme level of fatigue and is a better answer option.
The sentence suggests that someone is organizing when to go to a party, which is an act of planning. The other options do not relate to the idea of organizing or scheduling an event. "Rumpspringa" refers to a period of adolescence in some Amish communities, "meeting new people" and "having fun" are not specific enough to describe the action of scheduling, and "meet new people" is not a grammatically correct phrase on its own.
Comets are celestial objects that orbit around the sun. Unlike planets, which have relatively circular orbits, comets tend to have highly elliptical orbits. These orbits are often described as "set orbits" because they are determined by the gravitational forces of the sun and other objects in the solar system. Comets are composed of an icy nucleus and a trail of gas and dust, which is why "ice" is also a plausible answer. However, the question specifically asks about the path of comets, not their composition. "Universe" and "space" are both too vague to be correct answers, and "solid nucleus" is incorrect because it only describes one part of a comet, not its path.
The sentence implies that after having sex, people may feel dirty and need to shower. This is a common experience as sex involves physical touching and sweating, which can leave one feeling unclean. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the tumors found by the vet were malignant, which means they are cancerous. Cancer is a serious disease that can spread to other parts of the body, causing pain and discomfort for the affected animal. As a result, the likely fate of the animals in question is that they will unfortunately succumb to the cancer and die. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the seriousness of the situation.
issing is commonly associated with romantic and sexual intimacy. The option "sexual stimulation" is the most logical answer since it refers to the physical arousal and excitement that can result from kissing. The other options, such as herpes, headache, and catching a cold, are negative associations that are not directly related to the act of kissing. "Happiness" could also be a possible answer, but it is less specific to the physical sensation described in the question.
The sentence suggests that Billy got rid of the newspaper once he arrived at his destination. The most common place to dispose of a newspaper is in the trash, making "trash" the most likely answer. "Floor," "subway," "ground," and "lawn" are all unlikely options as they suggest that Billy left the newspaper in a public place rather than disposing of it properly.
A pail is a type of container usually used for carrying water or other liquids. It is often kept in a utility room, which is a space in a house where all the necessary household items are stored, such as cleaning supplies, tools, and other equipment. The other options are not typically associated with storing household items like pails.
The sentence suggests that the item is printed with ink and distributed daily. Fountain pens and printers are tools used for printing or writing, but they do not necessarily produce something that is distributed daily. Squid is a sea animal that has nothing to do with printing. Books may be printed with ink, but they are not necessarily distributed daily, whereas newspapers are. Therefore, the correct answer is newspaper.
The phrase "unexpected decent outcome" suggests that something positive and unexpected has happened. In many cultures, it is common for people to express gratitude or give thanks when something positive happens. The phrase "kill each other" and "hatred" have negative connotations and would not be appropriate in response to a positive outcome. "Experience pain" is also unlikely to be a common response to an unexpected decent outcome. "Talk to each other" is a general response that could be appropriate in a variety of situations, but it doesn't specifically address the idea of a positive outcome.
anji is a form of writing that originated in Japan and is still used today. Therefore, the presence of Kanji on the terrace strongly suggests that it was made in Japan. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the company sends off purchases to customers and that they use recycled cardboard for something related to the purchases. The most logical option based on this context is "packaging materials," as recycled cardboard is often used for packaging products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "liar" is often used to describe someone who intentionally provides false information or deceives others. While the other options may be potential reasons for someone to act in a negative manner, they do not necessarily explain why someone would be labeled as a liar specifically. Therefore, "false information" is the most relevant choice based on the given question.
The sentence suggests that the child was rewarded for waiting politely for dessert, which implies that the child demonstrated patience. Patience refers to the ability to wait calmly and without complaint, which would be the appropriate behavior in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence; spending time, getting bored, and anger are not positive behaviors that would be rewarded, and timing does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the man was providing financial assistance to the pan handler. The phrase "out of pocket" is often used to describe expenses that are paid with personal funds rather than from a business or organization. The other options do not make sense in the context of helping a pan handler in the streets.
The word "caretakers" suggests that the answer is someone responsible for taking care of a child. "Principal" refers to the head of a school, "birth" refers to the process of giving birth, "loving couple" could refer to any two people in a romantic relationship, and "act of sex" is not a term used to describe those responsible for taking care of a child. "Parents" is the only option that specifically refers to those who have responsibility for the care and upbringing of a child.
The sentence suggests that the niece is not seen often, which indicates that the occasion would be a larger family gathering. A family reunion would be the most likely option for such an event, where extended family members come together after long periods of time. The other options, such as a brother's house or party, do not necessarily guarantee the presence of extended family members. Meanwhile, a family picture book and family tree are not physical places where one can run into someone.
The sentence suggests that the task was difficult and required a lot of effort. The word "taxing" implies that it was physically or mentally demanding. The word "elaborate" suggests that the task was complex and required a high level of skill or attention to detail. The answer option "energy" best fits the context of the sentence since it describes the resources needed to complete a demanding task. The other answer options do not relate directly to the context of the sentence.
This question is related to the common symptoms associated with a hangover after drinking heavily. Headaches are a common symptom, often caused by dehydration or changes in blood flow to the brain. Discomfort could be a general term that could apply to a range of physical discomforts associated with a hangover, but headache is a more specific and common symptom. Shock and get up do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The keyword in the question is "ribbon," which is a component of a typewriter. A typewriter uses a ribbon to imprint ink on paper and create written words. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Sheep are domesticated animals that are commonly raised on farms for their wool, meat, and milk. They are often grazed in meadows or pastures, where there is plenty of grass and other vegetation for them to eat. Therefore, meadow and farm are the most likely answers. School, lamb, and fairgrounds do not have any clear connection to the habitat or behavior of sheep.
The sentence refers to a situation where someone is watching TV on the couch, which is most likely to occur in a living room. The sentence also mentions that the air is stuffy, which suggests that it is hot and uncomfortable. Therefore, turning a fan on would help to circulate the air and make the living room more comfortable. The other options, such as a hockey game, a football stadium, a bathroom, or a hot room, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the student needed to easily access their writing instrument while walking, which implies that it needed to be stored in a portable location. The options "desk drawer," "cabinet," and "classroom" are stationary locations and do not make sense in the context of walking. "Purse" is a possibility, but the sentence does not mention anything about the student carrying a purse. Therefore, the most likely place for the student to store their writing instrument would be in their pocket.
An auditorium is a type of building that is designed to accommodate large groups of people for a variety of events, including plays, concerts, and lectures. However, the specific context of the question suggests that the answer should refer to a group of people who are watching a play. The term "crowd" is commonly used to describe a large group of people who are gathered together for a common purpose, such as watching a play in an auditorium. The other options are either too general or too specific and do not fit the context of the question.
Committing murder is a serious criminal offense and could result in a range of legal consequences. Incarceration, trial, imprisonment, and prosecution are all possible outcomes, but imprisonment specifically refers to the act of being sent to prison or serving time behind bars. The other options may be related to the consequences of the crime, but do not specifically refer to the punishment that may be given for committing murder.
The word "obtain" suggests that the person is looking to purchase new soap, rather than finding it in their own home. A "supermarket" is a common place to buy household items such as soap, whereas "washing," "cabinet," "own home," and "sink" do not make sense as answers to the question.
The question is asking about what people do for food, which suggests that the correct answer would involve obtaining or preparing food. Of the options provided, only "kill animals" directly relates to obtaining food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The context clues in the sentence suggest that the bottles being referred to are likely alcoholic beverages, as they are located behind a cashier. This would be commonly found in a liquor store, which specializes in selling alcohol. The other options do not make as much sense or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (e.g. a diaper bag or medicine cabinet would not typically have bottles of alcohol).
The sentence suggests that the person or people had to consult a source to know where to go before getting on the national highway. An atlas is a collection of maps that can help with navigation and finding locations, making it a likely choice for consulting. The other options either don't have a clear connection to the context, like Canada and United States, or are too general, like major cities and book.
The sentence suggests that professors are involved in imparting knowledge to students, which is commonly associated with teaching courses. While it is possible for professors to be experts in physics, stating facts, or schooling students, these options are not the primary focus of their job. The image of professors wearing wrinkled tweed jackets may be a cultural stereotype but not relevant to their job duties.
The context of the question suggests a specific type of activity involving a ball and pins, which is most commonly associated with bowling. The other options do not involve pins, or the specific type of activity described in the question. A football stadium and soccer field are primarily used for sports that involve kicking a ball, while a sporting event and sporting goods store are too general and do not fit the specific activity described.
The question asks about something needed for cleaning, and one of the options is "using water." This is a likely correct answer because water is commonly used as a cleaning agent for many different surfaces and materials. The other options, such as "sing a song" or "neatness," do not seem related to cleaning. "Allergies" and "healthy living" might be tangentially related to cleaning (e.g. using hypoallergenic cleaning products), but neither is as directly relevant as using water.
The sentence implies that the person is spitting excessively without realizing it, which suggests that there may be a problem with their saliva production or the condition of their mouth. Phlegm and spittle are related to the act of coughing or clearing the throat, while disease and germs are vague and do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the student needs to obtain some supplies that are not already available at home. The most logical place to acquire these items would be a store where school supplies are sold. The other options (classroom, parking garage, backpack, cabinet) do not make sense in the context of acquiring new supplies.
The sentence suggests that Sally is waiting in a line that is moving very slowly, which can be a frustrating experience. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Delays" is too general and doesn't reflect how Sally is feeling, while "being annoyed" is too similar to frustration to be a distinct option. "Moving forward" and "progress" are both more positive options that don't reflect Sally's potential negative feelings about the slow-moving queue.
The word "accomplish" suggests that the animal is trying to achieve a goal or complete an action. Among the given options, "eating" is the most likely choice as it is a necessary behavior for many animals to survive and fulfill their biological needs. The other options do not seem to fit the context of an animal's behavior.
The sentence suggests that James and Holly were dancing together, and that James pressed himself against Holly in a certain way while they danced. The most logical option for what James pressed against Holly would be "rhythmic movement," as this is a common physical sensation experienced while dancing. The other options, such as euphoria or happiness, are not physical sensations that can be pressed against someone, while fatigue would not be associated with dancing.
The context of the sentence suggests that the house in question has a subscription to a service that delivers something to their driveway every morning. The only choice that fits this context is "newspaper," as many people receive a daily newspaper subscription that is delivered to their driveway. The other options (subdivision, street, laundry mat, surface of earth) do not fit the context of the sentence and do not have any clear connection to a daily driveway delivery.
The question is asking about a person's response to feeling dirty. Washing oneself is a common and logical action to take to clean one's body when feeling dirty. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence mentions a weight cut, which is a common practice for athletes who participate in weight-classed sports such as wrestling, MMA, and boxing. The mention of energy levels also suggests that the person in question is an athlete, as energy is a critical factor in sports performance. The option "play sports" is the most appropriate answer because it directly relates to the context of the sentence, while the other options do not.
Eating healthy and regularly is a well-known way to stay healthy, as our bodies need nutrients to function properly. Fever, headache, and excitement are not actions that promote health, and expressive is not a relevant action in this context.
The word "guard" implies that someone or something is being protected or watched over. In this case, the most likely candidate for being guarded would be a prisoner, as prisons rely heavily on the presence of guards to keep inmates secure. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Man post" and "unprotected" imply a lack of protection or defense, which would not require a guard. "Attack" and "intimidation" suggest a more aggressive role than simply guarding, which does not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person has difficulty expressing themselves when they are anxious or excited, which is a common symptom of stuttering. Stuttering is a speech disorder that affects the flow and rhythm of speech, often causing repetition or prolonged sounds or syllables. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A letter opener is typically used to open letters and packages, so it would be kept close at hand for convenience. The most logical place to keep a letter opener would be on a desk, where it can be easily accessed when needed. The other options do not provide a suitable location for storing a letter opener. An office supply store or stationery store would sell letter openers but keeping it there would not be practical. A martyr's chest refers to a medieval chest used to store relics or artifacts and a refrigerator is not a suitable place for storing a letter opener.
The sentence suggests that Danny needed a place to stay in town and the only available option was expensive and had a mismatch between the carpet and drapes. This description is commonly associated with hotels, as they are known for having various styles and decor options in their rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about how people can improve or transform their lives, which strongly suggests that the correct answer will be a positive action that individuals can take. "Better themselves" fits this description, as it implies that people can work to become better versions of themselves through self-improvement, education, personal growth, or other means. The other options are less relevant or appropriate: facing problems and becoming disillusioned are negative experiences that may not lead to positive change, paying bills is a necessary but mundane task, and eating chicken is not related to life transformation.
The sentence suggests that shelter is necessary for survival, and the options presented refer to different possible locations where humans might find shelter. "Homes" is the most likely answer, as it's the most common and typical location for people to find shelter. "Underpass" could potentially be a location for homeless individuals, but it's not a typical answer for where people find shelter. "Workplace" and "school" are places people often go during the day, but they are not typically used as long-term shelters. "Space shuttle" is an unlikely answer as it only applies to astronauts and is not a typical location for shelter.
The sentence suggests that someone had a bad experience during a flight and may be offered something to make up for it. "First class" is a type of seating class that is associated with luxury and comfort. It is possible that an airline may offer a complimentary first-class ticket as a way to apologize for a bad experience during a previous flight. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that nature can have both positive and negative effects on a person who walks in it. Seeing a bear is potentially dangerous and frightening, while seeing beautiful views can be enjoyable and awe-inspiring. Getting wet can be uncomfortable, especially if the person is not prepared with proper clothing or gear. Getting lost can be stressful and possibly dangerous, as the person may not be able to find their way back to civilization. The last option, "murdered by a landshark," is not a realistic or plausible outcome in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jim believes exercise is the best way to lose weight, possibly because it helps control his appetite. The phrase "you can't get rid of" implies that the thing being referenced is an inherent part of the weight loss process. Fitness and sweating may help with weight loss, but they are not directly related to appetite control. Fast food and thirst are also unrelated to the sentence's context.
The sentence implies that nature's structures are more beautiful than some other types of structures. The word "artificial" means something that is made by humans, as opposed to natural. Therefore, it is the most logical choice as a contrast to nature's structures. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not contrast with nature's structures.
The sentence suggests that water in clouds transforms into something else when it gets cold. The most common transformation that occurs when water is exposed to cold temperatures is that it freezes and becomes snow. Typhoons are large, tropical storms that form in warm waters, so they are not related to the cold temperatures mentioned in the question. Laddle is a tool used for scooping liquids or substances, so it does not relate to the context of the sentence. Teardrops are related to emotions and crying, so they are not related to the scientific process of water freezing. Sink is an object that goes underwater, so it is not related to the context of the sentence either.
The term "swamps" is commonly associated with Louisiana, which is located in the southern United States. Louisiana is known for its wetlands, which include numerous swamps and marshes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about what happens to the body when going to sleep. While snoring and dreaming may occur during sleep, they are not indicative of what happens to the body as a whole. Latency refers to the time it takes to fall asleep and is not a physical change in the body. Dreaming is a separate process from the initial act of falling asleep. Relaxation, on the other hand, is a common physiological change that occurs as the body prepares to rest. This includes a drop in heart rate, breathing rate, and muscle tension, as well as a decrease in brain activity.
Monkeys are known to be arboreal (tree-dwelling) animals and are also known to eat bananas. Therefore, it is logical to assume that a monkey would enjoy being in a place where they can climb and find bananas, such as a banana tree. The other options do not have any clear connection to the natural habitat or dietary preferences of monkeys.
The question is asking for a form of anaerobic exercise, which refers to high intensity, short duration activities that require the body to use energy without oxygen. Lifting weights is a common form of anaerobic exercise because it involves using a high amount of force for a short period of time, which requires the body to break down glucose without oxygen. The other options do not relate to anaerobic exercise and do not require the use of energy without oxygen.
The sentence suggests that the earth is part of something else, and the options "tree", "fotograph", and "dreams" do not make sense in this context. "Orbit" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and does not provide enough information. However, the term "solar system" refers to the sun and all the objects that are bound to it by gravity, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Therefore, "solar system" is the correct answer.
A container can is typically used to store dry goods such as pasta, beans, or cereal. These types of foods are often kept in the pantry, which is a room or cupboard used for storing food and other household items. The other options - store, gas, liquid, and garage - do not make sense as places to put a container can.
The question specifies that the best friend has been known since Kindergarten. This suggests that the meeting place would have been a location that they both regularly attended during their early years, which is most likely to be their primary school. The other options listed do not have any clear connections to a meeting place for friends who have known each other since Kindergarten.
The sentence mentions that James watched the balloon rise, which suggests that he was looking in the direction of the balloon. The word "upwards" specifically refers to a direction that is higher or above, which is the direction that the balloon would be moving in as it rose. The other options do not relate to a direction that is higher or above.
The sentence suggests that John and Tim enjoy playing, which implies that it brings them joy and happiness. The phrase "feeling happy" specifically relates to emotions, which is an appropriate response to the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context. "Learning" does not match the sentence structure, "injury" and "burn" are negative outcomes that would not make John and Tim happy, and "get hungry" is unrelated to the topic of playing.
The context of a birthday party and the mention of "new presents" suggest that the emotion being described is likely positive, rather than negative. Envy and jealousy involve negative feelings towards others, and fear wouldn't typically be associated with seeing presents at a party. Education also doesn't fit the context. Excitement, on the other hand, is a natural response to receiving or seeing new presents at a celebration, making it the most appropriate answer choice.
The sentence describes Joe's reaction to his cat jumping into something, causing him to panic and fear for its life. The mention of the word "delicious" suggests that the cat smelled food, and the unusual level of panic indicates that the cat jumped into a dangerous place. The option "microwave" is the only one that fits the criteria of both being a place where food can be heated and a potential danger to a cat, as being inside a running microwave can be fatal to animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies a contrast between the unpleasant smell of dirty gym socks and the pleasant smell of flowers. The option "smell good" directly addresses this contrast and provides a logical reason for why someone would put flowers in a room with dirty gym socks. The other options do not adequately address the contrast in the question.
The sentence clearly states that the table was not level and that some parts were higher and some were lower with no rhyme or reason. The word "uneven" specifically describes this situation, making it the correct choice. "Build evenly" suggests that the table was intentionally made that way, which is not the case in this sentence. "Unbalanced" and "tilted" could be correct in other contexts, but do not fully capture the idea expressed here. "Electrical circuit" does not relate to the context of the sentence at all.
Home insurance is a form of protection for homeowners against unexpected damages or losses to their property. The person who signs up for home insurance is seeking financial security in case their house or belongings are damaged or destroyed. The other options (live well, good relationship, compliments, discounted furniture) are not related to the purpose of home insurance.
The sentence suggests that James knew that murder was wrong, but still considered doing it because he thought he could get away with it. This implies that he was aware of the legal consequences of murder and the possibility of being prosecuted for it. Therefore, he was fearful and troubled by the prospect of facing prosecution for his actions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a neurological disorder found in cattle that can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated beef products. Symptoms of the disease can take years or even decades to appear, but it can ultimately result in death. The other options do not relate to the potential health risks associated with eating hamburger.
The sentence suggests that using a boat without requiring navigation skills is possible in a specific location. Water, ocean, harbor, and river are all bodies of water that would require navigation skills to operate a boat safely. A garage, on the other hand, is not a body of water and therefore would not require navigation skills to operate a boat.
The phrase "self assured" suggests that the person has confidence and belief in themselves, which is often associated with trusting one's own abilities and decisions. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the phrase. "Acknowledgment" and "feel important" are unrelated to the personal qualities of a self assured person, while "focused" and "know what time" are too specific and do not capture the broader characteristic being described.
The sentence is suggesting that the person being described had no trouble making friends and did not find it to be a difficult or challenging experience. The use of the word "personal" implies that it is something that is typically associated with individual feelings or emotions. Therefore, the only option that makes sense in this context is "conflict," as it suggests that the individual did not have any personal conflicts or issues when it came to making friends. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the emotions that one experiences when giving assistance to the needy. The answer is subjective, but the word "feel" suggests an emotional response rather than a logical or physical one. The choices all offer emotions that are commonly associated with helping others, but "satisfaction" is the most appropriate answer as it describes a feeling of fulfillment or accomplishment that comes from helping others in need. The other options, such as "boredom" or "happiness," do not fit with the context of helping the needy.
The sentence suggests that Paul already has the carrots he wants, and he doesn't have to go anywhere to get them. This indicates that the carrots are likely already in his possession, and the most logical place for them to be is in his refrigerator. The other options, such as the store or farmer's market, suggest that Paul would need to go somewhere to acquire the carrots. The dryer option is clearly an absurd and incorrect choice as it is used for drying clothes, not storing vegetables.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is messy while eating, implying that they leave crumbs or spills behind. The most likely place for this to happen is on a table where food is being consumed. The other options do not make sense in this context, as sailboats, desks, closets, and apartments are not typically associated with eating or messiness.
The sentence is asking about something that every person wants, which indicates it is something universally desired. Life partner is a common desire for many people as human beings are social animals and crave companionship. Money is also a common desire as it provides financial security and the ability to afford basic necessities and luxuries. Larger house and second chances are subjective desires that not everyone may want or need. Headache is not a desire but rather an unwanted physical condition.
The sentence suggests that the flying animal is picking up a string, which is a common material used by birds to build their nests. Birds use a variety of materials, including twigs, grass, and string, to construct their nests and raise their young. Therefore, it is likely that the small flying animal is taking the string to its nest. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person committing perjury is confident that they will get away with it. Confidence is a common trait associated with people who knowingly deceive others or break the law without fear of punishment. The other options either suggest a lack of confidence (such as "go to jail" or "telling lies") or have no clear connection to the context of the sentence ("manual").
The context of the question suggests that the answer should be a location where a tennis court might be found. While it's possible to have a tennis court in a park or a recreational center, an athletic club is more likely to have a tennis court as part of their facilities. A college campus might have a tennis court as well, but it's not as common as an athletic club. The option "desert" doesn't make sense in this context.
The question is asking for an object that can be used to fill a cup and then drink from it. Sand box, kitchen cabinet, and table do not have any mechanism for providing water. A waterfall may be too strong to fill a cup and may not be safe for consumption. A water fountain, on the other hand, is specifically designed to provide clean water for drinking and can be easily used to fill a cup.
The sentence suggests that the two people played video games all night in a living room, which may indicate that they were in someone else's home. The word "visited" implies that the subject enjoyed going somewhere, and the context of the sentence suggests that the person's enjoyment was related to the activity they were doing, which was playing video games. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the weasel has scurried up to a high place to avoid danger, and that someone made a joke connecting the situation to the first president. The most likely connection is the apocryphal story about George Washington chopping down a cherry tree and then telling the truth about it, in which he is said to have climbed a ladder to reach the tree. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the blowfish is an aquatic animal, which means it would only be found in water. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A fish market might sell blowfish, but the sentence is not referring to buying one. The jungle is a land-based environment and is unlikely to have an aquatic animal like a blowfish. Sea water is a possibility, but it is too broad of a term without more context, whereas body of water is more specific and implies a lake, river, or ocean. Soup is not a location and does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the rotor of the Apache helicopter is not powered by internal combustion, indicating that another power source is being used. The options "jet engine" and "electrical circuit" do not seem to make sense in the context of a helicopter rotor. "Rotator" is not a known power source and is not commonly used to refer to a type of engine. Therefore, the most logical option is "electric motor."
In poker, the dealer spreads the community cards (including the flop) face up on the table in the center of the players, so that everyone at the table can see them. Therefore, the answer must be “table”. The other options (players, play games, casino, toy store) do not fit the context of the sentence.
Salt shakers are typically found on table settings during meals, as they are used to add salt to food. The other options may be places where salt shakers are stored, but they are not commonly found in those locations during meal times. A cruet is a container for oil or vinegar, a kitchen cupboard or cabinet is used for storage, and a store is a place of purchase.
The sentence implies that the person wants to use the dollar to purchase something immediately, which suggests that they need to have the dollar readily accessible. The most common place for people to store money that they plan on using in the short term is their pocket. The other options, such as a cash drawer or safety deposit box, are not practical for immediate use, and a piggy bank is typically used for saving money, rather than spending it. While a bank may be a valid option for obtaining cash to use later, the question specifically asks where to put the dollar, rather than where to obtain additional funds.
A sideboard is a piece of furniture often found in dining rooms that is used to store dishes, serving utensils, and other items used during meals. The question specifically mentions a counter, which suggests that the sideboard is being used for serving food buffet-style. The other options, such as the kitchen or living room, do not typically have sideboards.
The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is a vehicle that moves high above the ground or water, since bugs are unable to reach it. An airplane fits this description, as it typically flies at high altitudes. The other options either move closer to the ground or have a structure (such as a windshield) that would allow bugs to reach them.
The sentence suggests that the store in question sells jeans for a decent price. The term "mall store" narrows down the options to stores that are typically found in shopping malls. The option "clothing store" is too general, as most mall stores sell clothing. The options "bedroom" and "apartment" are not stores at all. The option "thrift store" may sell inexpensive clothing, but it is less likely to carry new jeans from popular brands. The option "Gap" is a well-known clothing store that specializes in jeans and is often found in malls, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence implies that the location where a bath towel can be borrowed is a place where people may need to use one temporarily. One possible place where this could occur is at a hotel, where guests often need to borrow towels for use in their rooms or at the pool. The other options, like cupboard or clothes line, are less likely to offer loaner towels.
The word "disillusioned" suggests a sense of disappointment or loss of hope, which could explain why someone might stop caring about their own problems. If they have faced numerous challenges and setbacks without seeing any improvement, they may become disheartened and lose motivation to keep trying. The other options do not necessarily imply a loss of interest in one's own problems.
The sentence suggests that John was riding on a flat, open area until he reached the ocean. A sandplain is a flat or gently sloping area covered in sand, which would fit the description provided in the sentence. The other options, such as a mountain, fancy, cliff, or gorge, all describe features that have significant elevation changes, which would make it unlikely that John could ride a plain over them all the way to the ocean.
The sentence states that the individuals in question were not going to be "big actors," suggesting that they were likely involved in a smaller, more local theater scene. The word "passion" also implies a strong emotional connection to the activity, further reinforcing the idea that they were involved in something they loved. The other options, such as opera, television or blockbuster feature, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
Folding chairs are commonly used in outdoor settings where seating options are limited, such as at beaches, parks, or outdoor events. However, they are not typically stored in these locations, as they are often rented or brought specifically for the occasion. The other options, such as city hall, closet, garage, or school, are all indoor locations where chairs may be stored or used, but a folding chair may not be the most appropriate option.
The sentence implies that wearing uncomfortable shoes for a long period of time can have a negative impact on the feet. Calluses are thickened, hardened skin that develops as a protective response to pressure and friction on the skin. Therefore, it is the most likely consequence of spending a long time shopping in uncomfortable shoes. The other options, such as tiredness or sleepiness, may be related to the physical strain of standing for a long time, but they do not specifically relate to the feet. Bankruptcy and standing in line are not related to the physical consequences of wearing uncomfortable shoes.
The term "impeachment" is commonly used in a political context to refer to the removal of a government official, such as a president, from office due to illegal or unethical behavior. Therefore, the word "trouble" is the best choice as it reflects the negative consequences that impeachment could have for the president. The other options do not accurately describe the meaning of impeachment.
The context suggests that the sentence is discussing the beliefs of a noble citizen in the Roman empire towards those born with lower social status. The term "inferior" implies that the noble citizen considered themselves to be of a higher social status than those with a lower status. "Loser" and "ignoble" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of discussing beliefs towards lower social status. "Peasant" and "plebeian" may refer to lower social classes in Rome but do not necessarily convey the idea of inferiority.
The sentence suggests that spraining an ankle while playing baseball will result in a negative outcome. The word "pain" is commonly associated with injuries and is the only option that directly relates to the consequences of a sprained ankle. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence.
The presence of stained carpets with sauces and ketchup is a common occurrence in restaurants due to spills and accidents that happen in the dining area. The other options, such as bedroom, chair, bowling alley, and hotel do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or do not involve the likelihood of spilled food.
The sentence mentions a Wisconsin city known for beer, which is a clear reference to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee is often associated with its brewing industry, and is home to many major breweries such as MillerCoors and Pabst Brewing Company. The other options do not have any connection to the context clues in the sentence.
A hard to read note is likely to be on a medical chart because doctors' handwriting is notorious for being difficult to decipher. Sheet music also requires good handwriting, but it is not mentioned in the context of the sentence. The other options do not require handwriting.
Buying beer generally involves exchanging money for the product, so "spend money" is the most appropriate answer. The other choices are not relevant to the context of buying beer. "Have no money" would prevent someone from buying beer, "pants" and "relaxation" are not related to buying beer, and "lose money" implies that the person is not intentionally trying to buy beer, but is losing money in some other way.
Gum on shoes is commonly associated with stepping on discarded gum on the sidewalk. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is unable to pay their bills, indicating a financial struggle. Therefore, the best solution would be to increase their income by making more money. The other options, such as knowing everything or throwing a party, do not address the problem of not being able to pay bills. Acknowledgment may be necessary but is not a solution, while spare time is irrelevant.
The question is asking about the main benefit of exercising, which suggests that there may be multiple benefits but one outweighs the others. The option "healthy" is the most general and all-encompassing option, as exercising can benefit overall health by improving cardiovascular health, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting mental well-being. While losing weight and getting in shape are commonly associated with exercising, they are more specific benefits that may not be applicable to everyone. The option "sweat" is not a benefit of exercising but rather a side effect of physical exertion.
The sentence suggests that Steve had some doubts about the possibility of something, but ultimately agreed that it was a certain way. The word "possible" indicates that there was some chance of the thing happening, but Steve's agreement suggests that it was not very likely. The word "unlikely" fits best with this context. The other options suggest a stronger sense of impossibility or inability, which does not seem to be what Steve was expressing.
The question refers to a specific area of a west coast city, indicating that the answer will be a specific location within that city. The mention of a Japanese restaurant suggests that the answer will be a neighborhood with a significant Japanese community, and the word "region" implies a specific area within the city. California and Tokio are not specific neighborhoods within a city, and Narnia is a fictional location. Large town may refer to many different cities or neighborhoods, but does not provide any specific information about where a Japanese restaurant may be located.
The question asks for a tactic that interferes with learning about science, which suggests that the answer will be something negative or harmful. Intimidation is a tactic where someone tries to create fear or anxiety in another person, which can make it difficult for them to focus or feel comfortable learning. On the other hand, the other options are more likely to be positive or neutral approaches to learning, such as repetition to reinforce knowledge, a sense of wonder to encourage curiosity, accidents as opportunities for exploration, or increased knowledge as a desirable outcome.
Falling in love is typically associated with positive emotions such as happiness, excitement, and joy. While getting married may be a result of falling in love, it is not a universal experience and not all people who fall in love get married. Pain and suffering are also possible outcomes of love, but they are not the most common or expected emotions associated with it.
The sentence suggests that the tiger was confined in a place where he was unable to move around or hunt for food, which caused him to become lazy and gain weight. Zoos are a common place where animals are kept in captivity for public observation and are often criticized for their impact on animal welfare. The other options, such as jungle (where animals typically live free in the wild), kill (which does not make sense in the context of the sentence), india (which is a location but not related to the sentence), and eat cake (which is a joke answer) do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that parents are telling their child what to do on the weekend, which implies leisure time. "Go out to play" is a commonly used phrase by parents to encourage their children to engage in physical activity or socializing with friends during their free time. The other options suggest activities that would typically occur during the school week or chores that the child should do at home.
This question refers to the popular phrase "man's best friend," which is often used to describe the close relationship between humans and dogs. The phrase usually implies a sense of loyalty and companionship, which is why the correct answer is "very loyal." While dogs can have different personalities and intelligence levels, none of the other options directly relate to the phrase "man's best friend."
A two wheel transportation machine is most likely referring to a bicycle, which can typically be bought at a bicycle shop. The other options such as boat and train station do not make sense in the context of the question, while michigan and trunk of car are not places where you can buy a bicycle.
The context of the question implies that the answer must relate to a place where an alien might be found, and where a vacuum might be useful. Among the choices, space is the most logical answer, as it is the location where aliens are commonly depicted in science fiction, and where a vacuum would be necessary for various reasons, such as maintaining air pressure or removing debris. The other options, such as closet, kitchen, orbit, and container do not make as much sense in the context of the question.
Condoms are typically sold as a preventive measure against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies. They are widely available in supermarkets, drugstores, and convenience stores, and sometimes in family planning clinics or health centers. The other options listed do not sell condoms, but may be places where one keeps or uses them.

The word "rendezvous" suggests that the soldier is supposed to meet someone there, which implies that they are waiting for someone to give them further instructions. Additionally, the phrase "supposed to" implies that the soldier was given a specific purpose for going to the rendezvous point, and that purpose is likely to be fulfilled by waiting for further instructions rather than immediately engaging in combat. The other answer choices may be plausible in other contexts, but they do not fit the specific language used in this sentence.
The sentence is discussing the act of killing someone with a gun, which is achieved by shooting the gun at the person. The other options do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the hostess was leading employees somewhere related to their work. "Work room" is the only option that fits this context, as it implies a space where employees can work or perform their job duties. "Group people" and "welcome guests" do not make sense in this context, while "occupations" and "seat customer" are too general and do not provide enough information to determine the correct answer.
Unused soap is typically stored in a cabinet or other storage area within a person's own home. Supermarkets and jails would not be appropriate places to store personal hygiene items, and "butt" is not a proper storage location.
The sentence suggests that the loss of someone you love can have a negative impact on your emotions. The word "painful" is commonly associated with feelings of sadness, grief, and loss. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "happy" and "bring joy" are the opposite of the sentiment expressed in the sentence, "blind" is unrelated to emotions, and "contagious" is not a feeling.
The question is asking about where to keep a ballpoint pen when not in use, which suggests it is a common household item. The choices "backpack" and "bank" do not make sense in this context. "Eat cake" is completely unrelated to the question. The option "office desk" could be a possible answer, but "desk drawer" specifically refers to a place to store items when not in use, making it the most logical choice.
The context suggests that James was not concerned with the truth and did not prioritize it. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a choice that reflects a lack of importance given to the truth. "Matter to" implies that the truth was not significant or relevant to James, which fits the given context. The other options do not necessarily reflect a lack of importance given to the truth.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a specific type of housing community where all of the yards are the same size and have the same type of landscaping. This is a common characteristic of subdivisions, which are planned communities consisting of similar homes and landscaping. The other options, such as a city or parking garage, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not typically have uniform yards or landscaping. The option "three feet" does not make sense in relation to the question. Michigan may have subdivisions, but the sentence does not provide any specific information about the location the speaker is looking for.
The sentence mentions that the flask was used for distilling elements, which is a process commonly carried out in a laboratory or chemistry lab. These environments are equipped with the necessary equipment and resources to conduct such experiments. The other options, such as a coat pocket or bordello, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and would not be appropriate settings for distilling elements.
The sentence indicates that the man expressed his anger violently, which suggests that he may be in an agitated or heated state. In order to help him calm down and regain control of his emotions, he was likely encouraged to "cool off." This phrase means to take a break, step away from the situation, and allow time for the angry feelings to dissipate. The other options either involve physical aggression (punch, fight) or do not address the need for emotional regulation (illustrate point, release energy).
Playing a triangle is a musical skill, so the correct answer must relate to music. Math class and math book are not relevant, as they don't involve music. Pythagoras was a famous mathematician, not a musician, so being in his band is not a plausible scenario. Orchestra is a close option, but it may not necessarily include learning how to play a triangle specifically. Therefore, music class is the most appropriate choice, as it would likely cover a broad range of musical skills, including playing percussion instruments like the triangle.
The sentence suggests that the guys preferred to have a regular poker game over going to the movies, indicating that the purpose of their activity was more social than competitive or strictly for entertainment. The phrase "rather than going to the movies" implies that they had options for how to spend their time, and chose the one that allowed them to socialize and connect with each other. The options "competition" and "losing money" imply a more intense or negative experience, whereas "fun game" and "fun" do not capture the social aspect of the activity as well as "social event."
The sentence suggests that the action being described involves interacting with a dog, specifically by stroking their fur. This action is commonly referred to as "petting" a dog. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that Dan fell off a bar stool, which suggests that he may have been sitting at a bar or in some other drinking establishment. The next part of the sentence suggests that the reason Dan fell off the stool was because he was "drunker" than ever before. This implies that Dan had consumed a significant amount of alcohol, which affected his balance and coordination. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woodworker needs to make the wood smooth to the touch. This is typically done by sanding the wood with sandpaper until the roughness has been removed. Petrifying wood means turning it into stone, which is not relevant in this context. Warping wood means twisting or bending it out of shape, which is not a solution to make the wood smooth. Composting wood means turning it into organic matter, which is not relevant in this context. Cleaning wood may remove surface dirt, but it will not make the wood smooth to the touch.
The sentence suggests that the chief was a leader of a tribe, which is commonly associated with indigenous or Native American communities. The choice of words such as "tribe" and "Indian" support this association, while the other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. Additionally, the sentence implies that the chief was the sole survivor of the tribe, which emphasizes the tragedy and loss he experienced.
The sentence suggests that the flower's neighbor was taller and blocked the sunlight, necessitating the flower to grow taller to compete. The phrase "cast shadow" implies that the neighbor was blocking the sunlight, making this the correct answer. The other choices, such as "blossom," "park," "open," and "vase" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The scenario presented involves another driver making a careless maneuver while the subject is driving to work. This suggests a potential conflict or dangerous situation on the road, which may elicit a strong emotional response from the subject. "Road rage" is a commonly used term to describe intense anger or frustration experienced while driving, often in response to perceived reckless or aggressive behavior by other drivers. The other options do not have any connection to the scenario or the potential emotions that may arise from it.
The question refers to food that can cause sickness, which implies that the correct answer must be something that is harmful to consume. None of the other options have any clear association with causing illness. "Boat" and "kitchen" are objects and "necessary to live" and "edible" describe characteristics that do not necessarily indicate if a food is harmful or not. "Unhealthy" directly suggests that a type of food is not good for one's health and can cause sickness.
The vertices of a triangle are the points where the three sides meet. Therefore, the sharpest parts of the triangle (the points with the smallest angle measurement) would be located at the three vertices. The point, on the other hand, refers to a single location in space and does not necessarily have any connection to the shape of a triangle. The math book is not a relevant option, as it does not relate to the concept being discussed. The options "3 sides" and "three sides" are essentially the same, but the use of the numeral "3" is more appropriate in this context.
Freeways are typically designed with exit ramps that allow vehicles to safely leave the high-speed traffic and merge onto local roads or highways. Garages, driveways, and repair shops are not typically located next to freeways and would not provide direct access onto the road. Stop lights are more commonly found on local roads and would not be used to exit a freeway. The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to navigation and transportation on a roadway.
The sentence suggests that going to bed with your spouse for sex leads to a particular outcome, and the most likely option is a good night's sleep. This is because sex is often associated with physical exertion and relaxation, which makes it easier to fall asleep afterwards. The other options are unlikely to be the outcome of having sex with one's spouse, as they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the repeated surprising shows are becoming bothersome or irritating. The other options do not accurately reflect the negative sentiment conveyed by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally believes there is a risk involved in competing, which may lead to added pressure. If she were to push more, it is likely that she would feel more pressure to succeed in her efforts. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that John is sitting in a toilet stall in a bathroom and can hear cars going around in circles outside, which suggests that he is in an enclosed and private space typically used for personal hygiene purposes. The other options (eating food, public place, race track, at hotel, public building) are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not explain why John would be hearing cars going around in circles.
The word "seats" suggests that the event is performed in a venue where one needs to buy a ticket to be assigned a specific place to sit. Options like "park" and "rest area" do not require tickets and do not have reserved seating available. "Movies" do have assigned seating at some theaters, but it is not commonly referred to as buying tickets for seats. The options "auditorium" and "show" are more likely to have assigned seating and require tickets for entry. "Show" specifically refers to a performance or entertainment event, while "auditorium" can be used for various events, but often refers to a performance space.
The phrase "high-traffic space" implies that the merchant wanted to rent a space that would receive a lot of foot traffic. A mall is a location where many people go to shop, making it a high-traffic location for businesses. The other options, such as "business" and "store," are too broad and do not specifically indicate a space with high foot traffic. "Sale" and "sell goods" are not locations at all, but rather actions related to selling.
The word "copulating" implies that the newlyweds are engaging in sexual intercourse, which is often done with the intention of procreation. The desire for "many" of something further supports the idea that they are hoping to have children. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question asks how a planet moves around the sun, and the term "orbit" specifically refers to the path that a planet takes as it revolves around a star. The other choices are not relevant to the context of the question, and may even be misleading (e.g. "writing" and "universe").
The context of the sentence suggests that the group of people are at work and are engaged in some form of communication. The phrase "sharing of ideas" is commonly associated with workplace communication where colleagues discuss their thoughts and insights related to work-related topics. The other options such as coughing, speaking, and sneezing are generic actions that may occur during workplace communication but are not specific to the act of exchanging ideas. Having a concert is not related to the context of the sentence.
Punching is often associated with the emotion of anger, as people may physically lash out when feeling frustrated, annoyed, or provoked. The other options listed are physical objects or actions, rather than emotions. While fists and hands are necessary body parts to punch, they do not explain the root cause of the action, which is typically anger or aggression. Boxing gloves may be associated with punching, but they do not necessarily cause the emotion that leads to it.
The sentence suggests that they have been doing things a certain way for a while and now the speaker suggests that they try something else. The word "differently" implies that they should try doing things in a new or different way. The other options - "otherwise", "expensive", "only", and "mere" - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Sharks are predominantly found in bodies of water such as oceans, seas, rivers and lakes. Given that the other options do not involve bodies of water, Tamales Bay is the most plausible location for a shark to be found before it was caught. Tamales Bay is an inlet in California that connects to the Pacific Ocean and is known to be home to many different species of marine life including sharks.
Poker chips are commonly used in gambling games such as poker, which are often played in bars or casinos. The other options (supermarket, pantry, motherboard) do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence presents two different ways of approaching dance - one is elegant and specific, while the other is more focused on having fun. The correct answer is an option that aligns with the idea of having fun without any negative consequences. Falling down, tripping, or falling down do not fit with an enjoyable dance experience, and therefore can be eliminated. Celebrate is too broad of an option and not specific to dance, leaving move around as the only fitting choice.
The question is asking for where one can obtain a bass fiddle, which is a musical instrument. Out of the five options, only "music store" specifically mentions a place where instruments can be bought. The other options refer to musical groups or songs, and do not provide a clear answer to the question.
The phrase "having a disability" suggests that the difficulty with academic tasks may be related to a cognitive or physical impairment. The term "mentally challenged" specifically refers to individuals with intellectual disabilities, which can make it harder for them to process and apply new information. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why having a disability might affect academic tasks.
Playing games is often seen as a way for children to learn and develop important skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication. Winning and losing are usually not the primary focus of children's games, and fatigue is not a positive outcome of playing games. Skill may be developed through playing games, but it is not the primary purpose of playing games for children.
The sentence suggests that killing people is a heinous crime that would result in a severe punishment. The only option that aligns with this context is "prison sentence." "Feelings of guilt" might be a natural consequence of such an action, but it is not a legal consequence. "Terrible" and "die" are not appropriate outcomes for the crime of murder. "Encouragement" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person who laughs after being surprised has a good sense of something, and the context of the sentence indicates that it is related to the act of laughing. This is further supported by the options "joy" and "laughter," which are also related to the act of laughing. However, the option "humor" is the best fit as it directly relates to the situation described in the sentence. A good sense of humor means that someone has the ability to find things funny, which would explain why they laugh after being surprised. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people were playing games in a specific location and that location was similar to something else. The options "town", "beach", and "near" don't really fit because they don't describe a specific type of location. "Outside" is too vague and doesn't describe a specific place. "Park" is the best option because it is a specific type of location where people often play games, making it the closest thing to the soccer field where the games were being played.
High schools typically have more funding and resources to invest in their cafeteria facilities and provide a wider variety of nutritious and tasty food options for students. Canteens and polytechnics may have smaller budgets allotted for food services, while "large room" and "all kinds of schools" offer no information about the quality of their cafeterias.
The sentence suggests that the person being described lacks knowledge and is making judgments, which is commonly associated with ignorance. Ignorance refers to a lack of knowledge or information about a particular subject. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman was trying to improve her physical fitness level, but had trouble staying committed to a particular activity. The term "work out" refers to any type of physical activity that is done with the intention of improving one's health and fitness, so it makes the most sense as the correct answer. The other options are all related to physical activity, but do not necessarily imply the same level of commitment or intentionality as the phrase "work out."
The sentence implies that when someone is doing something and having fun, they are likely doing something that they enjoy. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "spontaneous" refers to something unplanned or impulsive, "stop working" refers to ceasing an activity altogether, "pay for" refers to the act of providing money for something, and "do like" is redundant with "enjoy."
The term "salesman" typically refers to someone whose job is to sell products or services to customers. The other options do not fit the general job description of a salesman, as they either relate to specific locations or negative job outcomes.
Research has shown that exercise, such as jogging, can have a positive impact on one's self esteem by improving mood, reducing stress, and building a sense of accomplishment. Feeling better and having an increased sense of pride are common outcomes of exercise on self esteem. Sweating is a physical response to exercise and not related to self esteem, while the ocean and arthritis are not relevant to the context of the question.
The context of people standing in a line outside suggests a place where people are waiting for something, such as transportation. A bus depot is a common location where people line up outside to wait for a bus, making it the best answer choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath, which is a crime. The other options do not accurately describe perjury. Disrespecting a judge or feeling embarrassed are not the same as lying under oath, and an indictment is a formal accusation of a crime, not the act of committing one.
"Ficus" is a word, so the logical place to find its meaning is in a dictionary. The other options do not provide any relevant information or resources to find the meaning of the word.
Economic boom refers to a period of time when a country's economy is thriving, and people have more disposable income to spend. During an economic boom, people tend to buy more products as they have more money to spend, which is backed up by data analyzing consumer behavior during economic recoveries. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the buildings were not designed for residential purposes, which suggests that they were built for a different type of use. One option that fits this description is a university, which often has buildings specifically designed for classrooms, offices, and other non-residential purposes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the ability to fly is somehow related to the lightweight and hollow nature of a particular body part in animals. Tails, eyes, heads, and bodies do not have any clear connection to this idea, whereas bones can be lightweight and hollow in certain animals. This characteristic can help them reduce overall weight and increase their ability to fly or glide.
The sentence suggests that the child is experiencing a sense of disbelief or skepticism towards something that other people accept as real. The phrase "it was all pretend" implies that the child feels like everyone else is pretending or fooling themselves. The option "people believe" directly relates to this context, as it suggests the child is struggling with understanding why others believe in something that feels fake to them. The other options, such as daydreams, transcendentalism, laughter, and religion, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Glacial lakes are formed by glaciers melting and filling the depressions they created. Mountains are often associated with glaciers, so it is more likely to find glacial lakes in mountainous areas. The other options do not have a strong connection to glacial lakes.
The sentence mentions that they needed grape juice and other snacks for their party, which suggests that they were looking for a place where they could buy food and drinks. The options "field," "restaurant," and "salad" do not fit this context, as they do not typically sell packaged or bottled grape juice. "Food store" could be a viable option, but "market" is a more general term that can refer to a variety of food vendors or stalls, making it a more likely answer.
The sentence implies that people obtain passports for the purpose of traveling to different locations. The choice "desire to travel" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the concept of obtaining a passport and traveling. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Apples form on an apple tree after the tree has bloomed. The bloom contains the reproductive structures of the tree, which will eventually develop into fruit if pollination occurs. The other options are not relevant to the process of apple formation on a tree.
Nightclubs are typically concentrated in urban areas with a high population density, particularly in downtown areas where there is a significant demand for nightlife entertainment. While Manhattan and major cities may also have a high concentration of nightclubs, the option "downtown area" is the most specific and directly related to the context of the question. The options "drink and dance" and "alcohol" are not relevant as they do not refer to specific locations.
The question is asking for a characteristic that machines possess that humans do not. While humans are capable of answering questions and flying (with the aid of technology), machines are specifically designed for performing work and can do so in a more efficient and consistent manner than humans. The option "fail to work" is not a characteristic unique to machines, as humans can also fail to work due to various reasons. "See work" is also a vague option with no clear explanation or context provided.
Breathing is a vital function of living beings and ceases when someone is dead. The other options do not pertain to the cessation of vital functions and are therefore incorrect.
The context of the sentence suggests that the linen closet is located in a space with only one overhead light, which would make it difficult to see in a dark or poorly-lit area. The options "house," "home," and "pool house" are too broad and do not provide any specific information about the location of the linen closet. The option "bedroom" may be a possibility, but the phrase "really needs repainting a light color" suggests that the area is larger than just a bedroom. The best option is "hallway," which is a space often used to connect rooms in a house and may have only one overhead light.
The sentence suggests that punk rock music is connected to a sport, and the only option that could be associated with a sport is "skate." Skateboarding culture has a strong connection to punk rock music, so this answer makes sense. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where a mouse might be found to make it "country," implying that the setting is rural or rustic. The option "old barn" fits this description, as it is a common feature found in the countryside. The other options do not have any connection to this context and do not suggest a rural environment.
Birds typically make their homes in nests, which are built using twigs, grass, and other materials. Nests provide birds with shelter and protection for their young, and they are often located in trees or other elevated locations. The other options are not likely locations for a bird's home. Forests may offer nesting sites, but the option specifically says "forest" instead of "trees" or "wooded areas," making it less likely to be the correct answer. Roof and sky do not typically have natural materials suitable for building a nest, and leaves would not provide sufficient shelter or protection.
The sentence suggests that the person is hungry early in the day, which implies that it is the beginning of the day, such as in the morning. Eating breakfast is a common solution to alleviate hunger in the morning, while the other choices either don't fit the time of day or don't specifically address the issue of hunger in the context of the sentence.
The question asks how to express information without a pen or pencil, which suggests that the answer requires a method of communication that does not involve writing. Talking is a common alternative to writing, and is often used in situations where someone needs to convey information verbally. The other options are not relevant to the question or do not provide an effective means of expressing information without writing.
The word "monsters" usually refers to scary or terrifying creatures, which can cause fear in people. This is supported by common stories and movies about monsters, where people are often portrayed as being frightened or terrified of them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "examine" implies a close inspection or analysis of something. The other choices do not necessarily require close examination. "Buy" implies a transaction, whereas "learn about" implies acquiring knowledge. "Complex" and "interesting" suggest characteristics, but not necessarily a need for close examination. Therefore, "learn about" is the most appropriate choice.
Drinking alcohol can lead to various effects, including intoxication. Intoxication is the state of being drunk, which can impair judgment, motor skills, and coordination. Vomiting and nausea are also possible effects of alcohol consumption, especially when excessive amounts are consumed or when alcohol is consumed on an empty stomach. However, "having fun" and "drinking more alcohol" are not necessarily negative consequences, but they may lead to negative consequences if done in excess.
The sentence suggests that the bass clarinet is being played in conjunction with other woodwind instruments, which is a common orchestral arrangement. Orchestras typically feature a variety of instruments, including woodwinds, brass, and strings, and are often associated with classical music. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that has the opposite meaning of "a little." In this case, the opposite would be a word that means a large amount or quantity. Among the choices given, "much" is the only one that fits this description, as it indicates a significant amount of something. The other options do not have the opposite meaning of "a little."
The sentence suggests that the princess had a pristine or virtuous character, which the evil wizard wished to ruin in some way. Corrupt is the most fitting option as it means to change something or someone for the worse, often morally. The other options do not have as strong of a connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the piece of paper was valuable and associated with Apple Inc, which suggests that it may be a financial document. A stock certificate is a legal document that represents ownership in a company and can have significant value, especially if the company is successful like Apple Inc. The other options do not have any clear connection to Apple Inc or the concept of value.
The sentence implies that the speaker was able to hear everything in the woods because of the stillness of everything. Being still, stationary, standing still, and being silent can all contribute to stillness, but stillness is the specific word used in the sentence to describe the lack of motion in the woods.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to listen to talk radio in private, which implies that they do not want others around them to hear it. Among the choices provided, the only option that offers privacy is the bedroom. The trunk, diner, space shuttle, and shop do not provide a private listening environment for the person.
Based on the context of the sentence, Billy is an astronaut, and when he looked at the world from space, it suggests that he could see the whole planet. The common perception of the Earth is that it is round, which is the answer choice that fits best with the context. The other answer choices do not fit with the context of the sentence.
A fireplace is a common feature in a living room, which is often the central gathering place in a home. A big house or cabin may have multiple fireplaces throughout, but the living room is a typical location for a fireplace. A train or home are not typical settings for a fireplace, and do not provide much context for the question.
The question suggests that the answer is related to a danger or risk associated with cats. Cats and dogs are often seen as natural enemies, and it is not uncommon for dogs to attack or even kill cats. Therefore, finding your cat in a dog's mouth would be the worst possible scenario for a cat owner. The other options, such as trouble, backyard, nature, or home, do not necessarily imply a danger to the cat.
The term "kosher" refers to food that is prepared according to Jewish dietary laws, which suggests that the deli is likely located in a place with a significant Jewish population. Of the choices given, only New York City and Jewish neighborhoods specifically mention Jewish communities, making them the most likely options. However, the fact that the sentence mentions "a number of different places to eat" suggests that the deli is located in a more general area with multiple food options, which makes New York City the most likely answer.
The phrase "going to market" traditionally refers to a trip to a local market to purchase goods, typically food. The phrase "buying vegetables" is the most specific and relevant choice to this context, as it is a common item people purchase at markets. "Buy food" and "buy a fat pig" are also possible choices, but they are more general and do not specifically indicate a trip to the market. "See other people" and "traveling" are unlikely choices because they do not connect to the context of purchasing goods at a market.
The sentence indicates that the person was worried about having cancer but was eventually reassured that they did not have it. Therefore, it is likely that they would feel relieved and grateful for this news, rather than feeling bored or concluding something else. Pain may have been a potential outcome if they had developed cancer, but that is not the case in this sentence. Happiness could be a possible emotional response, but given the situation, relief is the more appropriate choice.
Having fun is commonly associated with experiencing pleasure and enjoyment. Smiling and laughter are often outward expressions of pleasure, while hurt and injuries are negative sensations that are not related to the feeling of having fun.
The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a problem with crumbs getting under their table, which is a common issue that can be solved by placing a rug or mat underneath the table. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A conference room or card room would not be relevant in this situation, while placing a net or moving to a neighbor's house would not solve the problem.
In Christianity, the concept of being "born again" refers to a spiritual transformation where a person accepts Jesus Christ and becomes a new creation. It is believed that this decision leads to salvation and the promise of eternal life in heaven after death. The other options do not align with this belief or have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James is not skilled at surfing, which means he is likely to fall off his board or wipe out. "Wipe out" is a term commonly used in the context of surfing to describe the act of falling off one's surfboard. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that Sarah gave her brother a "guy", which is likely a typo or a misspelling of "key". Keys are commonly used to turn locks to open doors, so the correct answer is "turn lock". The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or are too general to apply specifically to the situation described.
The term "mammoth" refers to a group of extinct elephant-like mammals that lived during the prehistoric period. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to periods in the past, such as "prehistoric times" or "ancient times." The other options, such as "boscage" and "forest," are not specific to any time period and do not provide any contextual clues to the answer.
The sentence suggests that the murderer felt a sense of guilt or regret after committing the act of murder, which is often referred to as remorse. This feeling may have led them to seek solace or forgiveness in a religious setting such as a church. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as retaliation would imply the murderer felt one had wronged them, religious would suggest that they went to church for reasons unrelated to their crime, and anguish wouldn't explain why they went to church.
An unsuccessful suicide attempt means that the person did not succeed in taking their own life. Interruption could refer to someone or something stopping the person in the middle of the attempt, such as someone discovering them or a sudden change of heart. Bleeding could happen as a result of the attempt, but does not necessarily mean the attempt was unsuccessful. The options "die" and "dying" are not appropriate answers as they would refer to a successful attempt, while "hatred" is not relevant to the context of the question.
The question suggests that there may be some conflict or negative outcome associated with buying products that someone else does not want you to buy. The word "disagreements" suggests that there may be an argument or disagreement between the person buying the product and someone else who does not approve of the purchase. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the question.
The father's reminder after each gift suggests that the child needs to do something that shows gratitude towards the gift-giver. Showing appreciation is a common way to acknowledge a gift, and is often expected in social situations. Asking for or exchanging the gift would be considered rude, while simply saying "thank you" or smiling may not be seen as sufficient to express gratitude in some cultures.
The sentence suggests that Bob is surrounded by trees and nature, which is a characteristic commonly associated with state parks. State parks are often scenic areas that provide opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking or picnicking, which may explain why Bob is in this location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that Bart entered his horse into a contest, which is typically held at events such as fairs or shows. Of the given options, the state fair is the most likely location for such a contest. The other options, such as a circus or a western movie, do not typically hold horse contests. In Kentucky, there are many horse competitions, but the sentence does not provide any indication that Bart entered his horse in a specific competition in Kentucky. Central Park is in New York City and would not be a typical location for a horse contest.
Snowflakes form in clouds when water vapor freezes onto tiny particles, such as dust, that are floating in the air. This process is known as nucleation. As more and more water vapor freezes onto the particle, it builds up into a crystal, which eventually falls to the ground as a snowflake. The other choices may be related to snow, but they do not accurately describe the formation process of a snowflake.
The sentence mentions power tools and fixing cars, which suggests that the location is likely a place where vehicles are repaired. The term "workplace" also suggests that this is a professional environment, rather than a personal one (such as a basement or tool shed). The most appropriate location from the given options is a repair shop, where mechanics would use power tools like drills to fix cars. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that applying for a job can have a negative emotional impact, even if the person gets the job. The word "even" implies that getting the job does not necessarily eliminate the negative emotion. Stress is a common emotion associated with job applications because of the pressure of the job search process and the potential impact it can have on an individual's future. The other options do not have the same association with job applications and are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence mentions that the farmer sees a weasel in the woods, which suggests that the setting is outside in a natural environment. Of the given choices, "great outdoors" is the only option that matches this description. The other options (chicken coop, beach, fairytale, corn fields) do not fit the context of the sentence.
Skipping stones is a common activity done on bodies of water, particularly shallow ones like ponds. A lake and an aquarium are unlikely choices, as they are either too big or too small for this activity. A manual refers to a collection of instructions or a guidebook, while a playground is not typically associated with skipping stones.
The sentence suggests that the act of traveling from one new place to another is being described. The word "likely" implies that the answer choice reflects a common experience associated with this type of travel. The option "exhausting" is a common experience associated with frequent travel, as it often involves long periods of sitting, uncomfortable sleeping arrangements, and jet lag. The other options do not reflect common experiences associated with this type of travel.
The sentence implies that Turkey has a small area in the north that is part of a larger region or area. The Balkan Peninsula is a well-known geographic region in southeastern Europe, and Turkey does indeed have a small section of land in the northern Balkans (Thrace). The other options (middle east, oven, provide meat, Asia Minor) have no clear connection to the geography of Turkey described in the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the person is looking for a place to store a reusable shopping bag, indicating that they likely own one and want to keep it easily accessible for future use. The most logical place to store a personal item like this would be in one's own home. The other options - supermarket, mart, obesity, and closet - do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not places where one would typically store their own personal belongings.
The question is asking for an activity that can be done alone and still be enjoyable. The options "fairgrounds" and "friend's house" suggest social activities, which wouldn't meet the criteria of being alone. "Watching television" may be an option for some, but it doesn't necessarily imply having fun. "Tired" is not an activity or something that can bring enjoyment. "Enjoyable" is the most appropriate option as it suggests an activity that can be done alone and enjoyed.
This question requires some external knowledge, as there is no clear context given in the sentence. One way to approach it would be to think about famous agriculture or food products associated with different states or regions. In this case, Maryland is known for its prominent role in the history of the potato industry, with the state's Eastern Shore being a major producer of seed potatoes. Therefore, it is likely that the potato is considered to be the official vegetable of Maryland. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the location where the sky is most beautiful, which implies a physical setting. The planetarium and photo options may show beautiful skies, but they are not actual locations. The atmosphere is too broad of a term to be a specific location, and night could refer to any outdoor location where the sky is visible. Therefore, the correct answer is outdoors, as this refers to the physical setting where people can experience the beauty of the sky firsthand.
Citrus fruits, such as oranges, tangerines, and grapefruits, are commonly known for being easily segmented into sections. This feature is due to the fruit's natural tissue structure, which allows for easy separation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that marathon runners who push themselves too hard may experience something more severe than just fatigue after running 26 miles. Although all of the choices may be possible outcomes of overexertion, passing out is commonly associated with pushing oneself too hard during exercise. Marathon runners may experience decreased blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting or passing out. The other options are not likely to occur in this context.
The sentence suggests that Billy's father experienced something traumatic that has affected him since then. The only answer choice that relates to a traumatic event is "death". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is feeling cold and needs to find a way to warm up. Staying in bed can help as it allows the body to generate and retain heat. The other options are unlikely to help the person warm up, and some (like laying on ice or spitting) may actually make them colder. Lighting a fire may help, but it may not be practical or feasible in all situations.
The sentence suggests that copulating with the wrong partner can lead to the transfer of diseases that can cause different types of negative outcomes. The choice "skin irritation" makes the most sense, as sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and syphilis can cause skin irritation and other discomforts. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence and would not make logical sense.
Clapping is a common way for audiences to show their appreciation for a performance. While cinema, movies, and show can refer to forms of entertainment that are performed live, they are not typically associated with clapping as a form of audience feedback. Hockey games may involve applause, but it is not the primary reason that people attend them. Theatre, on the other hand, is a traditional and well-known form of live entertainment that often involves applause as a way to show appreciation for actors and performers.
The question is asking where you would obtain a balalaika, suggesting that it is an instrument rather than a music-related item. The options "orchestra," "buy music," and "symphony" do not make sense in the context of obtaining an instrument, while "make music" implies creating your own balalaika from scratch rather than obtaining one. This leaves "music store," which is a common place to purchase musical instruments.
The sentence suggests that everyone was hoping for a beautiful day, but something happened with the clouds that disappointed them. "Overcast" is the only choice that directly relates to clouds and can cause disappointment since it means the sky is covered in clouds, making it less likely for the sun to come out and for bright blue skies to be visible. The other choices, such as "homely" or "misshapen," do not have anything to do with clouds or weather.
The question suggests that the unions are currently on strike and need to make demands in order to end the strike. From the context, it can be inferred that the demands need to be reasonable in order to be accepted by the employer and to ultimately bring an end to the strike. The other options do not make sense within the context of the question, such as "not go to work" which would not be a demand that unions would make since they are already not working due to the strike.
The sentence describes the landscaper working with stones to create a structure over a creek, which strongly suggests that the landscaper is building a bridge. The other options - park, field, and balloon - are unlikely choices for something that involves carefully placing stones, while "made from rocks" is too vague to be a clear choice.
The sentence suggests that John's marriage is not going well, and he and his wife have grown apart. This indicates that recent turns in their relationship have been negative, which aligns with the option "unfortunate." The other options do not accurately describe the situation. "Inappropriate" and "unsatisfied" are too vague and do not provide enough context to be correct. "Sadness" is an emotion and not a description of recent events, and "disenchanted" implies that John was once enchanted with his marriage, which is not indicated in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the girls needed the light in order to do their homework, which suggests that the light was an important element for their task. The word "crucial" means essential or vital, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the relationship between the light and finishing homework.
A ticket booth is typically located at the entrance of a venue or performance space, such as a concert hall or theater. The other options, such as clerk or movie theater, do not necessarily suggest a concert or performance, and while concerts can be held indoors or in an auditorium, those terms are not specific enough to indicate a ticket booth and a concert together.
The sentence suggests that someone or someplace is famous for a superhighway with no speed limit. Europe, Germany, and industrialized countries are too broad and do not specifically refer to a superhighway with no speed limit. America has some famous highways but no superhighway with no speed limit. Therefore, the correct answer must be city.
The sentence suggests that the stone was found in a location where there is a low trickle of water. The options "ocean" and "gallbladder" do not make sense in this context, as the former is a large body of water and the latter is an organ in the human body. While a stone could potentially be found in a driveway, it is less likely to be discovered through a low trickle of water. "River bed" is a possible answer, but the use of the word "trickle" implies a smaller body of water, making "creek bed" the most likely option.
The question implies that the person asking needs salt and is looking for a place to borrow it from. The options "ocean water," "table," and "lake" are not plausible sources of salt. "Shaker" may contain salt, but it is not clear whose shaker is being referred to. "Neighbor's house" is the most logical option, as borrowing from a neighbor is a common practice and a likely source of salt.
The sentence suggests that the universe is something that has existed for a long time, regardless of what date is assigned to it. The term "very old" implies that the universe has been around for a significant amount of time, which is consistent with scientific estimates that put the age of the universe at around 13.8 billion years. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "infiniverse" and "infinite" imply that the universe is infinite in size, while "getting younger" contradicts the scientific understanding that the universe is actually expanding and becoming older. "Real" is not a logical alternative.
The sentence suggests that the meteor travels through galaxies, which are a part of something larger. The only option that refers to a larger structure is "universe." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - the Republic of Ireland is a country, the sky is a part of Earth's atmosphere, orbit refers to the path of an object around another object, and school is a place where students learn.
The word "bully" is used to describe someone who intimidates or mistreats others, often through physical or emotional abuse. One common behavior associated with bullying is making fun of others, so the correct answer is "made fun of." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the woman has an interest in the man, which implies that she wants to interact with him in some way. The most appropriate option among the given choices is "have conversation," as it is a common way of getting to know someone better. The other options may involve some form of entertainment or observation, but they do not necessarily imply a personal interaction or connection between two people.

The sentence implies that when cooking sheep meat, it is important for it to be cooked well. The options "ram" and "wolf" are not relevant to the context since they are not related to cooking or preparing sheep meat. "Lamb" is a type of sheep that is commonly consumed, but it does not give any indication of how it should be cooked. Therefore, "done" is the correct answer as it relates to the cooking process and the desired outcome of well-cooked meat.
Pursuing an advanced degree usually requires attending a university, where classes and coursework are conducted in a formal academic setting. While it's possible to study at home in a living room or in a quiet corner of a furniture store, it wouldn't be the norm for most students. Airport terminals and churches are typically not associated with academic pursuits, making them unlikely options for where you would sit while working on an advanced degree.
The sentence suggests that the answer is something related to the use of land for farming. The options "countryside," "michigan," "north dakota," and "illinois" may all have farming areas within them, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question. "Farming areas," on the other hand, directly relates to the use of land for agriculture, making it the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that a good interview after applying for a job can cause a particular feeling. Among the choices given, "hope" is the only emotion that may result from a positive interview experience. "Offer" and "income" are outcomes of a successful interview, but they are not emotions. "Rejection" and "hostile" are negative emotions that do not align with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that despite having access to computers, which allow people to find answers to their questions quickly, people are becoming duller. This suggests that the computers are not necessarily improving people's knowledge or cognitive abilities. The answer choice "advance knowledge" is the best fit, as it implies that computers should be helping people learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. The other answer choices do not fit as well, as they do not have a clear connection to the idea of computers and knowledge.
The contextual clues suggest that the cottage is located in a remote, isolated area with no other structures nearby. This is typically associated with the countryside, where individual homes are often spread out and surrounded by natural landscapes. The other options, such as mountains or a train, do not fit the description of the setting provided in the sentence.
Fairy tales often feature knights as brave and noble heroes who go on quests to save princesses or defeat evil sorcerers, which is why they are typically portrayed in a positive light. While knights also existed in the Middle Ages and were associated with castles, this does not necessarily mean they were always seen as heroes. Chess boards also feature knights, but they are simply game pieces and not associated with any specific heroic qualities. Kid's stories could refer to a variety of different genres and contexts, so it is not clear whether knights would always be portrayed as heroes in this case.
The sentence states that James doesn't have his own vehicle, which implies that he is using some form of public transportation. The most logical option among the choices provided is transit, which includes buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation. The other options, such as the library or locker room, do not require carrying a duffel bag and therefore would not be a likely reason for James to have it with him. The army barracks could be a possibility, but it is less likely given that the sentence does not suggest James is a member of the military.
The question is asking for the necessary item to smoke, and a cigarette is a common item used for smoking. The other answer choices are inappropriate and offensive, and do not relate to the question. Lighter fluid is used to start fires and is not needed for smoking. Roll joint is a reference to smoking marijuana, which is not specified or implied in the question.
The sentence suggests that James made the decision to compete, which implies that there is a possibility of winning. The option "perform better" is too vague and does not provide a clear outcome of competing. "Enemies" does not logically follow from the information presented, and "winners and losers" simply restates the concept of competition without providing a specific outcome for James. "Lose" is a possible outcome, but the sentence implies that James chose to take a risk by competing, suggesting that there is a potential for reward as well.
The sentence suggests that there is a means of transportation that can take a person to airplanes. Taxis are commonly used to transport people to airports, so this is the most likely answer. The other options are not relevant or appropriate choices for accessing airplanes.
The question asks about what happens when driving, and all of the choices could technically happen while driving. However, the context of the question suggests that the answer should be the most negative consequence that could occur while driving. While the other options may be inconvenient or annoying, a traffic accident is the most serious and potentially dangerous outcome of driving.
When we eat food, our body breaks it down into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used for energy, growth, and repair. This process is called digestion, which involves the work of various organs such as the stomach, liver, pancreas, and intestines. Weight gain may occur if we eat more calories than we burn, but it's not the primary process that occurs after having food. Falling down and gas are not related to the process of digestion. Not feeling hungry may be a result of satiety or fullness, which can occur after digestion is complete.
The word "avoid" suggests that there is a negative association with work, which could be due to a feeling of malaise or general unease. Making money, leaving home, and success are typically positive outcomes of work, so they are unlikely to be reasons for avoiding it. Bad mood is also too vague and could be caused by a variety of factors, whereas malaise specifically refers to a feeling of physical or emotional discomfort or unease.
When traveling by airplane, it is necessary to purchase tickets in order to board the plane. The other options are not directly related to the act of flying in an airplane. Being a passenger is a result of purchasing a ticket, reading is not essential to flying, adding gas is the responsibility of the airline staff, and running through checklists is done by the pilots and crew, not the passengers.
The question is asking for another name for a color that is light in shade. "Fair" is a commonly used word to describe a light complexion or hair color, and this fits the context of the question. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the question, as "basket" and "game" are not colors and "dog hair" is too generic. "Sun" may suggest a yellowish hue, but it does not clearly indicate a light shade.
The sentence suggests that something was in a drawer that Sally did not like and it made her bored. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the lion perceived its competitor as being timid, which would have given the lion an advantage in a fight. In order to assert its dominance and intimidate its competitor, the lion would likely have taken an aggressive approach. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - reckless suggests a lack of strategy, bellicose suggests a willingness to fight regardless of the situation, defensive suggests a fear of being attacked, and dauntless suggests fearlessness rather than aggression.
The sentence suggests that John is in bed, resting and afraid to disturb a snake that is slithering over him. The most likely location for this scenario to take place is in a bedroom, which is typically where people sleep and where a bed would be located. The other options (pet shops, Oklahoma, basement, dreams) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is in an urban area with nearby nightlife, which is commonly associated with downtown areas in cities. Downtown areas often have a variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance, making it an ideal location for finding a place to eat close to local nightlife. The other options, such as malls and shopping centers, may have food options but are less likely to have a vibrant nightlife scene.
The sentence suggests that studying a new subject requires a lot of thinking, which can be a mentally challenging process. However, this process is necessary in order to gain something, which indicates that the answer is likely to be a positive outcome. The word "knowledge" directly aligns with this idea, as it represents the ultimate goal of studying and learning. The other options, such as fatigue and depression, do not align with the idea of gaining something positive from studying, while "best way" is too vague and "weight" does not make sense in this context.
The other options in the choices involve speaking or vocal communication, which would not be effective if the person you want to communicate with is far away. Sending an email is a common form of written communication that can be sent instantly to someone across a distance.
The question suggests that there may have been something said by the friends during the chat that would cause a loss of trust. The other options (fever, smoke, laughing, coughing) do not seem relevant to the context of trust and chatting with friends. "Lie" is the only option that directly relates to trust and could cause a loss of trust if someone was found out to be lying.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person made their new money through shrewd trades, which is commonly associated with the stock market. Real estate could also be a possibility, but there is no mention of it in the sentence. "Eat cake" and "cookie" are nonsensical options that have no connection to the context of the sentence. "Treasure chest" may suggest riches, but it is not a likely way to make money in the modern world.
The sentence suggests that animals play an important role in something larger. "Ecosystem" refers to the complex web of interactions that exist between living organisms and their environment. Animals are a crucial component of any ecosystem, as they help to pollinate plants, control pests, and maintain the balance of the food chain. The other options do not fully capture the importance of animals in the natural world.
The sentence is asking for a storage item that can be bought at a shop to put unused items in. The most logical option is a container that can be purchased from various stores. Basements are typically not items that can be purchased at a shop, and the ocean floor is not a location for purchasing storage items. Cardboard boxes could be an option, but they may not be as durable as a container. High school is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person has digestion issues and eats a meat-filled breakfast, which can be a trigger for heartburn. Meat is a high-fat food that takes longer to digest and can cause stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest (heartburn). The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "do time" is a commonly used colloquial term for serving a sentence in prison. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of being sentenced to prison. "Scape jail" is not a proper grammatical construction, and "dream of freedom" and "become a hairdresser" do not relate to the legal penalties associated with committing a crime. "Attempt to escape" may be something a prisoner may try to do, but it is not what they are sentenced to do.
The sentence suggests that Jesse enjoys remembering the past because it helps him understand it, and understanding the past is helpful for something specific. The option "writing down" is the most logical choice because writing down memories or historical events is a common way to document and preserve the past. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that David is on vacation and he is using his binoculars to watch nesting birds. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The mention of a rosebush suggests that the question is related to a location specifically dedicated to the cultivation and display of plants, such as a botanical garden. Kew Gardens is a famous botanical garden in London that is known for its extensive collection of plants from around the world. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking to acquire a rosebush, and the most likely place to purchase one would be a garden center. Garden centers specialize in selling plants and gardening supplies, and would likely have a variety of rosebushes to choose from. The other options do not seem relevant to obtaining a rosebush - a pot could be used to plant one, a museum would not sell plants, a formal garden might have rosebushes but would not necessarily offer them for purchase, and a backyard is where one might plant a rosebush, but not where one would obtain one.
The sentence suggests that having a certain thing may result in a person feeling confident in themselves. The phrase "trust himself" implies that the thing is related to self-confidence, which is a common trait of successful individuals. The other options, such as feeling important or owning a house, do not necessarily lead to increased self-confidence or trusting oneself. The options "electrical circuit" and "know what time" seem unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Cats are often known for their unique ability to purr, which is a low vibrating sound they make when they are content or relaxed. While cats also have whiskers, sharp teeth, four legs, and sharp claws, these do not distinguish them from other animals in the same way that their purring does. Purring is a defining characteristic of cats and is often associated with their affectionate and cuddly nature.
The sentence suggests that the person is on a plane and will soon be getting off, which is what the term "deplane" means. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a dog's house is a location that can be found outside, indicating that it is likely to be located in a yard or outdoor area. The other options do not provide any useful information for determining the correct answer.
The sentence implies that tweed is not commonly found in modern clothing, which suggests that it may be more readily available in specialized fabric stores rather than mainstream clothing stores. Scotland and brown may be associated with tweed, but they do not provide a clear suggestion on where to find it. Eddie Bauer is a clothing brand but does not specifically specialize in tweed.
The question implies that the person is looking for a single grape, which is not typically found in a winery (where grapes are processed into wine) or a field (where grapes are grown for commercial purposes). While grapes may be found in a kitchen (such as in a fruit bowl or refrigerator), the most likely place to find a single grape is at a fruit stand, which typically sells a variety of fruits in small quantities. The option 'food' is too broad to give any specific information.
When climbing up a cliff, it is important to grab onto rocks or other stable objects to ensure safety and prevent falling. Looking down or throwing rocks could be dangerous and counterproductive. "Falling" and "may fall" are not actions one would take when climbing up a cliff.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person needs to buy a replacement hose for their compressor, which is a type of tool commonly used in home improvement projects. The most likely place to find replacement parts for tools would be a hardware store, which specializes in selling equipment and supplies for construction, repair, and maintenance. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and would not provide the necessary replacement part.
The fact that the man closed his eyes implies that he was experiencing some sort of relaxation or enjoyment from the music. Additionally, the word "soothing" specifically refers to something that has a calming effect, which fits with the idea that the music helped the man to relax. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - coma suggests that the man was unconscious, enjoyable and good or bad are too general, and universal doesn't make sense in this context.
The sentence uses the terms "framing," "truss" and "beam," which are commonly associated with the construction of a building or structure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the terms used in the sentence.
A computer hard drive is a device used for storing data and is commonly referred to as a disk or disk drive. The other options, such as a cd player or usb mouse, are not used for storing data in the same way as a hard drive.
