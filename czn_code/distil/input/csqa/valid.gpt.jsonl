The word \"ignore\" implies that the authorities or whoever imposed the sanctions did not consider the school's efforts to be important or effective. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not convey the idea of disregarding or discounting the school's efforts."}

Where might he go?"}}, "k": "populated areas\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sammy is looking for a place where there are people. Populated areas is the only choice that directly relates to this, as it can refer to areas where there is a high concentration of people living or working. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A race track, the desert, an apartment, and a roadblock may not necessarily have a lot of people around."}

The word \"atlas\" refers to a collection of maps or charts, often used as a reference for navigating. This makes it the most likely answer choice, since it highlights the type of resource that has been made redundant by the advent of digital mapping services.

This indicates that the fox was likely searching for a more suitable living environment, or its natural habitat. The other choices, such as pretty flowers or a storybook, do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while a hen house may be a potential target for a fox's hunting instincts but does not fit the idea of the fox looking for a habitat."}

The options \"carpet\" and \"coach\" do not make sense as places to store food. \"Breadbox\" is a possibility, but the word \"refrigerator\" is specifically mentioned in one of the options, making it the most likely choice."}

The other options may be popular locations for restaurants, but they do not specifically cater to the business clientele. A restaurant in a town could attract locals and tourists, while a restaurant at a hotel may be more geared towards guests, and a restaurant in a mall may attract shoppers. Yellow pages, on the other hand, is a directory service and not a physical location."}

Where is he?"}}, "k": "garden\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Johnny is in a peaceful and relaxing environment, which is commonly associated with gardens. Gardens often have benches or other seating areas for visitors to sit and enjoy the scenery, which is consistent with the description of Johnny sitting on a bench to relax. The other options are less likely because they do not typically provide a tranquil atmosphere conducive to relaxation."}

He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what?"}}, "k": "loss of heat\nKnowledge: The phrase \"cooling off\" typically refers to a decrease in temperature or a slowing down of one's metabolism. The sentence suggests that James is cooling off too quickly, which could be dangerous if he continues to experience a significant loss of heat. \"Revenge,\" \"expansion,\" \"relaxation,\" and \"calm down\" are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that would help to determine the correct answer."}

The other options are all groups of people who may be more susceptible to illness, but they do not specifically refer to someone who is already sick. Therefore, the correct answer is likely \"sick person.\""}

The word \"fatigue\" is commonly associated with physical exhaustion after extended activity, which makes it the best choice. \"Excitement\" and \"anger\" do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not negative effects. \"Hurting\" is too specific and doesn't encompass all the different ways playing soccer can affect the body. \"Getting tired\" is similar to \"fatigue\" but is not as specific and does not capture the full extent of physical exhaustion."}

The options \"freeway,\" \"radio,\" and \"electrical circuit\" don't match the context of file sharing. \"Wires\" could be a possible answer, but it is too vague and could refer to different types of wires. Therefore, the correct answer is likely \"computer network,\" which is a logical connection to file sharing."}

He constantly worried about what?"}}, "k": "being found out\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean is fearful of being caught in a lie. The phrase \"lying about the body\" implies that Sean is not telling the truth about something serious, possibly even a crime. Therefore, he is likely worried about being found out and facing consequences for his actions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

In this context, \"run errands\" is likely a code for a specific task, such as collecting money from the dealers. The phrase \"take money\" is the only option that is directly related to the drug trade and would be a logical task for the dealers to do. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The demand is driving what to carry them?"}}, "k": "pet shops\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that there is a high demand for exotic snakes as pets, which suggests that these snakes are being sold in pet shops. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - \"ditch\" and \"outdoors\" are not places where snakes would typically be sold, and \"north america\" is not relevant to the sentence. \"Shop\" could be a possible answer, but without the context of the sentence specifying what kind of shop it is, it is less likely than \"pet shops\" as an answer."}

Among them, the family of the victim did something to him.

Packing or bagging may be necessary to bring along cooking equipment and ingredients, but it is not a crucial step in the cooking process. Having a match handy is also important in order to start the fire."}

The word \"thick\" implies that his semen was previously viscous or dense, but the word \"but\" indicates that there has been a contrast in consistency. The word \"thin\" is the most appropriate choice to convey this shift in texture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Maine, Boston, beach towns, and coastal cities all fit this description and are likely places to find seafood restaurants. The option \"ocean\" is not a feasible choice because it is not a specific location, but rather a general body of water."}

Bald eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, so it makes sense that they would be safest in a designated wildlife refuge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options - stressful, fun, illegal, and deadly - do not necessarily imply that accidents are involved. However, \"dangerous\" is directly related to accidents as dangerous driving behaviors, such as speeding or distracted driving, are often cited as common causes of accidents."}

The options \"living longer\" and \"illness\" are not likely, as they are contradictory or too broad. \"Tiredness\" may be a result of overeating, but it is not specific to dinner. \"Acid reflux\" may also be a consequence of overeating, but it is not always associated with dinner specifically. \"Stomach ache\" is the most likely option as it is a common consequence of overeating at dinner."}

Social bonding is a key reason for people to engage in conversations with friends. The other options may also be relevant in certain situations, but social bonding is the most common and likely motivation for chatting with friends."}

Where might he have been?"}}, "k": "street\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James was walking on a surface that was made hot by the sunshine. This is a common occurrence on streets or pavement, especially during the summer months when the sun is at its strongest.

California has experienced several severe droughts in recent years, so it is likely that this is where the fox was searching for water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Skiing is a physical activity that can strengthen muscles and improve cardiovascular health, which may contribute to overall wellness. The other options imply negative outcomes, such as injury or discomfort, which are not necessarily associated with successful skiing."}

This is commonly referred to as a hands-on demonstration. A demonstration often involves showing how to do something, rather than just telling or explaining it. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve teaching or showing how to do something."}

The other options (opera, water fountain, bus stop, church) do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to see people doing jumping jacks."}

Feeling safe is the primary purpose of a bodyguard, as they are hired to provide protection and security. The other options do not align with the purpose of a bodyguard or the context of the sentence."}

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?,"}}, "k": "frustration\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that making mistakes while learning a language can be uncomfortable, which will cause something negative. The word \"misinterpretation\" implies that the mistakes may lead to misunderstandings, which can be frustrating. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

What might the cops do to him?"}}, "k": "going to jail or going to prison\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim committed a crime that was serious enough to catch the attention of the police, which might lead to him being arrested and charged for his actions. Given the severity of his crime, it is likely that he would either be sentenced to jail or prison. Beating him up or killing him would not be a lawful response from the police. Get arrested is not a viable option, as Jim has already been arrested."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "129014ff081296c3d9bbc338c5ff32db", "question": {"question_concept": "fiddle", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "music store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "dance hall"}, {"label": "C", "text": "orchestra"}, {"label": "D", "text": "symphony"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tennessee"}], "stem": "Where is there usually a fiddle playing?"}}, "k": "dance hall\nKnowledge: The word \"fiddle\" is often associated with traditional folk music and is frequently played at social gatherings like dances. Therefore, the most likely answer would be a dance hall. While a fiddle may be found in a music store or used in an orchestra or symphony, the context of the question implies a more informal setting. The mention of Tennessee may be a red herring, as it could be a state known for country and folk music, but the other options are a better fit given the context of the question."}

The most common and effective way to address this is by getting adequate rest, which usually involves sleeping. While meditating can help with relaxation and stress reduction, it may not be sufficient to fully recover from exhaustion. Staying in bed without sleeping may not provide the necessary restorative benefits to fully recover, and running out of steam refers to reaching a point of complete exhaustion and collapse rather than a method of recovering from it."}

Applying for a job is a logical step towards acquiring a steady source of income. Standing in line, taking care of proposals, and passing courses may or may not lead to job opportunities, but they are not direct or guaranteed paths to earning money. Playing the lottery is a form of gambling that is not a reliable or sustainable way of earning money."}

Headaches are a common physical symptom associated with stress and tension, which someone who is grumpy may experience. The other options do not have the same clear association with being in a bad mood."}

Drugs can cause harm to the body, brain, and overall health. \"Cloud mind\" and \"lower I.Q.\" suggest more specific and immediate effects, while \"cause illness\" and \"cause accidents\" are potential consequences but not necessarily guaranteed. Therefore, \"damage\" is the safest and most accurate answer."}

However, their dam-building activities can also cause problems for human-made structures, particularly those that rely on water flow, such as a millpond. The other answer options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not likely to be affected by beaver activity."}

The other options are clearly negative or unrelated to the context of the sentence."}

Sunlight can be harmful to fungi, as it can dry them out and cause them to die. Therefore, it makes sense that a fungus would not want to grow in an area where it is constantly exposed to sunlight. Under rocks provides a naturally shaded and damp environment where a fungus could grow undisturbed. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for fungi to grow."}

The other options (\"boredom\", \"colds and flu\", \"taking tests\", \"spend time\") do not provide a valid reason for attending school."}

The mention of people playing the fiddle suggests a musical tradition, which is commonly associated with Tennessee and its famous country music scene. The other options are not states, nor do they have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Since the options refer to physical actions (such as stitching or pasting), the most appropriate answer is \"heal.\" This makes sense because emotional or psychological scars don't physically \"heal\" in the same way that a cut or wound might."}

Studies have shown that sex releases endorphins, which are feel-good hormones. This suggests that feeling good is a common result of sex. The other options are not necessarily always associated with sex. \"Making love\" is a euphemism for sex and does not describe a consequence. \"Happiness\" and \"wonderful thing\" are subjective and not supported by empirical evidence. \"Cloud judgment\" is not a common consequence of sex."}

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hole, television, and pool table do not involve people in uniform or playing with a ball, while a sporting goods store is not a place where people typically play sports. Therefore, the correct answer is \"sporting event.\""}

Seafood is typically associated with areas that have access to fresh seafood from the ocean, such as coastal cities. While New York City and Boston are both coastal cities, simply saying \"city\" is too broad and does not provide enough information to make an accurate guess."}

The word \"subordinate\" specifically refers to someone who is a lower-ranking member of an organization or company, which makes it the best choice among the given options. The other options, such as \"owner\" or \"foot,\" do not fit the context of someone in a position of authority yelling at someone else."}

The other choices are not applicable to the context of the sentence - \"hang up\" suggests a negative reaction, \"contact\" suggests initiating communication rather than responding to it, \"answer\" suggests a positive reaction but not necessarily to an offer, and \"attracting ducks\" is irrelevant."}

A mall typically has multiple store options, including fashion retailers and bookshops, making it the most likely location for the person to find what they are looking for. The other options are less likely to have a bookshop within close proximity to fashion stores."}

She continued to do what?"}}, "k": "gain weight \nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jamie's efforts to reduce her waist size were unsuccessful, which implies that her waist size may have increased or stayed the same. The words \"augment,\" \"dispare,\" \"make larger,\" and \"expand\" all imply an increase in size, while \"gain weight\" specifically applies to the context of trying to reduce one's waist size."}

He was frightened.  He didn't want this.  He was scared of what?"}}, "k": "coma\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James is experiencing a loss of consciousness, which is commonly associated with a coma. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. Death and loss of life would imply that James has already passed away, while peace and forgetfulness do not correspond with the fear and fright that James is expressing."}

If someone is aloof, they are not friendly or sociable. If someone is self-important, they have an inflated sense of their own importance and may not be interested in others. Therefore, it is likely that they would feel bored when meeting people, rather than feeling stressed, nervous, or making new friends. Smiling is also unlikely, as their demeanor suggests they do not have a desire to engage with others."}

A construction site is an area where workers are engaged in building or repairing buildings or other structures, making it the most likely choice. The other options (factory, engine, shops) do not have the same association with building or constructing, while the option \"insides of skyscraper's walls\" is too specific and unlikely to be the correct answer."}

The most logical option is \"fun\" because playing with your dog is typically an enjoyable and entertaining experience. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. \"Alive\" and \"health\" are not outcomes that would be expected from playing with a dog, and \"playing dead\" and \"black\" do not relate to the idea of playing with a dog at all."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a closet or a library of congress would not be practical places to keep a book while it is being read, and a classroom or desk would suggest that the reader is in a more formal or academic setting."}

The options classroom, backpack, and cabinet all refer to places where the student could potentially keep pencils, but none of them suggest that new pencils could be obtained from those locations. The option teacher also does not make sense, as the sentence does not indicate that the student would ask the teacher for new pencils. The best answer is store, as this is a common place to purchase new supplies such as pencils."}

The word \"driven\" implies an internal force or impulse that is guiding her behavior, which aligns with the concept of desire. The other options - money, time, credit, and spending money - do not fit as well because they are external factors that may influence shopping behavior but do not necessarily explain a strong drive to shop beyond practicality."}

Based on common experiences, getting paid is usually a positive experience that can bring satisfaction and relief. The other options, such as income tax and bill collectors, are typically negative aspects of financial transactions. The options \"ocean\" and \"to happy\" do not fit the context of the question. The option \"sorrow\" is unlikely to be associated with getting paid."}

The word \"unable\" fits this context and meaning. The other options either do not fit grammatically or do not make sense in the given context."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "d4ebade47b1e84ab403efc715a7ca991", "question": {"question_concept": "meat", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "backery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ham sandwich"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fridge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "butcher shop"}, {"label": "E", "text": "freezer"}], "stem": "Where can meat last a long time?"}}, "k": "freezer\nKnowledge: The question is asking where meat can last a long time, suggesting that the correct answer should be a place where meat can be stored for an extended period without going bad. The options \"bakery\" and \"ham sandwich\" are not places to store meat, so they can be eliminated. The option \"butcher shop\" may keep meat fresh for a short amount of time, but it is not a long-term storage solution. The options \"fridge\" and \"freezer\" are both places where meat can be stored, but the correct answer is likely \"freezer\" as it can preserve meat for a longer period of time than a fridge."}

A band typically refers to a group of musicians who play popular music, and while a cello could be included in a band, it is less common. The options \"ocean\", \"music store\", and \"music shop\" have no clear connection to the context of the question."}

While bees are attracted to flowers in general, the color red is particularly appealing to them. A trash can or honey do not seem like likely places for bees to congregate with red flowers, while a bouquet of flowers could contain red flowers but not necessarily attract bees. A rose garden could potentially have red flowers, but it is not specified whether or not bees are present. A field of flowers, however, is a likely place for bees to gather and pollinate."}

While it is possible that they may experience other negative consequences like falling down or vomiting, anger specifically implies aggression or violence. Additionally, research has shown a link between alcohol use and increased aggression. The other options do not necessarily relate to anger specifically."}

Knowledge is a more logical answer because listening is crucial in gaining understanding and learning new information. Empathy may be gained through listening, but it is not specifically mentioned in the sentence. Anxiety and falling down do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and \"hear things\" is too broad and does not provide any specific information."}

He had trouble telling it from what?"}}, "k": "reality\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Stanley had trouble distinguishing his dream from something else, which is commonly associated with confusing dreams with reality. The option \"reality\" is the most logical choice because if Stanley is having trouble telling his dream from reality, then it means that his dream was so vivid and realistic that it felt like it was actually happening. The other options either do not fit the context or do not make sense in the given sentence."}

Given that the other options (wasteland, ocean, desert, and flowers) do not logically fit with the idea of a community garden being demolished, the correct choice must be parking lot. This is a common reason for the destruction of public green spaces in urban areas, as developers often prioritize parking availability over community gardens or parks."}

The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence as well, as there's no indication of a dog or a garage, and \"nature\" is too broad and doesn't suggest any specific behavior. \"Floor\" is also too neutral and doesn't suggest any kind of trouble or destruction."}

When a person loses weight, they tend to have less strain on their joints and organs, which can lead to increased energy throughout the day. The other options are either negative (such as death) or not necessarily related to the benefits of losing weight (such as loose skin or beauty)."}

The other options do not make sense in this context - a demonstration and conference are events, a garage is a type of structure not typically meant for human habitation, and living in someone's mouth is not possible."}

The most likely place for a skin to be cut in this situation is on the finger, as this is the body part most commonly used when chopping food with a knife. The other options do not make sense in this context - \"good health\" and \"own family\" are not relevant to the situation, while \"meat\" and \"body\" do not fit with the sentence's use of the word \"skin\"."}

Both boredom and anger are mentioned as being not what they might feel, which leaves stress and anxiety as possible options. Since housework is often viewed as a chore and can be physically demanding, it is reasonable to expect that it might cause stress, which is a common response to demanding or challenging situations. Anxiety, on the other hand, is less likely to be the correct answer since it is not directly mentioned in the sentence."}

The fact that the accountant kept one at home suggests that they might also do work from home or sometimes need to do calculations outside of the office. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with work in accounting."}

The phrase \"present bill\" specifically refers to the action of bringing the receipt to the customer to indicate the total cost of the meal, which is a common practice in restaurants."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "e63b2dd1db7e1bd707956a41d3d2a83c", "question": {"question_concept": "glad", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "depressed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "downcast"}, {"label": "C", "text": "angry"}, {"label": "D", "text": "unhappy"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sorrowful"}], "stem": "If you aren't glad, unhappy or gloomy, what illness may you have?"}}, "k": "depressed\nKnowledge: The question is asking for a word that describes a state of being that is not glad, unhappy, or gloomy. Out of the choices given, only depressed fits that description. Depressed is often used to describe a state of low mood, lack of motivation, and general feeling of sadness. The other options all describe negative emotions that are similar to unhappiness or gloominess."}

The other options, such as going to church or appearing in court, do not necessarily guarantee that one will hear such testimony. Watching soap operas is unrelated to the topic of spirituality."}

Based on the choices, the option most closely associated with a temple is Jerusalem, a city known for its religious significance and for being the site of several ancient temples, including the Temple Mount. The other choices (Jewish community, middle east, city, mosque) do not specifically reference a famous temple."}

Since there are no large doors in the house, it is unlikely that the chair would be stored outside or in a garage. The most logical place to store the chair would be in a closet, which is a space that is designed specifically for storage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The other choices do not have any relevance to a discussion with a lawyer about divorce. \"Sisters\" refers to a familial relationship, while \"two people\" is too vague and could refer to any type of relationship. \"Marriage\" and \"lawyer\" are relevant to the context, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question."}

They are also capable of flying at high altitudes and speeds, which makes flying the most likely method of transportation referenced in the question.

This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what?"}}, "k": "hands\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John's hands were injured as a result of punching the wall, which will make it difficult for him to hold his tools. The other options (hostility, anger, nose, fists) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This is a common description of how dogs feel when they are in a small, enclosed space like a basket or a crate. The other options do not convey the same sense of being enclosed or restricted in space."}

Suicidal ideation may cause someone to feel overwhelmed, hopeless, or trapped, and they may consider ending their life as a way out of their pain. Overdosing, murder, and cyanide do not have a direct connection to depression, while sadness is a symptom of depression rather than a cause of death."}

The other choices may be relevant or important in other contexts, but do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "c4dcfeacbbc2d365a6fc34d8811e4ed6", "question": {"question_concept": "lizard", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "new mexico"}, {"label": "B", "text": "forrest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dessert"}, {"label": "D", "text": "garden"}, {"label": "E", "text": "creek"}], "stem": "Where would a lizard surprise a person?"}}, "k": "desert\nKnowledge: Lizards are often found in arid environments, such as deserts, where they can easily blend into their surroundings and surprise passersby. The other options may also have lizards, but the word \"surprise\" suggests that there is something unexpected about the location, which is more likely to be the case in a desert than in a forest or garden."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "64ce22ee28a83119363b83a83de1ae92", "question": {"question_concept": "food", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "picnic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "friend's house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "table"}, {"label": "D", "text": "space shuttle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fairgrounds"}], "stem": "They were getting together for the big game, he wasn't hosting but made sure to bring pretty of food with him over to where?"}}, "k": "friend's house\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that a group of people are gathering together to watch a sports game, and the person in question is making sure to bring plenty of food with them. The options \"picnic\" and \"fairgrounds\" do not seem like appropriate locations for watching a game, and \"space shuttle\" is completely unrelated. \"Table\" could be a possible location, but the fact that the person is bringing food with them implies that they are going to someone else's house. Therefore, \"friend's house\" is the most likely correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "46376ac886af06e85beac37f3391c357", "question": {"question_concept": "heart", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "person"}, {"label": "B", "text": "species"}, {"label": "C", "text": "artichoke"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all mammals"}, {"label": "E", "text": "live animal"}], "stem": "Who is likely yo have a caring heart?"}}, "k": "all mammals\nKnowledge: The phrase \"caring heart\" is often associated with empathy and compassion, which are traits commonly attributed to mammals. Mammals are animals that nurse their young and have a complex social structure that requires emotional connections between individuals. Therefore, it is likely that \"all mammals\" would be the correct choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to empathy or caring behavior."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "4bc34224aaa443baad6ccae86e11f3ab", "question": {"question_concept": "alcohol", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "pub"}, {"label": "B", "text": "plane"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fraternity house"}], "stem": "I'm looking for alcohol and fried foods, any suggestions?"}}, "k": "pub\nKnowledge: The keywords \"alcohol\" and \"fried foods\" suggest that the speaker is looking for a place to eat and drink with a casual atmosphere, which is commonly associated with pubs. Pubs often serve a range of alcoholic beverages such as beer and also offer fried foods like fish and chips or chicken wings. The other options such as plane, store, and fraternity house do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "9fd4737d024fb0d6a9f047bed295bddb", "question": {"question_concept": "jar", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "kitchen cupboard"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pantry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "grocery store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pantry"}, {"label": "E", "text": "refrigerator"}], "stem": "If I had a jar which was likely to spoil if left out, where would I want to put it?"}}, "k": "refrigerator\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the jar is likely to spoil if left out, which indicates that it requires a cool environment to maintain its freshness. The pantry and kitchen cupboard are typically warm and not suitable for preserving perishable items. The grocery store is not a proper storage option for an individual's jar. The refrigerator is the only option that provides the necessary cool environment to keep the jar from spoiling."}

Where was Sam?"}}, "k": "france\nKnowledge: The sentence explicitly states that Sam went to Paris, which is in France. The fact that he ordered a blowfish at a sushi place further contextualizes the location as France, as sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that is commonly served in French restaurants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "478a2734a41c208d54b79e165590c8d2", "question": {"question_concept": "skin", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "feel cold"}, {"label": "B", "text": "feel pressure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "feel bumpy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "itches"}, {"label": "E", "text": "feel clammy"}], "stem": "What will happen to skin pinched in something?"}}, "k": "feel pressure\nKnowledge: When skin is pinched in something, it will generally feel pressure due to the compression of the skin and underlying tissues. This pressure can cause discomfort or pain depending on the severity of the pinch. Feeling cold or clammy may be a result of external factors such as temperature or humidity, while feeling bumpy or itchy are unlikely sensations to arise from pinching alone."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "8f338dbffed1b6489297aeeace0e6388", "question": {"question_concept": "kite", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "child's hand"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the last straw"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hobby shop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "end of line"}, {"label": "E", "text": "toy store"}], "stem": "Sally lost her kite because she wasn't careful.  She thought that there was more string on the spool, but it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the what?."}}, "k": "end of line\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally lost her kite because the string ran out or reached the end of the line. This would explain why it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the end of the line. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "2060c15ad927d63db327f6277abee731", "question": {"question_concept": "grooming", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "looking good"}, {"label": "B", "text": "beauty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tardiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "handsomeness"}, {"label": "E", "text": "neatness"}], "stem": "The man uses grooming before a job interview, what is he trying to portray?"}}, "k": "neatness\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the man is preparing for a job interview, which typically requires a professional appearance. Grooming is an essential part of looking presentable and sending the right message to a potential employer. The other options, such as beauty and handsomeness, may not be as relevant or appropriate for a job interview setting. Tardiness is actually the opposite of what the man is trying to achieve by grooming, as it implies being late and disorganized."}

Synagogue is a place of worship for Jewish people, while confession is a confidential conversation between a person and a priest in Christianity. Both of them do not involve an audience sitting to listen to a religious speech. An office or an auditorium may have people sitting in chairs, but it is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is church."}

They are known to be affectionate and enjoy human interaction, making the home the most likely place for them to be happy. On the other hand, an alley or barn may be too dangerous or stressful for a pet cat, and a box or lap are not permanent homes."}

Denmark and California are not on the east coast of the United States, while \"map\" is not a geographical location. Therefore, the correct answer is the United States, which is where Florida is located on the east coast."}

This implies that without the right tools, a person may struggle to complete tasks effectively. The other options, such as persistence or becoming knowledgeable, may be helpful traits or activities, but they do not directly relate to the need for tools to work efficiently."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "6bdb0431fa12fbdc5d641044379eec7b", "question": {"question_concept": "launching platform", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "launch pad"}, {"label": "B", "text": "circus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "aircraft carrier"}, {"label": "D", "text": "large open area"}, {"label": "E", "text": "space station"}], "stem": "What is a mobile launching platform found in the ocean?"}}, "k": "aircraft carrier\nKnowledge: The question is asking for a specific type of platform found in the ocean, which rules out options like launch pad, circus, and space station, which are not typically found in the ocean. The option of \"large open area\" is too broad, and could describe any number of things found in the ocean. The correct answer is aircraft carrier, which is a type of ship designed to launch and recover military aircraft."}

The only option that fits this description is \"burlap sack,\" which is commonly used to store and transport potatoes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Research has shown that listening to music can increase dopamine levels in the brain, which can lead to feelings of happiness and pleasure. Music can also trigger the release of oxytocin, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress. Furthermore, music can stimulate the facial muscles, leading to smiles and positive facial expressions. Finally, music is often used as a form of entertainment, which can provide a sense of enjoyment and distraction from daily stressors."}

A bridge is a good option for throwing a rock because it provides a height advantage, allowing you to throw the rock from a higher position and generate more force upon impact. The other options, such as mountains, countryside, or the surface of the earth, do not offer the necessary height advantage to create a big splash in a river."}

Applause is a sign of approval and appreciation for a performance, and is often used to indicate a successful and entertaining show. None of the other options are commonly associated with a successful performance, and do not fit with the context of the sentence."}

They are often large stores that stock a wide variety of food items, making it a likely place for people to find food. The other options, such as opera, conference, building, and apartment, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely choices for the correct answer."}

Out of the choices given, only \"meet\" fits this context. \"Laugh\" and \"being entertained\" suggest that they are already playing or hanging out, while \"math\" has no clear relevance to the situation. \"Sit\" could be a possibility, but it doesn't capture the idea of actively preparing to go out and have fun."}

Therefore, \"knowledgable\" is the appropriate choice as it directly relates to one's level of education."}

Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he?"}}, "k": "prison\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Ben's mistake was significant enough to require him to spend 8 years somewhere as punishment. Given that he was described as an alcoholic, it's likely that his mistake involved drinking and driving, which is a serious offense that can result in a lengthy prison sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not seem like appropriate places for someone who committed a serious crime."}

The option world cup refers to a specific tournament, rather than a location. Therefore, the correct answer is outside, indicating that the field is located in an open-air setting."}

Therefore, options such as \"mail box\" and \"post office\" are not correct, as these refer to places where letters are dropped off or picked up, rather than delivered directly to the recipient. \"Suitcase\" and \"bowl\" are also unlikely options, as they are not commonly used for delivering letters. \"Front door\" is a logical choice, as it is where most deliveries, including letters, are typically made."}

Sam didn't like company.  He prefered what?"}}, "k": "solitude\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam does not like having others around him and prefers to be alone. The most fitting choice would be solitude, which refers to being alone in a calm and peaceful manner. The other options, such as abbreviation and you, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. Loneliness is related to being alone, but it has a negative connotation, which does not fit the context of the sentence."}

The most likely places for them to have more than one fan would be at home or in a hot room. The hardware store and office options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest a personal preference for cool temperatures."}

This could be due to fear or some other reason. The options \"injury\" and \"death\" are unlikely because the person is still falling through the air, and there is no evidence of physical harm. \"Playing uno\" is unrelated and a non sequitur. \"Falling down\" is incorrect because the person is already falling, and this option does not explain how the person could become unconscious. \"Coma\" is the best option because it suggests that the person may have some medical or psychological issue that is causing them to become unconscious while skydiving."}

The other choices are more specific and do not necessarily apply to all instances of seeing something through an eyepiece. \"Sights\" is the most general option that fits the context of the question."}

The word \"horrible\" has a negative connotation and can be used to describe something that is frightening or awful, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The term \"school grade\" is commonly used to refer to the letter grade that a student receives on an assignment or for their overall performance in a class. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to test performance or grading."}

The option \"work\" fits this context the best because it is the opposite of being bored and is associated with being productive in a job environment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Insect repellent is not a result of jogging, while heart attacks and shin splints are negative effects that can occur if one does not exercise safely or appropriately. Being tired is a common feeling after exercising, but it is not necessarily a desirable result. Therefore, improved health is the correct answer."}

This is a common woodworking technique that is used for furniture, construction, and many other applications. Carving involves removing material from the wood to create a specific shape or design, polishing involves making the wood smooth and shiny, petrification involves turning the wood into stone, and eating cake has nothing to do with woodworking. Therefore, nailed is the correct answer."}

The word \"formal\" in front of \"dining room\" implies that the space in question is specifically designated for formal events, such as dinner parties or holiday gatherings, which makes it the most appropriate location for a new dining table. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question."}

The phrase \"so negligible\" indicates that inflation is not noticeable or important in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the idea of inflation being insignificant or not noticeable."}

A carpenter's shop, garage, and video game are all unlikely to have multiple floors, while the total number is not a thing that can have levels. Therefore, building is the most logical option as buildings commonly have multiple levels, particularly in urban areas where space is limited."}

Given the high risks associated with hospitals, they are required to have fire extinguishers in many locations throughout the facility to ensure that the staff can respond to fires quickly and effectively. The other options do not have the same level of potential risk or regulations that would require many fire extinguishers."}

Learning to play piano often involves guided instruction which can be obtained through a music class although the other options may also provide access to an upright piano. A music room or house may have an upright piano but may not necessarily provide instruction. A music store may sell upright pianos but not necessarily offer lessons. \"Medium\" does not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Of the choices given, exposure, study, and thought may all be helpful in the learning process, but cooperation suggests that the person is not learning alone. Patience, on the other hand, is important because learning by oneself can be a slow process that requires persistence and endurance."}

They were dating for a while and wanted to be together for even longer. For this reason, they did what?"}}, "k": "plan to marry\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that John and Jane wanted to be together for a longer time, which suggests that they were considering a long-term commitment. The most common long-term commitment in a romantic relationship is marriage, so it makes sense that they would plan to marry. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the couple's desire for a long-term commitment."}

The other options are not commonly associated with getting paid. Sorrow is unlikely as getting paid is usually seen as a positive thing. Paying bills and frustration are associated with financial responsibility and management, but they do not describe the emotional response to getting paid specifically. Spending money is a consequence of getting paid, but it is not the emotion itself."}

The option \"food\" makes the most sense as the purpose of a market is usually to sell food and other goods. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Stress\" and \"spending money\" may be related to going to a market, but they are not as directly connected as the option \"food.\" \"That you\" and \"walking\" are not relevant to the question."}

Towed and accidents are possible consequences, but they are not a direct result of not moving the car. Driving and getting tired are not consequences of not moving the car at all."}

I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run?"}}, "k": "city block\nKnowledge: The sentence provides specific details about Bob running from a corner store to his home, indicating that he ran along a specific path. The option \"city block\" best describes a specific area of a town or city and would be most likely to refer to the distance that Bob ran. The other options do not accurately describe a specific area or distance. \"Bed of nails\" and \"attractive consistent look\" are unrelated to the context of the sentence, and \"ground\" is too broad to accurately describe a specific path."}

High school bands are often known for being less experienced and polished than professional orchestras and symphonies, which may lead to a less pleasing sound. The other options, such as orchestra and symphony, are typically groups that consist of professional musicians who are skilled in playing their instruments with a pleasing sound. The phrase \"baritone woodwind sound\" is not specific enough to provide a clear answer, and \"play music\" is too broad and vague to be a relevant option."}

He liked being about to divide people into what categories?"}}, "k": "winners and losers\nKnowledge: The sentence explicitly states that John is competitive and loved competing. This implies that he enjoyed comparing himself to others and determining who was better than whom. The phrase \"divide people into categories\" suggests that John liked to categorize people based on their performance in competitions. The options \"perform better\", \"might win\", \"losses\", and \"enemies\" do not fit the context of the sentence as closely as \"winners and losers\"."}

I got it then because it was usually what?"}}, "k": "overpriced\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the game was on sale, indicating that it was previously more expensive than its current price. The phrase \"overpriced\" implies that the original price was too high, which is why the game was discounted. The other options do not provide a reason for why the game was on sale or why the speaker decided to buy it at that time."}

The word \"massive\" suggests that the building has a significant size or weight, which makes \"massless\" a poor choice. \"Dwarf\" and \"inconsequential\" both suggest that the building is small or unimportant, which contradicts the fact that the building is described as \"massive.\" \"Good\" is not an option because the sentence explicitly states that the building is not constructed well. Therefore, \"insubstantial\" is the most appropriate option as it implies that the building is not solid or substantial due to poor construction."}

Print shops are businesses that specialize in printing services and typically handle large volumes of printing tasks for a diverse range of clients. Schools and home offices may have printers, but they likely do not serve thousands of people. A people store is not a commonly used term, and a newspaper office may have a printer, but its use would likely be limited to employees."}

The other answer choices do not relate to the concept of financial constraints and therefore are not correct in the context of the question."}

However, the use of the phrase \"moved out of the city\" suggests that they were looking for a suburban home rather than a large or old house, which could be located in various areas. The option \"keeping personal objects\" is not related to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not have a clear connection to adding a line. A bus stop typically already has lines marking where people should stand, and adding another line would not be necessary. A post office would not typically require adding a line unless it was for some specific purpose. Adding a line to grass or a play activity does not make sense in the context of the question."}

He thought it would look good in what part of his home?"}}, "k": "family room\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that Joe bought a ficus, which is typically a type of indoor houseplant. Since the other options do not correspond to indoor areas of a home, it is reasonable to assume that Joe intended to place the ficus in a room within his house. The term \"family room\" is often used to refer to a casual living space within a home, where people gather to watch television or spend time together. Therefore, it is the most appropriate choice."}

This is a common motivation for discussing new information with others, as it allows individuals to deepen their understanding of the subject and gain new insights. The other options, such as agreement, discomfort, and misunderstanding, do not provide a clear explanation for why people would continue talking in this scenario. To fill their time may be a motivation for some people, but it is not specifically related to the context of discovering new information while chatting with friends."}

The option \"increased knowledge\" is a possible answer, but it does not reflect a specific change in view. \"Appreciation of nature\" may be a potential outcome of learning about science, but it does not fully capture the range of possible changes in perspective. \"Become educated\" and \"excitement\" may indeed result from learning about science, but they do not address the question of how one's views may change. \"See things differently\" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how learning about science can alter one's outlook or understanding of the world."}

Disorientation can occur when a person loses their sense of direction or becomes confused about where they are. This is particularly dangerous when diving because it can lead to getting lost or running out of air. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

However, the most common place for pedestrians to stand at an intersection is on the street corner or sidewalk. This is because it offers a safe place to wait for the traffic to clear, and it also provides a view of the traffic flow from all directions. The other options, such as cars or at a red light, are not typical places for pedestrians to stand at an intersection."}

Since the answer choices are all location-related, it can be assumed that the factor affecting traffic is the proximity to a certain location. The most likely answer is an American city, as expressways are commonly found in urban areas and experience higher levels of traffic as you approach the city center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The options given are gas stations, city, London, train station, and airport. Gas stations are unlikely to have many telephone booths as people tend to use their cell phones for emergencies. London may have a large number of telephone booths, but it is unclear if it has more than other options. Train stations and airports may have telephone booths, but their numbers may be limited. Therefore, the best answer is city, as cities typically have more telephone booths scattered throughout their streets and public areas."}

He was a bit upset that he had to do it, but he needed the job.  Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what?"}}, "k": "closer\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that John moved away from his family for a job, and even though he needed the job, he was a bit upset about the move. This implies that he would have preferred a job that was closer to his family so he would not have to move away. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

Where might she look for one?"}}, "k": "music shop\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Alexa needs to switch from an electric guitar to an acoustic guitar to avoid disturbing her housemate James while he works. To find an acoustic guitar, she would be best served by going to a music shop, which stocks a variety of guitars and other musical instruments for sale. The other options (house, storage, closet) are unlikely to yield any new guitars and the studio may or may not have guitars for sale."}

Out of the given choices, \"smiles\" is the most appropriate as it is a common physical expression of happiness. The other options could potentially be associated with happiness in some contexts, but they do not directly answer the question as asked. For example, \"love\" could be a source of happiness for some people, but it does not necessarily cause someone feeling happiness to fall into it."}

Therefore, it is logical to assume that the chef is cooking dinner. The other options may be things a chef does in general, but they do not specifically relate to working in the evening."}

Feeling angry is a common response to being robbed, as it is a violation of one's personal space and belongings. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or offer any plausible consequences of having one's money stolen."}

Brainstorming is a common technique used in group settings to encourage free-flowing ideas without judgment or evaluation. The other options do not relate to the concept of coming up with new ideas or brainstorming."}

Mortal refers to anything that is subject to death, decay, or destruction, whereas the other options all directly refer to the act or state of dying. Therefore, mortal is the best fit for the sentence as it describes the overarching quality of the subject rather than a specific moment in time."}

The only answer that suggests a possible solution to this problem is \"getting good grades,\" as this would make the mother happy and potentially alleviate the need for housework. The other options do not offer any clear way to prevent the punishment."}

The other options are not as commonly used for transportation. A helicopter is a luxury form of transportation and not accessible to most people. Speaking words, believing in God, and dancing together are not modes of transportation but rather abilities, beliefs, and activities."}

A rest area is a common location along highways where travelers can stop to rest and use facilities, and they often have large areas with pavement or gravel that would not have grass. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - a supermarket would not be a place to collect items to sell at a roadside stand, a state park and a garden are unlikely to have areas with no grass, and the surface of the earth is too broad and vague to be a useful option."}

The option \"end of line\" is also unlikely to be the correct answer because it does not make sense in the context of fish and backyards. The option \"ocean\" is repeated twice, which shows that it is likely a mistake or a distraction."}

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is \"communicating with others,\" which is the basic function of talking to someone."}

It is typically used by professional hairstylists in places such as hair salons or beauty parlors. The other options, such as \"hair of woman\" or \"woman's hair\" are not likely places of work, while a pincushion is a sewing tool and a barber shop typically specializes in men's haircuts."}

{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "41e688b8ec1b507dbb8f8b37b40f26e6", "question": {"question_concept": "watching television", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "getting fat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "get fat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "typing words"}, {"label": "D", "text": "falling asleep"}, {"label": "E", "text": "wasted time"}], "stem": "If your watching television and accomplish nothing what have you done?"}}, "k": "wasted time\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that watching television without accomplishing anything is a negative consequence. \"Wasted time\" is a commonly used phrase to describe an unproductive use of time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. \"Getting/get fat\" may be a result of watching too much television if it interferes with exercise or healthy eating habits, but it is not directly stated in the sentence. \"Typing words\" is not related to the activity of watching television. \"Falling asleep\" may occur while watching television, but it is not a consequence of accomplishing nothing."}

The fox is most likely to have been outside, as it is a wild animal that lives in natural habitats such as forests and meadows. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no mention of a location like Indiana or England, a wall or a picture."}

The other options (\"names\", \"words\", \"naval\", \"bladders\") are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not help in choosing the correct answer."}

The word \"sharp\" implies intelligence and competence, but the phrase \"when it came to the details\" suggests a specific weakness. The word \"inaccurate\" indicates that the engineer made mistakes in his calculations, which is a common problem when details are overlooked or not given sufficient attention. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The options \"cook dinner\" and \"make bread\" are unlikely, as these activities typically take more time and are associated with preparing meals later in the day. \"Eating in a restaurant\" is a possibility, but the phrase \"because of being hungry\" suggests that the person is looking for a quick and easy meal, which is more likely to be found at home or in a casual dining setting. \"Having lunch\" is the most appropriate choice as it fits both the context and the expectation that someone would eat a meal in the middle of the day."}

He wanted to spend more time there, so that he could study the exhibits more.   He was a very academic person and loved doing what?"}}, "k": "gaining knowledge\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John is an academic person who enjoys learning and studying. This is evidenced by his desire to spend more time at the museum in order to learn more about the exhibits. The other options are not consistent with John's character or interests."}

Telling many people about such a situation is likely to result in the situation becoming more widely known, which is what the word \"notoriety\" suggests. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

These options provide a tight seal that can preserve the freshness of the product and protect it from oxidation. Supermarkets are primarily places where peanut butter can be purchased, not stored. A pantry or sandwich are places where peanut butter can be consumed, not stored."}

The other options (\"toy store,\" \"school,\" \"toy shop,\" and \"shelf\") are unlikely because they are not commonly used for playing board games with family."}

While it's possible that James spent a lot of money on a bike or tool storage, the fact that he needs a garage implies that he needs space to store something larger or more valuable. Additionally, the mention of \"spending a lot of money\" suggests that the item in question is likely to be expensive, like a car."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "1c57cabf4fa376748e7474ced6243e50", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "cross street"}, {"label": "B", "text": "stand upright"}, {"label": "C", "text": "speak spanish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "speak chinese"}, {"label": "E", "text": "further education"}], "stem": "If I am a person, I have a unique ability to do what?"}}, "k": "stand upright\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person referred to in the question has a unique ability that differentiates them from other things or beings. Among the choices given, only standing upright can be considered a unique ability that only a person possesses. The other options are either common to many other things (crossing the street) or can be learned by anyone (speaking Spanish or Chinese, furthering education)."}

Going to a wedding or a restaurant can be noisy and crowded, while going to a friend's house or an internet cafe may not necessarily be a quiet activity. Therefore, the best answer is likely \"movie.\""}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "af602ff4c6b62274a6ee77fc4469d033", "question": {"question_concept": "animals", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "bite"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lie down"}, {"label": "C", "text": "keep alive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "need to eat"}, {"label": "E", "text": "go to sleep"}], "stem": "If an animal is tired, what is it likely to do?"}}, "k": "go to sleep\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the animal is tired, which is commonly associated with the need for rest or sleep. It is unlikely that a tired animal would bite, and keeping alive and needing to eat are basic functions that are unrelated to the animal's state of exhaustion. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely to be \"go to sleep\" or \"lie down\" because they are actions that an animal would typically take if it is tired."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "111d65fa327038cc38c2f3048975fced", "question": {"question_concept": "chairs", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "bookstore"}, {"label": "B", "text": "house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "race track"}, {"label": "D", "text": "friend's house"}, {"label": "E", "text": "building"}], "stem": "Where would you sit in a chair to watch four-legged animals complete?"}}, "k": "race track\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to watching four-legged animals complete, which is likely a reference to horse races or dog races. In this case, the most appropriate location to watch this activity is at a race track. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "dd1f94d7288ed696f2d83b04abbf27a7", "question": {"question_concept": "lemur", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "russia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "at home"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hole"}, {"label": "D", "text": "field"}, {"label": "E", "text": "heaven"}], "stem": "If you were looking for a lemur where would you find it?"}}, "k": "at home\nKnowledge: Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar and can also be found on the nearby Comoros Islands. Therefore, it would be unlikely to find a lemur in Russia, a hole, a field or heaven. The only option that makes sense is that a lemur would be found at home, which would be their natural habitat in Madagascar."}

Where did  he go to get more?"}}, "k": "office depot\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John needed to go somewhere to obtain more pencils. The options \"desk drawer,\" \"cup,\" and \"pencil case\" are locations where John may have kept pencils, but it is unlikely he would need to go anywhere to obtain more. \"Shelf\" is too vague to determine if it is a location for pencils or a possible store. \"Office Depot\" is a store that sells office supplies, including pencils, so it is the most logical choice for where John went to get more pencils."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "4595eae0857e01310adf19cbc138ea7c", "question": {"question_concept": "wood", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "burned"}, {"label": "B", "text": "polished"}, {"label": "C", "text": "carved"}, {"label": "D", "text": "composted"}, {"label": "E", "text": "nailed"}], "stem": "When would you be able to see your reflection in a piece of wood?"}}, "k": "polished\nKnowledge: The only choice in the list that involves making a piece of wood reflective is polishing. Burning, carving, composting, and nailing all involve altering the wood in ways that would not create a reflective surface. Therefore, the correct answer must be \"polished.\""}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "3fef24d7a9fb1277e34a9f974ff224c7", "question": {"question_concept": "expressing yourself", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "communication"}, {"label": "B", "text": "suffering"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "laughter"}, {"label": "E", "text": "embarrassment"}], "stem": "What emotion do people expressing themselves show when they trip in front of a crowd and break their leg?"}}, "k": "embarrassment\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the people in question are expressing themselves, which indicates that they are conveying some kind of message or emotion through their actions. The fact that they trip and break their leg in front of a crowd suggests that their message or emotion is related to that situation. Suffering and pain could be possible emotions in this scenario, but the phrase \"people expressing themselves\" doesn't strongly suggest those emotions specifically. Laughter seems unlikely, given that breaking a leg is a serious and painful injury. Embarrassment, on the other hand, makes sense given the social awkwardness and potential humiliation of stumbling and falling in public."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "b2e81809ec3b362fe74ee3ffcabcfdb2", "question": {"question_concept": "squash court", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "country club"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rich person's house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pool"}, {"label": "D", "text": "park"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fitness center"}], "stem": "He waited for his friend at the squash court, but he was worried his friend thought he meant the at the other end of the public what?"}}, "k": "fitness center\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is waiting for their friend at a public location, specifically a fitness center with a squash court. The other options, such as a country club or rich person's house, imply a location that would not be open to the public or would not have a squash court readily available. A pool or park may be public locations, but they do not have a clear connection to squash or waiting for someone at a specific spot."}

The other options do not fit this category - \"flower\" and \"flower petals\" are not typically eaten, and \"animal\" and \"alive\" are not plants at all."}

However, the question specifically asks for a location that is likely to be outdoors. Parks are a common location for outdoor basketball courts, as they provide ample open space for the court and allow for easy public access. The other options do not necessarily indicate an outdoor location."}

It is unlikely that an artist would have any use for it, and it would not be found in a junkyard. While it could be used in singing or in an orchestra, a music store would be the most likely place to buy or rent a balalaika."}

Victorian houses are a type of older house and may have attics filled with historical items, but not all Victorian houses have attics filled with historical items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Four out of the five choices are states, but the question specifies that the city name is \"popular,\" implying that it is a commonly known city. Mississippi is likely the correct answer as it is a well-known state with a capital city named Jackson that houses the governor's office. The other state options may have cities named Jackson, but they are not typically associated with a prominent governor's office."}

It is commonly used in a recording studio where an artist or band would record an album. A radio station or TV studio might also use a microphone boom, but they are more likely to use stationary microphones instead. A concert setting could also use a microphone boom, but it wouldn't be used specifically for recording an album, as live performances are usually recorded with multiple stationary microphones. New York is not relevant to the context and does not provide any useful information for answering the question."}

Cause death is the most extreme and severe outcome of an injury. Bleeding, falling down, becoming infected, and claiming insurance are all possible consequences of an injury, but they are not necessarily the worst outcome."}

The only option among the choices that fits this context is \"sitting down.\" The other options do not relate to what people may be doing on a bus such as \"refusing\" or \"going outdoors.\" \"Save money\" is also not likely to be a reason why all the seats on a bus are full."}

They were really what?"}}, "k": "rare\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob had undervalued his Pokemon cards, but that he was mistaken. The word \"common\" implies that Bob believed the cards were not special or unique, but the phrase \"but he was wrong about them\" implies that they were actually in some way exceptional. The word \"rare\" means something that is not common or is unusual, which fits with the idea that Bob's cards were more valuable than he had believed. The other options do not strongly suggest that the cards were more valuable than Bob had assumed."}

The word \"even\" suggests that the husband's emotions may be complex and not focused solely on his relationship with his wife. The other options, such as happiness and pleasure, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not likely to be appropriate emotional responses to the end of a marriage. Isolation may be a possible secondary emotion, but it is not the primary emotion suggested in the sentence."}

The only option that fits this description is Canada, as it shares a border with the USA and is a commonly imported source of apples. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The phrase \"simply just to do\" implies that the purpose of the activity was not to achieve a specific goal or outcome, but rather to occupy his time. The option \"mentally challenged\" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it implies a difficulty or struggle, which is not suggested by the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "4cfd8cde494308c8398b5c098fab7513", "question": {"question_concept": "learning", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "interesting"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "joyful or painful"}, {"label": "D", "text": "very important"}, {"label": "E", "text": "free"}], "stem": "What would you change the learning process to be if someone does not like learning?"}}, "k": "interesting, fun, joyful \nKnowledge: The question suggests that someone does not like learning, so changing the learning process is necessary. The answer choices \"interesting, fun, joyful\" imply that the learning process should be engaging and enjoyable, rather than boring or unpleasant. The option \"very important\" may not necessarily address the issue of someone not liking learning. The option \"free\" relates more to cost rather than the actual learning process."}

Of the choices provided, \"patience\" stands out as the most relevant quality for this purpose. Teaching children can be a challenging and often frustrating task, so it requires a great deal of patience to ensure that they understand the material and remain engaged in the learning process. The other options, such as \"boredom\" and \"inspiration\", do not make sense in the given context."}

The choice \"satisfaction\" could be inferred from the fact that an owner would feel satisfied or happy after successfully grooming their pet's nails without causing any harm. The other options do not appear to fit the context of the sentence, as training and beauty may not necessarily have a direct connection to the action of grooming nails, late may not make sense in context, and injury would be a negative consequence."}

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - \"ruined\" and \"sadness\" are negative outcomes that the man would not be actively seeking, and \"clean clothes\" and \"look better\" are too general to accurately capture the specific goal indicated by the sentence."}

The option \"go on vacation\" is the most relevant and logical choice, whereas the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence."}

Lotion is commonly used to moisturize and hydrate skin, which can make it feel smoother and softer. The other options do not make sense in the context of applying lotion."}

The word \"assuming that you don't spill anything\" implies that the experience can be enjoyable if done correctly. The options \"vomiting\" and \"mess\" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence. \"Happiness\" and \"contentment\" have positive connotations, but \"pleasure\" is a more specific and fitting description for the experience of indulging in breakfast in bed."}

Therefore, the correct answer would be \"dress himself.\" The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are not appropriate actions for someone getting ready for work."}

Illinois, New York, and Indiana are all states that have wooded areas, but the word \"woods\" specifically refers to a dense forest or wooded area, making it the most appropriate choice."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "24bb2394b6bd778b607ca923aee8e994", "question": {"question_concept": "dictionary", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "shelf"}, {"label": "B", "text": "library"}, {"label": "C", "text": "classroom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "table"}, {"label": "E", "text": "desk"}], "stem": "Mom is tidying a house, where would she put the loose dictionary?"}}, "k": "shelf\nKnowledge: The dictionary is a book and therefore normally belongs on a shelf. A library or classroom might also have a suitable shelf, but the context of the sentence suggests that Mom is cleaning a personal household rather than a public space. The table and desk are possible options, but they are not as suitable as a shelf for long-term storage and organization of a dictionary."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "be24e81e1761b422038365cd06e82edd", "question": {"question_concept": "passing sentence", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "go to jail"}, {"label": "B", "text": "incarceration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "intercourse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "death"}, {"label": "E", "text": "judgement"}], "stem": "The judge did not take this part of the job lightly, the man was guilty but it was his passing sentence that condemned the man to what?"}}, "k": "death\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge played a significant role in the man's ultimate fate, indicating that this decision was crucial. The context implies that the severity of the sentence was what condemned the man, and the option \"death\" is the most severe punishment that a judge can impose. The other options, such as \"go to jail\" or \"incarceration,\" may be significant penalties but do not match the severity implied in the sentence. \"Intercourse\" and \"judgement\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow?"}}, "k": "dairy farm\nKnowledge: Simon bought the cow for work, not for meat, which suggests that he plans to use it for a purpose other than being sold for slaughter. Taking the cow to a butcher shop would contradict this purpose, as it implies that Simon is interested in obtaining meat from the animal. The countryside or city options do not provide any insight as to where Simon might be taking the cow, as both locations could be home to various types of farms or businesses. Canada, while a possible location, is not hinted at by the context of the sentence. The most likely option is a dairy farm, as cows are commonly used for their milk in such establishments."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "621d52d498adeb41ecb372b53b0fcaa1", "question": {"question_concept": "children", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "walk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "change shoes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "play tag"}, {"label": "D", "text": "smell smoke"}, {"label": "E", "text": "reach over"}], "stem": "What would children do if they are bored?"}}, "k": "play tag\nKnowledge: The word \"bored\" suggests that the children are looking for something to do to alleviate their boredom. Playing tag is a common activity for children that is both fun and active, making it a likely choice for children looking to pass the time. Walking and changing shoes are not typically activities that children will choose to do to alleviate boredom, while smelling smoke and reaching over have no clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "2c1f36267c3663cd1bb22e33f297be1b", "question": {"question_concept": "canned goods", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "cabinet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pantry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "kitchen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "cupboard"}, {"label": "E", "text": "shelf"}], "stem": "Behind what small door are canned goods usually kept in?"}}, "k": "pantry\nKnowledge: Canned goods are typically stored in a pantry, which is a small room or closet used for storing food or household items. A pantry is designated specifically for food storage and is often a separate room or space from the kitchen. The other options may also be used for storing canned goods, but they are not as commonly associated with canned goods as the pantry."}

The word \"massage\" suggests a relaxing experience, which would likely bring someone pleasure. The other options, such as depression or nostalgia, do not fit the context of a positive memory."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "fcd70a597379ac881085a01e342ad14d", "question": {"question_concept": "department store", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "idaho"}, {"label": "B", "text": "shopping mall"}, {"label": "C", "text": "big city"}, {"label": "D", "text": "in town"}, {"label": "E", "text": "new york"}], "stem": "If I want to maximize my number of potential customers, where should I build a new department store?"}}, "k": "big city\nKnowledge: Since the question is asking about maximizing potential customers, it is logical to choose a location with a larger population to draw from. A big city would have more potential customers than a small town or even a shopping mall. While New York is a big city, the answer does not necessarily have to be that specific and could apply to any big city. The other options, such as Idaho or a shopping mall, would likely limit the number of potential customers."}

A ball is typically a toy, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that a toy store would have a wide variety of balls available for purchase. The kitchen, child's hand, and street are unlikely places to find a ball, and while a soccer game is a possible location, it is not necessarily a good place to get a ball if one is not already in possession of one."}

Coal or wood are fuel sources that can be burned to create a fire, but they are not the actual chemical reaction. Lava is a type of molten rock and not a chemical reaction. A house and solar energy are not related to the question at all."}

Unlike a cash drawer or purse, piggy banks do not have an easy opening or access point, while boxes and pockets are usually not specifically designed for holding money."}

Checking the menu would be the easiest way to find out if the restaurant serves milk. The other choices, such as asking the waitress or checking the accompaniment to the meal, may not always provide accurate information. Cafeterias and home are not related to the context of the question."}

Classrooms are commonly associated with a specific number of students and are designed to accommodate a limited number of people at a time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

When the fighting started, he only saw what sort of things?"}}, "k": "battlefield\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John joined the army with the intention of traveling and exploring new places, but when the fighting started, he only saw a specific type of scenery. The most likely option is the battlefield, as it is where soldiers typically fight in wars. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not imply that John would have seen them during his service."}

The toy store, bar, and casino are unlikely places for children to play games, while the table is too generic to be a specific location for playing games. The family room, on the other hand, is a commonly known location where families gather and play games together."}

Automobile accidents and car crashes often result in physical pain and injury, while backache and eye strain can cause discomfort and pain. The only option that does not involve pain is getting tired, which is a common experience for drivers who have been on the road for long periods of time."}

A cupboard is a small, enclosed space that is usually kept closed, making it unlikely that many people have been breathing the air inside. The train station, house, and cricket stadium are all large spaces with a lot of people passing through, making it more likely that the air has been breathed by many people. The surface of the earth is a vast area where air is constantly being circulated and exchanged, making it unlikely that the air in any one place has been breathed by only a few people recently."}

When a company goes bankrupt, it may file for bankruptcy protection or be forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. In most cases, the company's assets are liquidated or sold to pay off its debts. This process is called liquidation. The other choices do not accurately describe the outcome of bankruptcy. \"Own resources\" and \"branch out\" suggest that the company may recover on its own, while \"commit crime\" is not a legal outcome of bankruptcy, and \"game over\" is too vague to be a correct answer."}

Soccer is a sport that meets both of these criteria, as it is played without the use of hands and physical contact that could cause blood to be spilled is generally discouraged.

The options \"building,\" \"friend's house,\" and \"classroom\" are too general and do not provide any contextual clues related to the sentence. The option \"window\" is already mentioned in the sentence and would not make sense as the answer. Therefore, \"front door\" is the most logical choice as it is directly related to the context of the sentence."}

A bus stop is a common place where people wait in line to catch a bus, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the image of people lined up next to a sign."}

This is  is a position on what?"}}, "k": "symphony orchestra\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that John has achieved a prestigious position, which is likely to be related to professional violin playing. First violin is typically a position in a symphony orchestra, where the first violinist leads and coordinates the other violinists in the orchestra. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general or not related to professional violin playing."}

The options \"jar\" and \"stick to fingers\" do not make sense in this context, while \"farmer's market\" could be a possible answer as they often sell locally sourced products including honey. However, the best answer is \"beehive\" as that is where honey is produced and harvested directly from the apiary."}

It usually contains important documents or work-related items, which is why it would make the most sense to bring it to a business meeting. The other options do not align with the professional connotations of an attache case. Bringing it to a hospital or in a shirt, for example, would not make much sense contextually. The overhead compartment and chair options are both possible, but less likely since they do not reflect the purpose or context of the attache case."}

The question asks why books have chapters on the back, suggesting that the answer will involve knowledge about the purpose of book chapters. Chapters in a book are typically used to organize the content and make it easier for readers to navigate and find specific information. Therefore, the correct answer is \"read book\". The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence."}

Happiness is the most likely option as it is the opposite of sadness and anger, and matches the description of the family being \"full of joy.\" Amusement is also a possibility but may not fully capture the intensity of the joy described in the sentence. Losing money and anger are not consistent with the positive tone of the sentence."}

Where might he go?"}}, "k": "neighbor's house\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that Jimmy cannot drink in his own home because his wife is an alcoholic on probation. Therefore, he may go to his neighbor's house to drink instead. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

The options of police station and classroom are unlikely as glue is not a common material used in those settings. Desk drawer is too specific and not a location where many glue bottles would be stored. School is too broad and does not offer any specificity to the question. This leaves the art room as the most likely answer, as glue is a common material used in art projects."}

The throne room is a common location for important meetings and events in monarchies, and is often the designated space for welcoming important guests and conducting official business. The other options do not have the same level of significance or formality as the throne room in this context."}

However, the use of the word \"kids\" and the lack of mention of any organized teams or games makes the street option the most likely correct answer. Playing with balls on the street is a common activity for kids, and concrete is a commonly used surface for playing with small balls like bouncy balls or handballs. The other options do not fit with the context of the question."}

The other options (exhilaration, dismemberment, spinal injuries, and getting wet) do not fit the comedic tone implied by the sentence."}

It seemed like the guys there did nothing but what?"}}, "k": "getting drunk\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jimmy did not enjoy the atmosphere of the party. The phrase \"did nothing but\" indicates that the guys at the party were engaged in a repeated or continuous behavior. Of the given choices, \"getting drunk\" is the most likely behavior to elicit a negative reaction from someone who does not enjoy that kind of activity. The other options, such as dancing or meeting new people, do not necessarily imply negative feelings."}

When a family expands, they may require more space in their home to accommodate everyone's needs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they all relate to personal growth or relationships rather than practical needs for a growing family."}

Botanical gardens and arboretums are both places where one might find a special ficus, as they are locations dedicated to the cultivation and display of plants. A doctor's office or public place would be less likely to have a special ficus, and \"in a sea\" does not make sense in the context of the question."}

He knows that it will be a good fit and he has experience, but he doesn't have all the qualifications that they're asking for, so he's worried about what?"}}, "k": "rejection\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James is concerned about not having all the qualifications that the job requires, which could make him less likely to be accepted or hired.

Shuddering can be a symptom of a serious medical condition, such as a stroke or seizure, which could potentially threaten one's life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other answer choices (pointed, bright, acute angled) do not have a clear connection to the definition of \"obtuse\" and are therefore unlikely to be correct."}

Mail orders allow customers to purchase products remotely and have them shipped to their preferred address, which can be more convenient than going to a physical store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as heart attacks or fatigue, are negative outcomes that are not commonly associated with exercise. Relaxation and rest may be some benefits of exercise, but they are more specific and not as overarching as good health."}

The other options do not make logical sense in this context. A spoon would not typically be placed in a bowl of soup or a serving dish, and it would not be relevant to a placemat or a glass of iced tea."}

The concept of copying is not relevant to the context of the sentence, and the other options may contribute to learning but do not directly answer the question of what is needed to learn hard concepts."}

Exercising helps individuals expend energy and release endorphins, which can produce a natural high and reduce cravings for drugs or other addictive substances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The options \"morning person,\" \"early bird,\" \"lark,\" and \"early riser\" all refer to people who are awake early in the morning, but they do not make a noise that is commonly associated with that time of day. A rooster, however, is known for its crowing at dawn, which makes it the most likely answer."}

A classroom may be associated with learning and socializing with peers, a toy store offers the opportunity to explore and choose from a wide variety of toys, a soccer game provides the chance to engage in physical activity and competition, and school in general offers a more structured environment for children to learn and grow. In contrast, dinner may be seen as a routine or tedious activity, especially if it involves eating something that the child dislikes."}

The word \"like\" suggests that the answer is a positive attribute, so we can eliminate options like \"poor\" and \"homeless.\" The word \"sleepy\" has no clear connection to bagels, so it can also be eliminated. The words \"plain\" and \"needy\" might be more likely to describe a bagel, but \"needy\" is not a positive attribute, so we can eliminate it. This leaves us with \"plain\" as the most likely answer, as many people enjoy plain bagels and it does not have any negative connotations."}

This is a common practice in retail, where customers are given shopping bags or other types of containers to hold their purchases. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence."}

Swimming is a good option because it can be done in bodies of water such as pools, lakes, or oceans. Jogging and working out usually require a solid surface to run or exercise on, and rock climbing requires a specific type of terrain. While exercise in general can help with getting in shape, the question specifically mentions a lack of land, making swimming the most viable option."}

Where might they be installed?"}}, "k": "kitchen\nKnowledge: The cabinets were bought by John and their purpose is not very clearly stated, but it can be inferred that they will be installed in a place where they can be seen and appreciated for their looks. Kitchens are a common area where cabinets are installed for both practical and aesthetic purposes. The other options, such as pantry or containing pots and pans, are related to the kitchen and may be areas where cabinets can be installed, but they do not specifically suggest that the cabinets were bought for their looks. In a flight or in Mexico have no connection to the context of the sentence."}

Of the choices given, stress, tension, and winning or losing can be consequences of competition, but they don't necessarily involve interaction between the competitors. Debates also involve interaction, but they don't necessarily have negative connotations. Arguments, on the other hand, are typically negative and involve two or more people attempting to prove their point, often leading to heightened emotions and conflict. Therefore, the correct answer is argument."}

They were standing in place.  The line was fast, but the children in front of them were loud.   They were what?"}}, "k": "being annoyed\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob and Boris were bothered by the loud children in front of them in the queue, which is commonly associated with being annoyed. Frustration and delays can be caused by various factors such as long waiting times or slow service, but there is no indication of this in the sentence. Irritation may be a similar option, but being annoyed captures the specific feeling of being bothered by the noise. Out of order does not fit the context of the sentence."}

He lives on his own. Where does he live?"}}, "k": "great outdoors\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the blowfish lives on its own and is not confined to a specific location. This suggests that the blowfish lives in the wild or the natural environment, which is often referred to as the great outdoors. The other options are not likely habitats for a free-living blowfish."}

This could be a notice from a delivery service, a reminder about an upcoming appointment, or a notice about a community event. The other options, such as conference or suitcase, do not make sense in the context of leaving a paper notice."}

Deception and aggression could also be traits exhibited in such a scenario, but they do not necessarily imply the intention to harm others. Altruism is the opposite of harming others, and stupidity is not a trait commonly associated with intentional harm."}

Additionally, the sentence mentions \"enjoying his first game in the bleachers,\" which implies that the child is watching a spectator sport rather than participating in an activity like a laboratory or pharmacy. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

The poor man likely felt sick after eating the uncooked chicken. The other options are also possible consequences of eating uncooked chicken, but \"illness\" is the most general and accurate description of what the poor man experienced."}

Excessive handwashing can lead to dry and irritated skin due to the loss of natural oils and moisture. The option \"use soap\" is not a consequence but a possible action related to handwashing. \"Cleanliness\" and \"thinking\" are unlikely to be negative consequences of obsessive handwashing. \"Wet towel\" is also not relevant to the sentence."}

Additionally, the phrase \"laying on the beach\" suggests a relaxed and leisurely activity, which supports the idea of sunning oneself for enjoyment or relaxation. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence or are unlikely motivations for someone laying on a beach."}

The option \"big house\" is the only choice that fits this description, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"reproducing\" in the sentence also supports this idea. Of the answer choices, \"birth\" is the only option that directly relates to the creation of new life. The other options are not related to reproduction and do not fit the context of the sentence."}

Africa is located near the equator and tends to have warm temperatures year-round, making it unlikely to always have snow. The roof and surface of the earth are not specific locations known for having snow, and Canada is known for its cold winters and snow, but not necessarily always having it year-round in all regions."}

To fit in and have fun, it's important to feel understood by others, which is a common desire among social beings. The other options may contribute to having fun with friends, but they do not necessarily address the underlying desire to fit in and feel understood."}

Sports require coordination and communication among team members to achieve a common goal, so it makes sense that the parents would sign their children up for sports to help them learn about teamwork. The other options do not necessarily involve teamwork in the same way that sports would."}

Drinking coffee is a common solution for feeling more awake and alert, as caffeine is a stimulant that can help counteract drowsiness. The other options, such as dreaming, thinking critically, crossing a road, or driving a car, are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide a solution for feeling more alert."}

In contrast, a town is a smaller urban area that typically has fewer businesses and services, and would be less likely to have hundreds of sporting goods stores. ESPN is a television network that specializes in sports coverage, but does not have any physical stores. Jerseys are a type of athletic equipment, but the question asks for a place, not an item. Therefore, the best answer is city."}

The phrase \"she didn't even care\" implies that she was intentionally doing something that was considered negative or hurtful. \"Being mean\" is a common behavior associated with selfishness, while the other options (crack, antipathy, disinterest, unfeeling) do not have a clear connection to the context given in the sentence."}

Roses, being a popular flower species, can be found in many botanic gardens across the world.

Therefore, it would not be surprising for the person to feel shocked when touching the wire. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the physical sensation or action of touching an exposed wire."}

Of the options provided, South Carolina is the only southern state listed, and the option \"hen house\" is not a location where a person would typically see a fox. Additionally, the option \"at the zoo\" implies that the fox is in captivity, which is not specified in the sentence. The options \"louisiana\" and \"arkansas\" are both southern states, but the sentence narrows the possible location down to one state, South Carolina."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "6e982b31a550b2758535d871ff3326ed", "question": {"question_concept": "orthodox", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "liberal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "heretical"}, {"label": "C", "text": "recalcitrant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "conservadox"}, {"label": "E", "text": "heretical"}], "stem": "The priest pushed for more orthodox behavior, what kind of behavior was he trying to stop?"}}, "k": "heretical\nKnowledge: The phrase \"more orthodox behavior\" suggests that the priest is advocating for traditional and strict adherence to religious doctrines and practices. The word \"heretical\" means departing from or denying fundamental religious beliefs or principles, and is the opposite of orthodox. The other choices may not necessarily be opposed to the priest's push for more orthodox behavior, or may be unrelated to religious principles."}

The phrase \"breathing fresh air\" indicates that the person may have been in a stuffy or polluted environment before, and is now enjoying the clean air in the mountains. Therefore, it is logical that the person would take deep breaths to fully appreciate the fresh air. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the person's response to the mountain air."}

It is commonly known that cows and other farm animals seek shelter during severe weather conditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Mars is a planet and does not contain the Indian Ocean. Asia and the East refer to a geographic region, while the Southern Hemisphere refers to a part of Earth, but none of these answer choices specifically identify the location of the Indian Ocean."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "bf02238ab227b089b1abd6c8296ae62c", "question": {"question_concept": "ficus", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "middle east"}, {"label": "B", "text": "palace"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dictionary"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pots"}, {"label": "E", "text": "apartment"}], "stem": "Where would a ficus plant brighten up a room?"}}, "k": "apartment\nKnowledge: The question is asking where a ficus plant would be suitable for adding brightness to a room. The word \"room\" suggests that the correct answer will be an indoor location, which rules out the options of middle east and palace. The option of dictionary doesn't make sense since a ficus plant cannot brighten up a book. The option of pots is also not suitable since it refers to a container rather than a location. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is apartment, which is a common location where people might have plants to add aesthetics to their living space."}

The refrigerator and freezer are both commonly used for this purpose, as they are able to keep food at colder temperatures and slow down the growth of bacteria. The oven is not useful for storing food, as it is typically used for cooking. The option \"bought at store\" is irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about how to store the turkey."}

What might this hole be called?"}}, "k": "gorge\nKnowledge: The word \"giant\" implies that the hole is large in size, which fits the definition of a gorge. A gorge is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides, often formed by a river or other body of water. The other options do not fit the description of a \"giant hole\" and are less likely to be found in a plain."}

The other options do not typically contain a significant amount of breathable air, except for possibly the space shuttle, which does have an artificial atmosphere, but still primarily relies on air as a source of oxygen."}

The option to \"listen to music\" makes the most sense, as it is a common way to relax while also shutting out external distractions. The other options do not fit with the context of being on a bus and trying to relax while surrounded by noisy passengers."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "17e5e2f42d600c5f5c4c38eb2cbd7314", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "the sun"}, {"label": "B", "text": "catch cold"}, {"label": "C", "text": "prepare to go"}, {"label": "D", "text": "feel humiliated"}, {"label": "E", "text": "hunt for food"}], "stem": "The person knew the police were after him, so what did he do?"}}, "k": "prepare to go\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was aware of being pursued by the police and likely preparing to flee or escape. \"Prepare to go\" is the most logical choice in relation to the context of the sentence. The other options have no clear connection to the situation of being pursued."}

The other options (flying, sweating, falling down, trip) do not accurately reflect the common feelings and experiences associated with running."}

This implies that they may not have practiced enough to be able to play without looking at the sheet music. Dexterity refers to physical skill, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that this is the issue. Idle time and knowledge of music are not directly related to the problem described in the sentence. A conductor is not relevant to the question as well."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "de66e0357bf7af5de53bcc9fbed593a4", "question": {"question_concept": "fragile", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "undestroyable"}, {"label": "B", "text": "unbreakable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "indestructible"}, {"label": "D", "text": "durable"}, {"label": "E", "text": "invisible"}], "stem": "In the movie a fragile man is causing accidents, his hope is to find a person opposite of him who is what?"}}, "k": "indestructible\nKnowledge: The sentence describes a character who is causing accidents and implies that the character is fragile, suggesting that the character is likely to be easily damaged or destroyed. The character's hope is to find a person who is the opposite of him, suggesting that the person he is looking for is likely to be extremely strong and resistant to damage. The word \"indestructible\" fits this description well, as it means impossible to destroy or damage. The other options do not fit the context as well, with the exception of \"unbreakable,\" which could also work but is not as strong as \"indestructible.\""}

The options of orchestra, school band, and opera house do not typically provide musical instruments for individual use outside of rehearsals or performances. Home is not a realistic option for obtaining a bass clarinet. Therefore, music store is the most likely answer as they specialize in selling and renting musical instruments."}

Learning is the only option in the choices that is related to the idea of acquiring knowledge. Painful memories, thinking, awe inspiring, and pleasure are not directly related to the process of making a decision about viewing artifacts."}

How might she come off?"}}, "k": "shy\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Mary was not comfortable speaking with James because she was not familiar with him. It can be inferred from this that she may come off as shy, as someone who is hesitant to engage with others they do not know. The other options do not necessarily suggest that Mary would appear as shy in this situation."}

A space center is a complex where rockets are launched and space exploration operations are conducted, often consisting of various launch pads, communication centers, and support buildings. The other options, such as movie or military installation, do not have any clear connection to the context of launching rockets."}

Therefore, it makes sense to store them in a building, where they can be protected from rain and other weather conditions. The other options either do not provide sufficient shelter from the rain or are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"slender\" is commonly used to describe someone who is thin and has a desirable body shape. The other options, such as \"free flowing\" and \"sparse,\" do not relate to body type or shape in the same way that \"slender\" does. \"Unacquainted\" and \"diet\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

A jigsaw puzzle has multiple small pieces that are assembled together, a chess game has a board and multiple pieces, and the misspelled options \"jigsaw puzzel puxxle\" and \"puxxle\" are not actual objects. The puzzle box, however, is typically made out of one piece of material that is intricately designed to be assembled or opened in a specific way."}

The phrase \"people like to\" further indicates that the sentence is discussing a popular activity or preference. The options \"expect to die\" and \"believe in god\" are not relevant to the topic of corn or food in general, while \"stay in\" and \"watch movies\" do not fit the context of the sentence.

The fact that he \"still had to walk\" suggests that he did not use his car to commute. The most likely reason for this is that he parked his car elsewhere, such as in a parking garage, which would require him to still walk to and from it after commuting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

Train stations sell tickets for cross-border trips, and these tickets are necessary to gain entry to another country. The other options, such as a baseball stadium, lottery, movie, or bus, do not have any clear connection to cross-border travel or the need for a ticket to enter another country."}

Laughter, having fun, and feeling happy all suggest positive emotions that are commonly associated with enjoyable activities, while getting hungry has no clear connection to playing aggressively."}

This suggests that they are in a learning environment, where asking questions is expected and encouraged. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence - becoming an adult, studying philosophy, and furthering education are more general goals that may apply to students, but they do not necessarily describe what the students are doing at the moment. Studying together is a possible activity for students, but it is not mentioned in the sentence."}

One possible explanation is that toothpicks are used to clean the teeth of animals, such as horses or cows. Keeping the toothpicks in a box would be a practical way to store them in a organized and accessible manner. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

The word \"analyze\" specifically means to examine something in great detail or to break it down into smaller parts, which is exactly what the detective would need to do with the clues. The other options do not match the meaning of the sentence."}

It is used to transfer power from the engine to the rear wheel using a chain. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of screwing a chain ring, and would not require such a component to be used in their construction or repair."}

A table is a flat surface that is commonly used for tasks that require close attention and access to materials, such as reading or writing. A dictionary is a reference tool that is frequently used alongside other materials, so having it on a table would make it convenient to reach and use while working. The other options (library, study area, classroom, shelf) do not necessarily offer the same level of accessibility or convenience for immediate use."}

The only choice that directly contrasts with \"go forth\" in this way is \"backwards.\" The other options either repeat words or do not provide an opposite meaning."}

Being alert is typically associated with being awake and aware of one's surroundings, while deep sleep and drinking coffee may indicate the opposite state of mind. Opening one's eyes is a necessary step to becoming awake, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee alertness. Consciousness is a broad term that could include both wakefulness and other states of awareness."}

A sheath is another word for a scabbard, and a sword closet or collection may also contain swords, but neither term specifically refers to the container for the sword. A museum may have swords on display, but they would not be found in your personal house."}

The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest actions that are not related to fighting or conflict."}

Among the options, the only one that typically involves reserving a room is a motel. While other places may have showers available, a motel room is the most likely option to have a shower as an expected amenity. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options such as laying eggs or eating fruit are not relevant to human races, and wrestling may not always be a part of a race. Drawing pictures also has no connection to the context of the question."}

Such houses typically incorporate cutting-edge technology and design elements that prioritize convenience and efficiency, including features like smart lighting and automated doors. The other options do not provide any indication of the type of house described in the sentence."}

The option \"water cooler\" is the most likely choice as it is a common fixture in workplaces where employees often gather to chat and take a break. The other options are not relevant to a workplace context or do not involve liquids. The option \"opera\" is a cultural event, \"hospital\" is a medical facility, \"hockey game\" is a sports event, and \"beach\" is a recreational spot."}

The most likely place for this to occur is at home. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "42d7d7be21fa10c33349698467034f8c", "question": {"question_concept": "fox", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "open meadow"}, {"label": "B", "text": "arctic tundra"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "great outdoors"}, {"label": "E", "text": "england"}], "stem": "Where could you find a fox hunting when not in a forest?"}}, "k": "england\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence implies that fox hunting is a common activity in England, and the question is asking where a fox hunting might occur outside of a typical forest habitat. The other options such as arctic tundra or beach do not provide a suitable environment for fox hunting. \"Great outdoors\" is too broad, and \"open meadow\" could potentially work, but the sentence does not provide any evidence to support that as a correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "72ef2d003d1e0b0fb5c0b7e8ed4a1435", "question": {"question_concept": "senior", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "republican party"}, {"label": "B", "text": "old people's home"}, {"label": "C", "text": "office"}, {"label": "D", "text": "park"}, {"label": "E", "text": "high school or college"}], "stem": "Lindy was a senior.  He lived with his children because he didn't want to go where?"}}, "k": "old people's home\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Lindy is old enough to be considered a senior, and that he is living with his children. The most likely reason he would do this is if he did not want to go to an old people's home. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "8880e7de8b2393d5bc9ce6c25c9de663", "question": {"question_concept": "getting wet", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "solidifying"}, {"label": "B", "text": "melting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "getting cold"}, {"label": "D", "text": "feeling cold"}, {"label": "E", "text": "skin rash"}], "stem": "What could be happening near you if the ground is getting wet?"}}, "k": "melting\nKnowledge: When the ground gets wet, it is likely due to something melting such as snow, ice, or frozen ground. Solidifying would not cause the ground to get wet, but rather the opposite - it would become more solid. Getting cold or feeling cold may be related to weather conditions, but they do not directly explain why the ground is getting wet. Skin rash is not relevant to the context of the question."}

Out of the choices provided, only \"home\" fits this criteria as it is the most likely place for an individual to keep their own personal magazines. Bookstores and libraries are locations where magazines can be found, but not necessarily where they are kept by individuals. Doctors' offices may have magazines for patients to read, but again, this is not where most people keep their own magazines. \"Table\" may be a location within a home where magazines are kept, but this is not necessarily the most common location."}

While consuming dog meat is not a widespread practice in Chinese cuisine, it does exist in some regions and has been subject to criticism from animal rights organizations.

An important part of counseling is the therapist's ability to listen actively and provide empathetic responses that validate the person's feelings and promote self-awareness. Therefore, going to counseling is usually for the purpose of getting a chance to talk and be heard, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of oneself. The other options do not accurately reflect the primary goals of counseling."}

Florida is a coastal state and is known for experiencing frequent thunderstorms, which makes it a likely location for a water spout to occur. The other options such as basement, sink, beach, and fountain do not have any connection with the context of the sentence."}

{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "0a0d0c29bd60c8e15d0ac8986423c359", "question": {"question_concept": "have fun", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "do enjoy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "get laid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "enjoyable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "work less"}, {"label": "E", "text": "enjoy living"}], "stem": "The rowdy frat boys shouted they would have fun and do what tonight?"}}, "k": "get laid\nKnowledge: The use of the term \"frat boys\" suggests that the sentence is referencing a group of college-aged men who engage in partying and sexual activities. The phrase \"have fun\" is often used as a euphemism for engaging in sexual activity, and the specific wording \"get laid\" is a more explicit way of expressing this. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the behavior associated with frat parties."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "f82c73e2c114c3cb73242c615ada8121", "question": {"question_concept": "having fun", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "being happy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "glee"}, {"label": "C", "text": "smoke"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stress relief"}, {"label": "E", "text": "may laugh"}], "stem": "What might someone do who is having fun?"}}, "k": "may laugh\nKnowledge: The phrase \"having fun\" typically implies that someone is enjoying themselves and finding pleasure in the activity they are engaged in. Laughing is a common physical expression of happiness and enjoyment, so it would make sense for someone who is having fun to also be laughing. The other choices, such as smoking or stress relief, do not necessarily correlate with having fun."}

He couldn't get out the door.  He was very frightened when the smoke detectors went off, but luckily it was a false alarm.  Why might he be stuck?"}}, "k": "winter storm\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions smoke detectors going off, which suggests that there was a potential danger of fire. However, the sentence also states that it was a false alarm, meaning that there was no actual fire. This narrows down the possible reasons for John being stuck to something other than a fire. The sentence also mentions a winter storm, which is a more likely explanation for John being stuck in his house. Face south and belong to are unrelated to the context of the sentence, while burn down is a possible consequence of a fire but not a reason for John being stuck."}

The word \"center\" is also commonly associated with control panels, command centers, or other central locations for operations. The other options - nuclear power plant, basement, main office, and bowel of the ship - are either irrelevant, too specific, or too general to be the correct answer."}

The word \"build\" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as the other options do not relate to the idea of constructing a new barn. \"Make\" and \"entice\" do not make sense in connection with a barn, while \"raise\" is typically used in reference to money or raising animals, not constructing a building."}

The husband's response implies that accidents are a common occurrence and that they happen to people. The other options may also be true, but they do not directly relate to the context of the article or the conversation between the couple."}

In the given sentence, it is mentioned that there was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, and the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers. This suggests that both episodes were related to the theme of flowers, and were part of an anthology series that focused on different aspects of gardening or nature. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, the only option left for them to eat was to leave the house and obtain food from an external source. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not address the lack of food in the cupboards."}

Fleas use their powerful hind legs to propel themselves up to 200 times their body length, allowing them to move quickly and efficiently through fur or hair.

A more professional and regulated location for prostitution would be a brothel or whorehouse, which is likely to offer a higher level of safety and hygiene. New York is also known for having a high concentration of sex workers, making it a likely choice for finding a professional prostitute. The option \"corner of two streets\" does not provide any relevant information to this question, and \"brother\" is completely unrelated."}

This description is most commonly associated with lamps, which are often used for their aesthetic value as well as their functional purpose of providing light. The other options (sun, sky, candle, house) either do not fit the context of the sentence or are not commonly associated with being vintage or decorative light sources."}

Surfing the internet would allow them to access a wide range of information and resources about the topic of interest without having to physically leave their home. The other options require leaving the house, such as going to see exhibits, attending an outdoor concert, or hearing testimony in person."}

Joe was the opposite.  What was Joe, regarding that decision?"}}, "k": "being for\nKnowledge: The sentence states that Sam was against Allison's decision and Joe was the opposite. This suggests that Joe was not against Allison's decision like Sam was, but rather for it. The option \"being for\" expresses this idea directly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or convey the opposite of Sam's stance in relation to Allison's decision."}

This suggests that the reason for not wanting to work with wood may be related to physical discomfort. The other options are focused on financial or emotional reasons, which do not relate to the physical pain of blisters."}

Geography, history studies, and religion could fall under the category of social science, but the sentence doesn't specifically mention them as being the person's favorite subject. Math and dancing are not related to either traditional or social science, so they are less likely to be the correct answer."}

Living in a palace would be a fitting choice as they are grand and luxurious buildings typically associated with wealth and status. The other options, such as \"big house\" or \"men's room,\" do not necessarily connote wealth or lavishness in the same way that a palace would."}

Towns and cities are both likely to have bookstores, although they may differ in their size and variety of offerings. Carpeting, phone books, and magazines are not likely to be places where one can find a bookstore."}

She faced a lot of what?"}}, "k": "disparagement\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jill was not well-liked or respected by many people, except for John. The word \"respect\" indicates that John held her in high regard, but the phrase \"not many other people did\" indicates that most others did not feel the same way about Jill. The word \"disparagement\" means criticism or belittlement, which could explain why Jill was not well-liked or respected by many people. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing something that needs to be done, often due to a feeling of anxiety or a lack of motivation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as sitting down, excitement, tiredness, and progress do not necessarily have a direct link to starting work."}

The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why waiting for the doctor would be difficult for people who need to do work."}

Watching a favorite show is likely to provide entertainment and a sense of familiarity, which could satisfy the desire for viewing enjoyment. The other options, such as examining things or staring into a mirror, do not relate to watching something for entertainment or enjoyment. Hearing news or going somewhere may spark curiosity, which is not what the question is asking for."}

Given that the question asks about what a lover is likely to want to do with their partner, it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer pertains to intimacy or physical affection. The other options may be desirable outcomes in a relationship, but they do not specifically relate to physical intimacy."}

Shopping malls are a common location for retail shops that sell clothes and provide bags for customers to carry their purchases. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"contaminated\" means that something has been made impure or tainted, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices don't fit with the context, as they don't describe something that could happen to a sample in a lab."}

This practice was known as bloodletting and was believed to balance the body's humors, or fluids. While leeches have also been used in modern medicine for certain purposes (such as promoting blood circulation and reducing swelling), bloodletting is generally considered a outdated and ineffective treatment. The other options (heart transplant, distance himself, perform surgery, study medicine) do not have any connection to the historical use of leeches."}

The phrase \"looking for new things\" is a clear indication of their motivations, and the option \"welcome change\" best captures this sentiment. The other options are either irrelevant or do not fit the context of the sentence."}

Out of the choices given, only \"carry object\" makes sense because a handle on a carry object, such as a bag or suitcase, is designed to make it easier to transport. The other options do not make sense in this context - a handle on a coffee cup or frying pan would not make it easier to carry, and a handle on a hat would not serve a practical purpose for transportation."}

Desire and needs may influence the decision to purchase, but ultimately, having the monetary means to pay for the item is necessary. Spending money and time are not prerequisites for purchasing, as the former implies that the money has already been spent, and the latter may not be relevant to the context of buying products."}

This is commonly referred to as fatigue. Sickness and motion sickness are unrelated to the context of traveling, while relocation refers to a permanent move rather than a one-time trip. Jet lag is a common side effect of traveling across time zones, but it is more specific than the general feeling of fatigue that the question is asking about."}

The use of the word \"focus\" suggests that this quality is related to being committed and determined, which can be further described as \"dedication\". The other options do not match the meaning of the sentence, as hatred and surprised have negative connotations, compliments are not related to achieving greatness, and solutions do not fit the context."}

Hearing sounds is the most logical answer as it is a direct and immediate effect of exposure to noise. The other options, such as petting a dog, having sex, or driving cars, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question. Reproduction may be a possible long-term effect of noise exposure, but it is not an immediate or certain outcome."}

This limits the options to train stations, as they are the only location where transportation on rails typically arrives and departures. The other options, such as airports, bookstores, and newsstands, do not fit the criteria outlined in the sentence. Waiting room could potentially fit, but it is not specific enough to suggest that transportation on rails is involved."}

He could see clouds when he looked out his window.

Additionally, the sentence mentions that James can see clouds from his window, which further supports the idea that he is living high above ground level. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as living in books, working at a radio station, or living in a medieval castle do not involve living in a tall tower."}

The phrase \"on a platform\" indicates that the performers are elevated and visible to an audience, which is commonly found in concert halls. Arenas can also have performers on a platform, but they are more commonly associated with sporting events. A building or museum may have performers, but they are unlikely to be on a platform in a public space. A dock is not a common location for performers, and the sentence does not suggest that the performers are on a boat or ship."}

The most likely location for someone to store items they don't frequently use, such as decorations or old clothes, is in the attic.

Farmland, property, and subdivision all suggest larger pieces of land, so they are unlikely to have a \"tiny\" yard. City could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough to make a definitive choice. Neighborhood, on the other hand, suggests a smaller, more densely populated area where yards might indeed be small."}

The wording of the question implies that love is a lasting emotion, rather than something that is temporary or fleeting.

Grocery stores are one option for purchasing potatoes, but a bushel basket would be too large for personal use. Restaurants would not be relevant in this context, and while farmer's markets can be a source for potatoes, they are typically sold in smaller quantities that can be easily carried in a bag."}

This is typically achieved through the use of brakes, which slow down the car and bring it to a stop. Stripes and radios are not related to driving performance or safety, while seat belts are important for overall safety but not specifically related to stopping at a light. Tires may also play a role in braking ability, but are not as directly related as the brakes themselves."}

While the options \"glass of water\" and \"build evenly\" may suggest methods to make things straight, they do not provide an answer to where Bob can obtain a level. The option \"garage\" is too general and does not specify whether there is someone in the garage who may have a level. The option \"video game\" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the only logical option is \"carpenter's shop,\" where Bob can purchase or borrow a level."}

The most likely reason is due to injuries, which can range from minor sprains and strains to more severe fractures and tears. Pain, sweating, and rain may all be uncomfortable or inconvenient, but they would not necessarily prevent athletes from competing. A mudslide is a rare and extreme weather event that would likely result in the cancellation or postponement of a game, rather than simply preventing athletes from competing."}

The sentence indicates that the shed would be located in a town, which suggests that the options \"farm yard\" and \"ranch\" are not appropriate choices. The shed is also meant to be close to the house, as per the option \"next to the house.\" However, the best location for a shed in a town is often the backyard because it allows for easy access to the outdoors while keeping the shed out of sight and secure."}

Envelopes are commonly used to send bills and other documents through the mail, making them the most likely answer in this context. The other options do not have a clear connection to the concept of receiving bills through the mail."}

But I had a crippling fear of going where?"}}, "k": "outside\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was comfortable in their own home, but had a fear of going somewhere else. The word \"crippling\" implies that the fear is severe and debilitating. The option \"outside\" is the most logical choice, as it is the opposite of being inside one's own home and could potentially cause discomfort or anxiety for someone with a fear of leaving their safe space. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The choices \"refrigerator,\" \"engineering school,\" and \"tree\" do not fit this criterion. The choice \"market\" could potentially work, as some markets have decorative bridges, but the most likely answer is \"san francisco\" as the city is famous for its landmark Golden Gate Bridge, which is red and has pedestrian walkways where people could eat fruit."}

The options \"school,\" \"large home,\" and \"house\" do not fit this context. The option \"closet\" could be a possibility, but the question specifically mentions head wear and a hat rack is more commonly associated with storing hats.

Jokes and humor are often associated with making people happy, but they are not necessarily surprising and unexpected. Frightened and fight are related to negative emotions and do not relate to making people happy. Laughter is a common response to humor and unexpected situations, and can be a sign of happiness or amusement. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be laughter."}

Utah and New Hampshire may have lizards, but they are not typically associated with Spanish-speaking communities or culture. Japan is not known for its reptiles, and South America is a large continent with many countries, some of which may speak Spanish. New Mexico, on the other hand, has a variety of lizard species and is known for its culture and history that includes both Spanish and Native American influences."}

However, \"lady's boudoir\" does not provide any security measures and may even make the jewelry more vulnerable to theft or loss. Therefore, it is not a safe way to transport jewelry on vacation."}

Johnny wanted it to be over.  What might he choose to do?"}}, "k": "settle everything\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Johnny wants the conflict between him and Bill to end.

Looking good is the most likely outcome of such a regular grooming routine. Tardiness and injury can be ruled out as they are negative outcomes that do not relate to grooming. Vacation is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Neatness may be a possible result, but is less likely than looking good as the focus of the sentence is on the man's grooming routine rather than his overall tidiness."}

Therefore, the attack likely brought an end to the defending force's ability to continue resisting or protecting themselves, making \"defence\" the correct answer. Surrender would imply that the defending force chose to yield, while retreat suggests they were able to withdraw instead of being defeated. Cease fire implies a mutual agreement to stop fighting, rather than a single force being defeated. Defend is not the correct answer because it is the action taken by the defenders, rather than what the attack ended."}

Fatigue is a condition where the body feels tired or weak, often as a result of physical activity or lack of rest. The other options do not accurately describe the effects of dancing for a long time. Soreness is a possible symptom of fatigue, but it is not a direct result of dancing. Intercourse and expression are unrelated to the topic of dancing for a long time."}

The option \"resort\" implies that the area was primarily developed for tourism, while \"ocean\" and \"beach\" are not specific enough to identify a location. \"California\" is a state and not an appropriate answer for this specific question."}

This is because alcohol affects the brain's ability to process information, making it difficult to concentrate and think clearly. As a result, people who are intoxicated are more likely to slurr their words, mumble, or say nonsensical things. The other options are either consequences of becoming drunk (regret, automobile accidents, drunk driving) or unrelated to the question (talk intelligently)."}

The sentence also mentions that he hasn't gotten what he needed in a long time, which could suggest that he has been overworking or not getting enough rest. Addiction may cause physical symptoms, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Relaxation and overeating do not fit with the symptoms described.

The options of bathroom, purse, and water do not provide any indication of where such a product might be found. Hand lotion is a similar product, but not necessarily the same as a moistener. Therefore, the best option is a drug store, which is a common place to find moisturizing products such as lotions and creams."}

The question then asks what formula was used after that. Therefore, the correct answer would be the original formula, as it was the formula used before the introduction of \"new coke.\" The other options, such as \"old,\" \"coke clear,\" \"former,\" and \"familiar,\" do not indicate what formula was used after \"new coke\" was discontinued."}

Rainforests are known for their dense foliage and tall trees, which provide ideal habitat for monkeys to climb and swing from branch to branch. While it is possible to see monkeys in zoological gardens or zoos, they are often kept in enclosures or exhibits and may not have access to actual trees. \"Rainforest\" and \"great outdoors\" are too general and do not provide specific information about where in the rainforest a monkey may be found."}

Antipathy means a strong feeling of dislike or hostility towards someone, which fits the context of the sentence. Unfeeling means lacking in emotion or compassion, but it does not necessarily imply a negative feeling towards someone. Negligence means the failure to take proper care, and indifferent means having no particular interest or sympathy. Rapport means a close and harmonious relationship, which is the opposite of what the sentence describes."}

The options \"injuries\" and \"accidents\" are both related to the negative effects of reckless driving, whereas \"fatigue\" and \"tired\" suggest a different type of driving behavior. \"Traffic jams\" are not necessarily caused by reckless driving, although it can contribute to it in some cases."}

The most logical place for this to happen would be at a port, which is a location where ships can dock and unload their cargo. The other options, such as cargo ship or refrigerator, do not make sense in this context as they are not places where containers can be unloaded. Food and lorry may be associated with transporting goods but do not provide a clear answer to where the containers are unloaded."}

The other options, such as the ocean and jungle, are not suitable habitats for lions due to their different environments and lack of suitable prey. The veldt is similar to a savannah and could be a possible answer, but the context of the question and the more commonly used term \"savannah\" suggests that it is the more likely answer."}

A petting zoo is a place where people can interact with animals, including ferrets, and give them attention, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A ferret in a trouser leg, sick bay, own home, or mother's hair may not necessarily be getting a lot of attention."}

If the reference denies any knowledge of the applicant, it would fail to confirm the reference. The other options do not necessarily imply a failure to confirm the reference. Questioning, disputing, contradicting, or refusing to provide information may still allow for some verification of the applicant's credentials."}

The phrase \"cheered\" further solidifies this idea. \"Toasting\" is a common action associated with raising a drink in celebration, which makes it the most appropriate choice. \"Thirsty\" and \"refreshment\" are not accurate options, as they do not suggest any kind of celebration or gesture of acknowledgement. \"Getting drunk\" is possible but is not supported by the context of the sentence."}

The most logical activity for the watcher to be engaged in would be to listen to the music being played. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - auditioning applies to a different scenario, hear sounds is too general, making music implies that the watcher is also playing, and arthritis is a medical condition that is unrelated to the sentence."}

Therefore, they may have had to resort to asexual reproduction, which does not require the ability to swim or find a mate. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This immediately eliminates options like concert, gig, and recording studio, which are not typically associated with stock market events. TV studios are commonly used to broadcast live events, including stock market events, and New York is a major financial center where many such events take place. However, the sentence only suggests a likelihood, so the answer cannot be determined with complete certainty without further information."}

What does this make him feel?"}}, "k": "being happy\nKnowledge: The question suggests that something important is happening to John, which is likely to evoke a positive emotion. The choice \"being happy\" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the most commonly associated emotion with receiving or achieving something important. The other options, such as \"headaches\" and \"wanting more,\" do not align with the context of the sentence and are not likely to be related to the emotion that John is feeling. The choice \"stoic\" also does not fit, as it refers to a person being unemotional and not showing any feelings."}

He felt that the alternative might have results that were too what?"}}, "k": "religious\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James made a decision about how the AI should be raised based on his belief that a religious upbringing would have negative consequences. The other options (eternal, unpredictable, holy, and monastic) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, the correct answer would be \"closed\" as this implies that the owner is keeping the door shut to prevent the kitten from entering the room. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence - \"opened\" contradicts the idea of restricting access while \"found at shower\" and \"falling down\" are unrelated to the sentence. \"Locked\" is a possibility, but is not explicitly stated and \"closed\" is the more common way of restricting a pet's access to a specific room."}

Cats, like all animals, need water to survive, and therefore it makes sense that they would drink water every day. While some cats may enjoy playing or annoying others, these actions are not necessary for their survival and do not happen every day for all cats. The other options, such as opening doors or needing food, could happen every day for some cats but are not as universal as drinking water."}

This suggests that they were hired to attract attention to a particular store or business. The other options (advertisement, magazine, web page, bus) do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they are not physical locations where someone could dance and wave an advertisement."}

It is usually kept on the countertop for easy access when a hot beverage is desired.

Movies, opera, and theater commonly have permanent seating with individual seats. Lecture halls may have fixed seating arrangements, but they are not typically referred to as bleachers. Therefore, the option that best fits the description of bleachers is a hockey game, or any outdoor sports event."}

The purpose of a card catalog is to help library patrons find and locate specific books, so it is logical that the index card would have been returned to the card catalogue once the person found the book they needed.

The carpenter would need to identify which part of the shelf is causing the instability and fix that component. Given that the sentence specified \"corner\", it is likely that this is the area of the shelf that requires attention to stabilize it. None of the other options provided are directly related to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"beauty\" may be a reference to the fairytale \"Beauty and the Beast,\" in which the protagonist falls in love with a beast. Therefore, the correct answer is likely \"beast.\" The other options (ugly, ugliness, satellite, top of mountain) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The most logical place to put a dry mug would be on a shelf, as this is a common storage location for cups and other dishes. The other options, such as \"desktop\" or \"kitchen,\" do not provide a clear indication of where the mug should be placed in relation to other objects or surfaces."}

Dicks Sporting Goods and Sears are both stores that sell sporting equipment, but mall does not specifically indicate any stores that sell sports equipment. Sporting event could be a possible answer, but it does not necessarily mean that all participants will need sports equipment as some may just be spectators. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a sporting goods store, which is a location dedicated to selling sports equipment for all participants."}

The grocery store is the most logical choice as it is a location where one can purchase a variety of canned food items. The other options, such as a shelf or cupboard, suggest locations within one's own home where canned goods might be stored, but not purchased. The cellar and refrigerator may contain canned goods, but not to the extent that a grocery store would."}

Where would he go to get to the third floor of his apartment building?"}}, "k": "elevator\nKnowledge: Since John is in a wheelchair, he would not be able to use the stairs to reach the third floor. The other options, such as the space shuttle and downtown, are not applicable to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be the elevator, which is typically used for vertical transportation in multi-story buildings and would be accessible for someone in a wheelchair."}

The most common place to put wrapped gifts during the holiday season is under a Christmas tree. The other options, such as department store or specialty store, do not make sense in relation to the mother wrapping gifts. A Frazier fir is a type of Christmas tree, but it does not fit logically in this sentence. A Christmas stocking is typically hung up and not used to store wrapped gifts."}

Empowering and glee are unlikely emotions in this context, while despair and sadness may be too extreme for someone who is simply unable to stop unintentionally causing harm."}

The most likely location for this to occur is a mail box, where letters are often left for delivery. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Spectators are likely interested in whether one team will win or both will end in a draw, which is why winning or losing is the correct answer. Envy and resentment do not relate to the context of the sentence, while one winner and two winners do not make sense since there are only two teams competing."}

What might she be a member of?"}}, "k": "high school or college\nKnowledge: The capitalization of \"House\" suggests that it is a proper noun and likely refers to a specific institution or group. The mention of Sally being a senior indicates that this institution or group has some sort of hierarchical structure, which is commonly found in high schools and colleges. The other options - assisted living facility, old people's home, and republican party - do not fit the context of a senior in the House. \"Organization\" could potentially fit, but it is too vague without additional context."}

New York is known for its skyline of skyscrapers, many of which house a variety of businesses and offices. The other options (school building, grocery store) are unlikely locations for offices, and \"work\" and \"business\" are too general to provide a clear answer."}

The options \"spacecraft,\" \"hall,\" and \"palace\" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are all significantly larger than a cabin. \"Hotel\" could be a possibility, but \"villa\" is a more likely choice given that it suggests a higher level of luxury and comfort than a typical hotel room."}

Where would he look?"}}, "k": "south pacific ocean\nKnowledge: The sentence states that Johnny is looking for blowfish in places that aren't near America. Therefore, we can eliminate Gulf of Mexico and Hawaiian waters as they are located in or near America. The other options remain, but tropical sea is too vague a description and could refer to multiple locations. Therefore, the best answer is South Pacific Ocean, which is a specific location known for its diverse marine life, including blowfish."}

If he takes the highway South and doesn't stop, where will he end up next?"}}, "k": "mexico\nKnowledge: The question specifies that John is traveling on a highway heading South from Texas without stopping.

What might they be watching?"}}, "k": "movies\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions a projector and a huge screen, which are commonly associated with showing movies.

This is a common way of referring to the development of technology over time. The options \"mobile phone,\" \"briefcase,\" \"office,\" and \"desktop\" are all more modern inventions and do not fit the historical context suggested by the sentence. A calculator that fits on a wristwatch, however, was a major technological breakthrough when it was first introduced."}

The options \"no spouse\" and \"lose money\" may be negative consequences for one of the spouses, but not for someone else. \"Lot of grief\" and \"depression\" could be experienced by anyone involved in the divorce, not just someone other than a spouse. Therefore, the option \"children suffer\" is most likely the correct answer as children are often deeply affected by their parents' divorce, both emotionally and in other ways such as their living arrangements and financial stability."}

This means that the hiring process should be fair and unbiased so that everyone has an equal chance of being hired based on their qualifications and skills. The other options, such as critical thinking, congratulated, compliments, and raffle tickets, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information in answering the question."}

Where might he look first?"}}, "k": "desk drawer\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James is likely in a location where he would have access to a desk or workspace, such as a home or office. A desk drawer would be a logical place to store a pencil sharpener in this context. The other options do not have a clear association with storing office supplies. A cabinet could be used to store a variety of items, a library would not typically have office supplies, a nightstand is typically used for personal items, and a stationery store would require James to leave his current location to find a sharpener."}

Tide pools, current, and cooking pots do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be obstacles in the crab's path."}

In many homes, pantries are located near the kitchen and are designed to keep dishes organized and easily accessible. On the other hand, shelves can be used to store both dishes and books, as can a living room, table, or apartment depending on the individual's preferences and living arrangements."}

He loved the idea of going to mars, and reads books about it all the time.   He dreams of being on what?"}}, "k": "space shuttle\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that James is interested in outer space and specifically mentions that he loves the idea of going to Mars. This suggests that James is interested in space travel and would ideally want to reach Mars on a spacecraft. The other options, such as love, zoo, school, and library, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

A cargo ship is a vessel for transporting large quantities of goods, and a port is a location for ships to dock. A refrigerator is used for storing food, but it is not a container. A closet and garage are spaces to store items, but not necessarily in a container. Therefore, the correct answer is food, as it is something that can be placed in a container for transport or storage."}

Yelling may be a way for parents to assert authority and get their children to follow directions, especially in situations where there is a lot of noise or activity. The other options do not match the context of the sentence as well – guiding, understanding, caring for, or venting anger are not necessarily associated with yelling in times of chaos."}

He searched and found a large menu of what?"}}, "k": "internet sites\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James was searching for a place to buy bitcoins, which is typically done through online exchanges or websites. The other options, such as a bar or cafe, do not make sense in this context as they are not commonly associated with buying and selling digital currency."}

Counting cards is considered cheating and is illegal in many casinos. This practice involves keeping track of the cards that have been dealt, enabling the player to better predict which cards will be dealt next. This increases the player's chances of winning and is seen as an unfair advantage against the house. Remembering, helping, winning, and dealing are not necessarily illegal, depending on the circumstances and rules of the particular game."}

Additionally, parks usually have designated areas for waste disposal in order to keep the space clean and enjoyable for everyone. The other options may have trash cans, but parks are the most likely choice based on the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "8f9390dc895f036c0af6c0b0c0fb4d2e", "question": {"question_concept": "notepad", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "back pocket"}, {"label": "B", "text": "meeting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "drug store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "home"}, {"label": "E", "text": "school"}], "stem": "Where can you store a small notepad on your person?"}}, "k": "back pocket\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the notepad is small enough to be stored on your person, which rules out options such as home and school. The word \"meeting\" could potentially suggest a briefcase or bag, but there is no clear indication that the notepad needs to be taken to a meeting specifically. The phrase \"on your person\" implies that the notepad needs to be easily accessible, which makes the back pocket a logical choice. The drug store has no relevance to the context of the sentence."}

Evaluating is a more appropriate term in this context because it implies a comprehensive assessment of the pigs' qualities and characteristics. Verdict suggests a final decision, but judging is an ongoing process. Responsibility is not specific enough to the context of the sentence, and prejudice implies a biased perspective, which would not be appropriate in a fair judging competition."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "69993ab69debddcb7860984d9618ecc8", "question": {"question_concept": "instituting civil action", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "complications"}, {"label": "B", "text": "tiredness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "anger"}, {"label": "D", "text": "trial"}, {"label": "E", "text": "court case"}], "stem": "What feeling might propel one to instituting civil action?"}}, "k": "anger\nKnowledge: Civil actions are typically initiated by individuals who feel wronged and seek justice or compensation. Anger is a common emotion that may motivate someone to take legal action, as they may feel that their rights have been violated or they have suffered some form of injustice. Complications and tiredness do not typically lead to civil action, and trial and court case are more specific steps within the legal process rather than emotions or motivations."}

Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going?"}}, "k": "pet store\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John is opposed to animal abuse and loves animals, which could make him hesitant to go to a pet store. Pet stores have been criticized for mistreating animals, so John may avoid visiting them to avoid supporting this kind of abuse. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The phrase \"gives you\" suggests that the correct answer should indicate a positive outcome (i.e. gaining something), rather than a negative one (i.e. getting angry). \"Education\" is the most appropriate choice, as it implies that reading a newspaper can broaden your understanding of current events and increase your knowledge of the world around you. \"Concern\" and \"worrie\" are similar in meaning, both indicating a feeling of worry or unease, but they do not accurately reflect the positive benefits of reading a newspaper. \"Learning about world\" is also a possible choice, but it is more general and less specific to the question of local current events."}

When a performer takes center stage, it means they move to the main area where all attention is focused on them, typically the middle of the stage. This is a common phrase used in theater and performance to indicate that the performer is starting their performance. The other options do not make sense in this context - \"persuade\", \"challenge\", and \"speak clearly\" suggest actions during a performance, but not necessarily at the beginning, while \"slept\" is clearly an incorrect option."}

Furniture stores do not typically sell fishing equipment, nor do hardware stores, which specialize in hardware and construction tools. While a fishing camp may sell fishing rods, it is not a common place for consumers to purchase them. Engines do not have any relation to fishing equipment."}

The correct answer is \"slow down\" because if someone bumps into you while walking, it's likely because they need to slow down and watch where they're going. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "28d13cf7620ba593dfe1ad263abbc869", "question": {"question_concept": "watching tv", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "erections"}, {"label": "B", "text": "entertainment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "boredom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "get fat"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sadness"}], "stem": "I'm watching tv because there is nothing else to do, what do I expect to get from this?"}}, "k": "entertainment\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person is watching TV to pass their time and find something to occupy themselves, which is typically associated with seeking entertainment. The other options (erections, boredom, getting fat, sadness) do not seem to be appropriate options for what someone might expect to get from watching TV in this context."}

The car trunk is a common storage area for items in a vehicle and is designed for keeping items secure and out of sight. The other options, such as the roof or a retail store, are not relevant to the context of the question."}

Jerusalem is known as a holy city for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and has a rich history of religious architecture, including the Temple Mount. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The sentence also mentions that people are waiting to use electronics, which suggests that they have already boarded the plane. Reading is a common activity for people to do on planes, especially during takeoff and landing when electronic devices have to be turned off. Buying tickets is also not relevant to the question, as that is done before boarding the plane."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "9f468ca8e00308c1159fcc9adf6f45ff", "question": {"question_concept": "attending school", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "inspiration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "much work"}, {"label": "C", "text": "boredom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "graduate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "degree"}], "stem": "After attending school for twelve years what do you do?"}}, "k": "graduate\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who has attended school for twelve years is expected to do something specific afterwards. One possible outcome is to \"graduate,\" which means to receive a diploma or certificate of completion after finishing a program of study. The other options, such as \"inspiration,\" \"much work,\" and \"boredom,\" do not make sense in this context and are unlikely to be the correct answer. \"Degree\" is a related term, but it does not necessarily imply that someone has completed a program of study and may not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "5d99898aa689654fe8aa3c4a9c98fb7d", "question": {"question_concept": "expressing yourself", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "self pity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "communication"}, {"label": "C", "text": "understood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "embarrassment"}], "stem": "When you are expressing yourself by yelling after getting a bruise, what are you feeling?"}}, "k": "pain\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is yelling after getting a bruise, which indicates a physical sensation. The options \"self pity,\" \"communication,\" and \"embarrassment\" do not directly relate to physical pain. \"Understood\" may suggest that the person's pain is being acknowledged, but it is not a clear answer on its own. Therefore, \"pain\" is the most fitting option."}

Rather, it moves the masts on what?"}}, "k": "sailing vessel\nKnowledge: The word \"helm\" is related to steering or controlling a vessel. The fact that the sentence mentions the helm moving the masts suggests that it is a device used on sailing vessels, which use masts to power their movement. The other options may not have masts or may use alternative methods of propulsion that do not involve masts, making them less likely choices."}

The most logical answer would be a room dedicated to music, such as a music room, as it would likely have proper storage and conditions for musical instruments. The other options, such as under a bed or at a symphony, do not make sense in the context of the question. The option for a music store also doesn't make sense as the question is asking for a location in your home, not a store outside of your home."}

The choices are all different locations, but only the front porch is a place where someone would typically deliver a newspaper to your home. The other options, such as a classroom, synagogue, bathroom or grocery store, do not have any connection to receiving a newspaper delivery."}

This can involve working on a wide range of skills, such as articulation, fluency, and language development. The option \"complete sentences\" is the most closely related to this definition, as forming complete sentences is a fundamental aspect of effective communication.

It wasn't the bloodsucking that he disliked, it was that the insects made what?"}}, "k": "buzz\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason John disliked mosquitoes is not because they suck blood, but because they make a particular noise. Mosquitoes are known for their high-pitched buzzing sound, which is often associated with irritation and annoyance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The addition of \"feel more comfortable\" implies that the action of curling up under the blanket accomplished its goal of making the person feel more at ease. The other options (sleep, sweating, blush, cuddle) do not match the context of the sentence as well."}

The other options do not have any connection to the location mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, blowfish are commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean, which further supports the answer choice."}

The word \"gratitude\" is the most fitting option as it refers to the feeling of being grateful for someone's actions. The other options do not directly match the context of the sentence. \"Let down\" and \"disappointment\" would be more suitable if the person had expectations that were not met. \"Respect\" would be more appropriate if the person was looking for recognition, and \"illness\" and \"satisfaction\" do not fit the context."}

The use of the word \"playing\" suggests that the activity was not a serious one, and the absence of any mention of gambling or money indicates that the family was not playing to win or lose anything. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is \"having fun\"."}

Therefore, it is more likely for a large village to be located in a rural area rather than a big city, suburbs, or a specific state like Ohio. The term countryside also refers to a rural area, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of a large village."}

The other options do not fit the context of the question as well. A bookcase is where books are kept, not typically school supplies. An office supply store may sell binders, but it would not be the location of the actual binder containing the homework assignments. An office or classroom may have a binder containing assignments, but it would not be the most common location for a student to find their own binder."}

He was a clown, and acted very ridiculous.  This cheerfulness turned off people who expected the funeral to be what?"}}, "k": "somber\nKnowledge: The description of Shane's behavior as \"ridiculous\" and \"cheerful\" suggests that it was not appropriate for the somber and serious occasion of a funeral. The word \"somber\" means serious and solemn, which is more in line with what people typically expect at a funeral. The other options do not fit with the context of a funeral or the tone conveyed in the sentence."}

The fact that they used a folding chair inside their room suggests that they may not have had enough furniture or were using makeshift items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

Where might it be?"}}, "k": "idaho\nKnowledge: The sentence provides geographic information that the department store is located in the Northwest USA. New York and big city are not in the Northwest region, while town and shopping mall are not specific enough to determine a location. Idaho is a state in the Northwest region, so it is the best choice."}

The people wearing white coats also support this idea, as scientists often wear lab coats in a research setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "26aa456d3e43a460b0f5c42f297903a0", "question": {"question_concept": "table", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "library"}, {"label": "B", "text": "demonstration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "corner"}, {"label": "D", "text": "football ground"}, {"label": "E", "text": "rug"}], "stem": "What could you put a table in if you want the table to be in your house?"}}, "k": "corner\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to put a table in their house, which implies that they need an indoor space for it. Libraries and demonstrations are public spaces that are unlikely to have furniture like a table, while a football ground is an outdoor space. A rug is also not a suitable option as it is a floor covering, not a container for a table. A corner of a room, however, is a common location to place a table, making it the most likely answer."}

Bathing can help animals maintain their hygiene, regulate their body temperature, and even reduce stress. The other options either do not relate to observable behaviors or are less commonly studied in animal behavior research."}

That meant that the only time to leave was when?"}}, "k": "night\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah believed she had been at home all evening, implying that she did not leave during that time. Therefore, the only time for her to have left would have been after evening, which is the night. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they occur prior to the evening or are too similar to evening (i.e., daytime)."}

The only remaining option is the basement, which is commonly located below ground level in a house or building."}

In many countries, only certain specialized units or officers with specific responsibilities, such as detectives or SWAT team members, are authorized to carry firearms. The other options, such as directing traffic or helping people, could apply to a wider range of police officers."}

The child wants to teach his grandpa to read because he believes it is wrong for someone to go through life without this basic skill. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

While books and television are also common sources of information, newspapers have a long history of being a primary source for daily news updates. Meetings and guides may provide information, but they are not typically sources for general knowledge about the world."}

The only option that fits this context is perfume, as it is a scented product that could potentially be disliked by someone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While compliments and intellectual challenges could potentially be received by a competent student, they are not necessarily guaranteed or directly related to competence. Stickers may be given as a reward system in some classrooms, but they are not a direct result of academic competence. Avoiding pain is not related to the context of the question."}

Rocks are a common object that lizards will lay on to bask in the sun and absorb its heat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The wife's response indicates that she expects the deodorant to be in a specific location, so the medicine chest is the most likely choice. The other options are less likely because they either do not relate to where deodorant is typically stored or because they do not provide enough information to make an informed choice."}

The option \"try to learn\" is the most logical answer because it suggests that the person needs to put in effort and work hard to understand and master the material they are studying. The other options are not as relevant or helpful in improving one's academic performance."}

What might have to be delayed?"}}, "k": "meeting\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is not enough seating for everyone, which implies that a group of people will not be able to comfortably sit together. Of the given options, a meeting is the most likely event that would require seating for a group of people. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Since the ground is the most common surface that objects are placed on, it is also the most common place where shadows appear. The other options might also create shadows, but they are less likely to be the first place someone thinks of when considering where shadows are typically seen."}

Saying \"thank you\" is a common way of showing appreciation, but it is not one of the options given. Smiling and looking for more are not necessarily actions associated with expressing gratitude, so they can be ruled out."}

Dreams are commonly associated with the sleeping mind, which is supported by the phrase \"might dream\" in the answers. Snoring and talking are physical actions that can occur during sleep, but the question is specifically asking about mental activities. Getting cold is a physical sensation and not related to the mind. \"Nothing\" is too vague and does not provide any useful information to help answer the question."}

How did he do so?"}}, "k": "knowingly\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that George intentionally, or \"knowingly,\" ruined the surprise. The other options do not imply intentionality, which is necessary to match the context of the sentence. Hiding, accidentally, and expectation all suggest that George may have stumbled into ruining the surprise. Planned, while it does suggest intentionality, does not match the tense of the sentence."}

This is often associated with the idea of self-improvement, personal growth, and making changes to oneself before trying to make changes in the world. The other options listed do not necessarily relate to this idea, and in some cases may even have a negative effect on creating positive change. For example, riots are usually associated with violence and destruction and may not result in any positive change or solutions."}

Medicine cabinets are typically used for storing medications and other healthcare products, making them a convenient and easily accessible location for birth control pills. The other options, such as \"chemist's shop\" and \"drug store,\" are external locations that would not typically be found in a person's home."}

Out of the given options, only 'body of water' and 'underwater' are related to the habitat of fish. 'Lake Superior' is a specific body of water, but not all fish live in Lake Superior, so it is not the correct answer. 'Toilet' is not a natural body of water, while 'aquarium' is a man-made enclosure where fish are kept in captivity."}

Mosques are religious centers, not necessarily educational ones. While schools are found in many cities, the sentence suggests a specific type of location. Prague is a city, but the sentence does not provide any information about schools in Prague specifically. \"Community\" is too vague and could refer to any type of location."}

This is indicated by the phrase \"open invitation\" and the fact that she \"loved to host.\" The correct answer is therefore likely to relate to hosting or entertaining guests, which is represented by the option \"entertain.\" The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer."}

Plantation is commonly associated with the history of slavery in the Southern United States, where slaves were forced to work in large farms owned by wealthy landowners. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Backpacks are a type of bag, not a place to purchase a notebook. Abraham Lincoln's grave is a historical landmark and not a place to purchase a notebook either. Desktops are computers and not a place to purchase a physical notebook. Classrooms may have notebooks available for purchase, but they are not the primary location for purchasing them."}

The conductor's comment also further supports the idea that the monkey was in a zoo setting, as he jokes about the monkey's \"work\" there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

A shed, which is an outdoor storage structure, is more likely to have spiders than a meadow or a cupboard. A mail box and a cellar are typically indoors, and are less likely to have spiders."}

Rain forests and tree tops are natural habitats for monkeys and they would not be considered captive in these locations. Toy stores and the great outdoors are also unlikely places to find captive monkeys."}

The word \"dangerous\" is the best fit as it directly relates to the consequences of the behavior described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior or its potential consequences."}

In this context, the word \"judge\" makes the most sense as they are the individual who would be responsible for determining whether ignorance is a valid excuse in a court of law. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Learn about subject\" and \"learn new\" are both related to acquiring knowledge, but they do not specifically relate to the legal concept of ignorance as a defense. \"Find truth\" suggests a search for information, but it does not necessarily relate to the concept of ignorance in the legal context. \"Is bliss\" is a common phrase that implies that not knowing something may be better than knowing it, but it does not relate to the context of the sentence."}

This is a commonly-known measurement and is the most logical answer among the options given. The other options do not relate to the context of the question, which is asking about what comprises a yard."}

People who are outgoing tend to seek out new experiences and social opportunities because they enjoy interacting with others. Playfulness may also be a characteristic of an outgoing person, but it is not as strongly associated with the term as seeking new experiences. \"Own house\", \"good looking\", and \"beautiful\" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, it makes sense that this would be the correct answer to the question, as money tends to be used up and eventually disappear. The other answer choices, such as \"flown,\" \"disintegrate,\" and \"fall apart,\" do not accurately describe what happens to money after it is used up. \"Penultimate\" is irrelevant to the question, as it refers to something second-to-last, which does not relate to what happens to money."}

The other options may be important as well, but they do not necessarily represent the primary duty of a parent. \"Care for children\" is a common phrase that encompasses a wide range of responsibilities, including providing for their physical needs, ensuring their safety, nurturing their emotional development, and supporting their education. The other options, such as \"speak freely\" or \"control children,\" do not accurately reflect the primary role of a parent."}

This is a common characteristic of sports games, especially those with high levels of physical activity, such as hockey. Show, theatre, movies and event don't typically involve the same level of vocal participation from the audience, making them less likely to be the correct answer."}

A shopping center typically contains a food court or restaurants, as well as a range of shops selling various goods. The other options do not necessarily offer both food and shopping options in one place, except for a downtown area which might have many different stores and restaurants but is not as specific as a shopping center."}

The other options - company, telephone network, airport, and freeway - do not have any clear relevance to electrical equipment."}

The option \"wrong house\" is a logical choice as it directly relates to the situation described in the sentence. The other options have no clear relevance to the situation of children getting lost while walking home."}

The options \"country\", \"city\", and \"sun\" do not make sense in the context of a government seeking something over its people. \"Trouble\" may be a possibility, but it is not commonly associated with a government's relationship with its citizens. \"Control\", on the other hand, is a frequently used term to describe the power that a government exercises over its people."}

The most logical choice for storage in this context would be a cupboard, which is a type of cabinet that is commonly found in kitchens and used to store various items, including non-perishable food. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as an oven is used for cooking, a grocery store is a place to purchase food, a pantry is a separate room or designated storage area, and a cellar is typically used for storing wine or other perishable goods."}

The option \"countryside\" is more likely to offer such views, as it typically refers to rural areas with open fields, farms, and natural landscapes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some of them (like \"developed land\" or \"atlas\") might even suggest the opposite of scenic beauty."}

Scotland is part of the UK but has its own distinct road network terminology, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Europe is a broad region with many different countries and road systems. A race track is not a type of public road. While New Jersey has highways, the term \"motorway\" is not commonly used in the US."}

The term \"inflation\" refers to a general increase in prices and a decrease in the purchasing value of money. If inflation is not controlled or reduced, it can lead to economic instability, which can manifest as things like recessions, high unemployment rates, and decreased economic growth. The other options, such as \"not noticeable\" and \"eat cake,\" do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence."}

While eating, they discussed their plans for the next ride. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they were talking about having fun on the next ride. The other options, such as heartburn, gas, and food poisoning, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be what the group was discussing."}

Therefore, the most relevant answer choice is \"open boxes.\" The other options do not relate to the task of setting up a classroom, such as \"talking too much\" or \"teaching children,\" which are part of a teacher's regular duties. \"Answering questions\" and \"giving homework\" may also be tasks teachers do, but they don't relate directly to preparing a classroom."}

The other options listed do not typically provide food and tables for customers to eat at. Houses are typically private residences where people live, not places of business. Libraries and conferences are places for learning and networking, respectively, and do not typically provide food and tables for customers.

The other options either do not relate to the act of engaging in small talk or are too broad in their scope to accurately describe this particular behavior."}

The other options do not align with the context of the sentence. A wild ride or massive bear would be unexpected and not indicated by the sentence, and playing marbles or constructing do not relate to the idea of needing rest."}

Given that the sentence mentions the word \"cabinet,\" it is likely that the substance was stored alongside other household items, potentially including medication. The context implies that Sarah was intending to take medicine, and mistakenly ingested poison instead. The other options, such as junk food or nutrient, are not likely to have been stored in a cabinet and would therefore be less likely to be confused with medicine."}

Curiosity may also be felt, but it is more of a desire to learn and understand rather than an emotion. Boredom and fear are less likely to be associated with new experiences, while wonder can be a close second to excitement, but it often implies a sense of awe or amazement, rather than just the thrill of something new."}

Freeways may allow physical travel to another place, but they are not typically referred to as \"connections.\""}

The other choices do not relate to the context of God's view on money."}

Options such as \"office supply store,\" \"friend's house,\" \"desk drawer,\" and \"city hall\" do not seem appropriate for carrying a pen throughout the day. Conversely, a \"pocket\" is a common place to carry small objects such as pens, making it the most logical choice."}

Based on the context of the question, it is likely that the correct answer is a type of meat. Chicken is a common white meat that pairs well with potatoes in many dishes, such as roasted chicken and mashed potatoes or chicken and potato casserole. Tuna, on the other hand, is not typically paired with potatoes in Western cuisine, and the two location options (Maryland and kitchen cupboard) do not provide any clear connection to the question."}

The option \"deaths\" reflects the severity of the situation and the potential danger that the person faces. This option is supported by statistics that show that car accidents can result in fatalities.

The other options don't make sense in this context, as they don't explain why someone would chat during class specifically. \"Necessity\" might make sense if the conversation was related to the class material, but \"answers\" and \"inspiration\" are too specific and unlikely to be the sole reason for chatting. \"Love\" is also unlikely unless the context of the sentence suggests a romantic relationship."}

The options \"supermarket,\" \"cellars,\" and \"grocery store\" are locations and not applicable to the question's context. While water can be used to create a liquid meal, it is unlikely that it would benefit from pepper and salt, making it an unlikely answer. However, soup is a type of liquid meal that is commonly seasoned with pepper and salt to enhance its taste."}

Animal shelters are known for taking in stray animals and providing them with care until they can either be reunited with their owner or adopted by a new family. The other options do not seem like logical places to find a stray dog, as a living room and a dog show would imply that the dog already has an owner, while georgia and pet shops do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices, such as overspending and debt, do not logically follow from the initial statement. Additionally, the natural desire to want to remain in an enjoyable location for as long as possible supports the idea that people who love a vacation spot are more likely to want to stay there."}

The sentence also suggests that the scene is taking place in an aquarium, which is not relevant to any of the other options. \"Card shark\" is a term used to refer to a skilled card player, but it does not give any information about the type of game being played in this sentence. \"Sea world\" and \"shallow waters\" do not have any clear relevance to the context. \"Court room\" may have been a possibility, but the mention of the shark swimming in the background suggests otherwise."}

A grocery store is a place where food is sold, not where animals live. A slaughterhouse is where animals are killed for their meat, so it is also an unlikely option. The countryside is a more plausible option, as it suggests an open space where the heifer can roam free during its last days."}

The only option that fits this description is \"opera.\" At an opera, people watch performers who can move around and use their bodies expressively, but may not actually move around the stage very much. In contrast, the other options involve spaces where there is likely to be more obvious movement, such as a football stadium, car show, or movie theater. Additionally, the surface of the earth does not fit the description at all."}

What's one obvious place people might go to celebrate?"}}, "k": "Disneyland\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the place people might go to celebrate would have rides, which is commonly associated with amusement parks such as Disneyland. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Biologists often track the movements of marine animals in the open ocean using satellite tracking or acoustic tags, so it is reasonable to assume that they found the shark in the open ocean. The other options do not make as much sense based on the context of the sentence."}

She isn't in a heavily populated area.  Where might she live?"}}, "k": "jewish community\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Lilly's deli is located in an area where there may be a significant Jewish population, as kosher food is specific to Jewish dietary laws. Therefore, it is likely that Lilly would live in or near a Jewish community. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options are not typically associated with carrying shopping bags, and therefore, do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The only choice that relates directly to the context is legal fees, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as free time, pleasure, or being lonely, do not have any clear connection to the sentence's context."}

The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - a fresh fruit typically does not need to be chopped up, a wine press is not used to chop fruit, a fruit basket is for presenting whole fruits, and a picnic basket could contain a variety of items, not necessarily chopped fruit."}

A music store, on the other hand, is a place where one could expect to find a large number of fiddles for sale, including rare and collectible models. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

It was overkill.  What did he shoot at?"}}, "k": "ungulate\nKnowledge: The word \"ungulate\" refers to a large mammal that has hooves, such as deer, elk or moose. The sentence suggests that James used a cannon to shoot at an animal while he was looking for lunch. The word \"overkill\" implies that his choice of weapon was excessive or unnecessary. Given this information, the most logical answer would be \"ungulate\" since it is a type of animal that is commonly hunted for food. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - for example, it is illegal to kill people or bombers with a cannon, and body armor does not typically require a cannon to penetrate."}

Where might he spend most of his time today?"}}, "k": "library\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James needs to work on his report before it is due tomorrow. The most likely place for him to do that work is in a space where he has access to resources like books, research materials, and a quiet place to work. The library is the most appropriate choice out of the given options, as it fits these criteria. The university and college class options are too broad, and the classroom option is not specific enough to indicate where James might work on his report."}

Populated areas are likely to have a higher concentration of theaters due to the availability of an audience and potential customers. Schools, military bases, and churches may have a theater but are not likely to have multiple theaters. An opera house may have a theater, but it is a specific type of theater and not the general location being asked for in the question."}

Tying one's shoelace is a common safety measure when engaging in physical activity to prevent falls and accidents. The other options do not offer a logical explanation for why the person's escape was cut short."}

The phrase \"thank someone\" suggests that gratitude is a key component of the answer. Options like \"smile\", \"shake hands\", and \"say you're welcome\" are polite responses, but do not directly address the issue of expressing gratitude. \"Appreciate compliment\" is a similar phrase to \"thank someone\", but it is not an action that can be taken, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "37df76da99ea7f3bce02f8882abe4fac", "question": {"question_concept": "broken glass", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "bridge"}, {"label": "B", "text": "in spain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "field"}, {"label": "E", "text": "street"}], "stem": "The window of the Honda was hit from the inside, not the outside. Where was most of the the broken glass found?"}}, "k": "inside the car\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the glass was broken from the inside of the car. Therefore, the broken glass would be found inside the car, not outside. This eliminates all of the options except for \"inside the car.\" The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "457500ce2c0634a036329a8c2f27fe6c", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "eat fish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "they steal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "talk to each other"}, {"label": "D", "text": "write stories"}, {"label": "E", "text": "die of starvation"}], "stem": "What happens to people when they do not have enough food?"}}, "k": "die of starvation\nKnowledge: The question asks about the consequences of not having enough food, and the phrase \"not having enough food\" commonly refers to a lack of sustenance that leads to malnutrition and eventual death if left unchecked. Eating fish or talking to each other are not necessarily relevant to the question and do not address the serious consequences of malnutrition. \"They steal\" may be a possible consequence of people not having enough food, but it is not as severe or certain as dying of starvation. Writing stories does not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

The context of the sentence suggests that these tools are used during an evening activity, and the most common evening activity involving eating utensils is dinner. The other options (backpack, closet, drawer, cupboard) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Textbooks are written to provide a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts, including operations with numbers, and are designed to be used both in the classroom and for independent study. The other options, such as phonebooks, statistics or music schools, have no relevance to the subject of operations with numbers."}

The term \"pollination\" indicates that the creatures are likely insects or animals that help to transfer pollen from one flower to another, and butterflies are well-known for their role in pollination as well as their beauty and popularity among nature-lovers. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "ef1cf027032a40267bc106490c843040", "question": {"question_concept": "lying", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "ordering dog food online"}, {"label": "B", "text": "avoid eye contact"}, {"label": "C", "text": "feel guilty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fall asleep"}, {"label": "E", "text": "blush"}], "stem": "What is a common sign that someone is lying?"}}, "k": "avoid eye contact\nKnowledge: Avoiding eye contact is a common sign that someone may be lying. This is because the person may feel uncomfortable or nervous about lying and making direct eye contact can reveal their deception. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "67bade299baeab3858ded976a3c51026", "question": {"question_concept": "competing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "friendship"}, {"label": "B", "text": "aggression"}, {"label": "C", "text": "defeat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "winning or losing"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sweat"}], "stem": "The friends loved competing against one another, it was a good way to work their what?"}}, "k": "friendship\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends enjoyed competing against each other, which implies that they viewed the competition as a positive activity. The word \"work\" suggests that there was a benefit or positive outcome associated with the competition. Given the positive connotation of the sentence, the best choice is \"friendship\" because it implies that the competition strengthened the bond between the friends. The other options have negative connotations that are not supported by the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "f3a9bd7f2ba8762d319cc2f9b772a14a", "question": {"question_concept": "stars", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "outer space"}, {"label": "B", "text": "night sky"}, {"label": "C", "text": "universe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "orbit"}, {"label": "E", "text": "the ground"}], "stem": "james loved the stars.  In the wilderness, they lit up what?"}}, "k": "night sky\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoyed looking at the stars and that they illuminated something in the wilderness. The options \"outer space,\" \"universe,\" and \"orbit\" are all related to space, but they do not relate to the context of the sentence. \"The ground\" is also unlikely as stars do not typically illuminate the ground. \"Night sky\" is the most likely answer as it refers to the area of the sky that is visible at night and would be where James could observe the stars lighting up the darkness."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "2cd6f1a94d123b352918b2f2c1c79059", "question": {"question_concept": "watch tv", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "have tv"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fall asleep"}, {"label": "C", "text": "learn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sitting"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dancing"}], "stem": "Deciding to watch tv or play with your cell phone might be a routine but they provide no help in being able to do what?"}}, "k": "learn\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that watching TV or playing with a cell phone is a routine activity, but it does not help in achieving a certain goal. The other options like \"having TV\", \"falling asleep\", \"sitting\", or \"dancing\" are not related to the idea of achieving a goal or acquiring new knowledge. Hence, the correct answer could be \"learn\" as watching TV or playing with a cell phone does not contribute to one's learning or knowledge acquisition."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "6f110cc0e6380cdbefe0816c3e19d2bd", "question": {"question_concept": "creativity", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sew"}, {"label": "B", "text": "create art"}, {"label": "C", "text": "express yourself"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sing and dance"}, {"label": "E", "text": "write"}], "stem": "Everybody has a little bit of creativity, but only a few lucky ones get to do what for a living?"}}, "k": "create art\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that only a selected few are able to turn their creativity into a profession. Creating art is a well-known career path for artists, painters, illustrators, and other kinds of creators who utilize their creativity to produce unique and aesthetically pleasing pieces of work. The other options may involve creativity, but they don't necessarily connote a profession. For example, sewing can just be a hobby for someone, whereas writing can be a profession for journalists, reporters or authors, but not necessarily a creative one."}

The options \"turn away,\" \"let down,\" \"have to sleep,\" and \"run\" do not have any clear connection to human-powered transportation. However, a row boat is commonly understood to be a type of watercraft that is propelled by oars, which are operated by a person's physical effort."}

Smiling, sweating, acting, and dancing can all be enjoyed by deaf individuals as they do not rely on the ability to hear. Singing, on the other hand, involves creating and hearing sound, which deaf individuals would not be able to enjoy."}

This feeling of frustration is commonly associated with anger, as the person may feel that their time is being wasted or that they are not being treated fairly. The other options, such as order or queueing up, do not accurately reflect the emotional state of the person in the situation described. Wait turn and fatigue may also be common emotions experienced when standing in line but are not the most appropriate choices based on the sentence structure."}

He's putting on waterproof trunks and goggles.  What sort of facility is he most likely visiting?"}}, "k": "swimming pool\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence describes Bob putting on clothing and accessories commonly worn when swimming, such as waterproof trunks and goggles.

The most logical answer from the given choices would be \"do work,\" as this implies that the computers in the cubicles are used for productivity and completing job-related tasks. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or do not fit with the function of an office setting."}

It is not practical or sanitary to store dirt in fingernails, a corner, or a computer. Storing dirt in a closet could also be problematic as it could potentially damage clothing or other items stored there."}

A flea market is a common place for collectors to find unique and rare items, making it a likely choice for where the person may have acquired their collector items. None of the other options provide a logical connection to the context of the sentence."}

It also suggests that the method of transportation is expensive, which rules out options like trucks and trains that are generally more affordable. The only option that meets both criteria is an airplane, which is known for its speed and high cost of operation."}

The statement in the question describes a star with eight planets orbiting it, which matches the definition of a solar system. The other options, such as hollywood, night sky, constellation, and aliens, do not relate to the concept of a star with planets orbiting it."}

The phrase \"step forward\" implies that the speaker is looking for a willing volunteer to offer assistance. The other options do not relate to the request for help with milking a cow."}

The options \"fairgrounds\" and \"friend's house\" do not fit the context because they are not vehicles. The options \"oven\" and \"microwave\" are household appliances and do not relate to transportation. Therefore, the correct answer is \"space shuttle,\" which is a vehicle used for space travel and requires freeze-dried food due to weight restrictions and preservation needs."}

Socializing with others is a well-established way to cope with loneliness and can provide a sense of connection and belonging. Meeting people or making friends can also be helpful, but these options may take more time and effort. Making people laugh or drinking liquor may provide temporary relief, but they are not sustainable solutions for coping with loneliness."}

The phrase \"start menu\" typically refers to the button on the desktop screen that allows the user to access various options, including shutting down or restarting the computer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "d91afc3870c44019dd237ea80e2c386e", "question": {"question_concept": "chatting with friends", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "giggle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lie"}, {"label": "C", "text": "laughing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "chuckle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "smoke"}], "stem": "What does someone chatting with friends do when they hear a joke?"}}, "k": "giggle\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person heard a joke and responded in some way. The word \"chatting\" implies a casual, social situation. The answer can be found by process of elimination: \"lie\" and \"smoke\" do not make sense in this context. \"Laughing\" and \"chuckle\" are similar in meaning to \"giggle,\" but \"giggle\" specifically suggests a light, playful laugh, which is often how people respond to jokes in a social setting."}

These items are often used for storage and may not be opened frequently, allowing clothing to accumulate inside. The options of a drawer, book shelf or washing machine do not provide a likely location for old clothing."}

Therefore, \"acute angled\" is the option that is logically contradictory to \"obtuse.\" The other options may or may not be related to \"obtuse,\" but they do not form a clear logical opposite."}

While all the answer choices are related to the concept of learning, the most appropriate option is \"intelligence,\" which refers to a person's ability to reason, understand complex ideas, and solve problems. The other choices are either redundant (e.g., \"education\" and \"gaining knowledge\") or insufficient (e.g., \"get to know\") in capturing the meaning conveyed by the sentence."}

The phrase \"cashing in\" reinforces this idea by suggesting the artist wanted to make money. The term \"selling out\" specifically refers to compromising one's artistic integrity in exchange for financial gain, which is a common criticism artists face when they become too commercial. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "7f4f5b8d4fff666a075b891774ce7617", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "come home"}, {"label": "B", "text": "airplane"}, {"label": "C", "text": "learn from each other"}, {"label": "D", "text": "go out"}, {"label": "E", "text": "make art"}], "stem": "Sam didn't like the people he met while traveling.  What might he do to get away from them?"}}, "k": "go out\nKnowledge: The phrase \"get away from them\" suggests that Sam wants to physically distance himself from the people he met while traveling. Of the available options, \"go out\" is the only one that could potentially facilitate this action. \"Come home\" would bring Sam even closer to the people he wants to avoid, \"airplane\" may be a mode of transportation but it doesn't necessarily help Sam escape from the people he doesn't like, \"learn from each other\" suggests a desire to engage with the people he didn't like, and \"make art\" is completely unrelated to the situation presented in the question."}

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no indication of pain or disinterest."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "fd717fb343e56caa486b230bc6468991", "question": {"question_concept": "illegitimate", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "actions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "legal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "authentic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "logical"}, {"label": "E", "text": "legitimate"}], "stem": "Illegitimate designer handbags will not have a certificate of what?"}}, "k": "authentic\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a way to identify illegitimate designer handbags, and one of those ways is through the absence of a certificate. The word \"authentic\" refers to something that is real or genuine, so it makes sense that illegitimate designer handbags would not have an authentic certificate. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

Michigan is a state that is shaped like a mitten, resembling a glove, and it is known for having a significant amount of farmland. The other choices do not match the description given in the question."}

The most common type of furniture used for this purpose is a filing cabinet, which typically has multiple drawers specifically designed to hold folders and files. While a desk may have a drawer that could be used for this purpose, it is not typically used for storing large quantities of paper files."}

However, it is considered disrespectful and illegal to conduct excavation in a cemetery. This knowledge is based on cultural and legal norms that dictate how human remains should be treated and protected. Therefore, among the given options, the only place that excavation should never take place is a cemetery."}

Nebraska is a state known for its large corn production, making it a likely location for a steakhouse with such a view. The other options do not have a strong association with corn or steakhouse dining."}

Going to jail is a common punishment for committing arson, which involves setting fire to property on purpose. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "65a2cfde53758c9a4390766c02bde8cc", "question": {"question_concept": "marijuana", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "entertainment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "neat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "happy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "intoxicating"}, {"label": "E", "text": "illegal"}], "stem": "Having your marijuana in bags help keep it what?"}}, "k": "neat\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that keeping marijuana in bags can assist with maintaining a specific quality or condition. Keeping marijuana in bags can help preserve its freshness and prevent it from becoming stale or dry. Knowing this, it's clear that the correct answer is \"neat\", because all of the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "1d78a458fe91ed92112773c252910e21", "question": {"question_concept": "statue", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "church"}, {"label": "B", "text": "theatre"}, {"label": "C", "text": "large city"}, {"label": "D", "text": "water fountain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "central park"}], "stem": "What kind of place could have thousands of statue?"}}, "k": "central park\nKnowledge: A place that could have thousands of statues would need to be large enough to accommodate them, and would likely be a public space where people can enjoy the sculptures. Central Park in New York City has over 900 statues, monuments, and sculptures, making it a prime contender for the correct answer. The other options do not have as much space or significance as Central Park."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "4eb66c10b493c5fdd4b979846e898f89", "question": {"question_concept": "horse", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "race track"}, {"label": "B", "text": "kentucky derby"}, {"label": "C", "text": "american southwest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "triple crown"}, {"label": "E", "text": "horse derby"}], "stem": "Everybody seemed to have a horse not just the regular gamblers, which event always brings out the biggest crowds to the sport?"}}, "k": "race track\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that horse racing is the sport being referred to, as it mentions \"gamblers\" and \"horse.\" The use of the phrase \"not just the regular gamblers\" suggests that there may be some special event or circumstance that is causing more people than usual to have horses, and therefore more people than usual are attending the sport. Of the choices given, only \"race track\" directly relates to horse racing, while the other options either refer to specific races (such as the Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown) or are general regions (such as the American Southwest) that do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence."}

This may involve basic first aid techniques or using items in the environment to create makeshift medical supplies. The other options do not provide any help or assistance with the situation described in the sentence."}

This process is known as an initial public offering (IPO) and allows the company to raise funds by selling shares to investors. Going public is often seen as a way to access more funding, as the company can use the funds raised through the IPO to finance its operations and future growth. The other options do not have a clear relationship to the context of a company going public."}

The description of the human's expression as \"longingly\" suggests they are missing something or yearning for it. The phrase \"surface of earth\" most accurately reflects what the human may be missing while they are in the artificial environment of the space station. The other answer options do not relate to the context of the sentence."}

Picture is not a state and does not fit the parameters of the question. Pennsylvania is known to have several mountain ranges, including the Appalachian Mountains, making it a likely choice for the correct answer."}

Where might he be?"}}, "k": "house\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence is that Sam left his muddy shoes in the entryway, which suggests that he went into a building, not an open space like a garden or a department store. The options of school and office building are also plausible, but the use of the word \"entryway\" implies a residential setting rather than a professional or educational one."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "30d5b111ebacc5f48f7b896ce85dcc2d", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "drink tea"}, {"label": "B", "text": "thank god"}, {"label": "C", "text": "open eyes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "feel angry"}, {"label": "E", "text": "complete sentence"}], "stem": "What would a person do if he or she just woke up?"}}, "k": "open eyes\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person just woke up, which means their eyes are likely closed.

It is designed to be applied to the armpits in order to prevent body odor, which indicates that option 3, \"armpits,\" is not correct as it is not a location where deodorant can be purchased. The other two options, \"medicine cabinet\" and \"medicine chest,\" refer to storage units for medications and are not retail locations where products can be purchased. Option 5, \"kitchen,\" is also not correct as it is not generally a location where personal hygiene products are sold."}

A pencil is not used for printing as it leaves a mark by removing graphite from the pencil lead, while a newspaper and printer are output devices rather than input devices. A squid, while capable of ejecting ink, is not a tool for printing text or images in a human context. A fountain pen, on the other hand, is filled with ink and used to produce clean, consistent lines on paper, making it a suitable answer."}

They are often placed on tables, particularly in dimly lit rooms or at night, to provide additional light and add to the ambiance.

He had a hangup.  He didn't like to be what?"}}, "k": "naked\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not enjoy having sex or engaging in sexual activities. Specifically, he had a \"hangup\" about being naked, which implies that he may have felt uncomfortable or self-conscious when unclothed. The other options are all related to sexual activity, but do not specifically address the issue of nudity or John's discomfort with being naked."}

Marmosets are non-flying animals and do not typically burrow underground, but they are known to live in the wilderness and could potentially be found in Colorado. However, there is no reason why a marmoset would be associated with a dictionary, making it the correct answer."}

It's possible that the child may laugh or feel happy while playing, but that's not what the question is asking. The sentence mentions that the child is \"going\" to play, which implies movement, so it's more likely that the child will walk slowly towards his destination rather than sit still or run."}

The phrase \"upper hand\" is commonly used to describe having an advantage or being in control of a situation, whereas the other options do not necessarily connote an advantage in a competition. \"Determination\" and \"skill\" may contribute to a person's success, but they do not necessarily indicate that the person has already achieved an advantage over others. \"Superior\" and \"higher position\" are also possible answers, but \"upper hand\" is a more natural fit for the context of the question."}

The most likely location for this would be an office. The other options, such as a building, library, or table, are too general and do not specifically indicate a workspace. The option of a bathtub is also clearly not the correct answer, as it is not a logical location for a chair meant for receiving visitors."}

The attic may be not ideal since it often gets hot and sunlight can damage the wine. Art show and church are not related to wine storage in any way. A bar may store wine, but it may not be the best option for long-term storage as they may not have a controlled environment."}

He did so because he was feeling what?"}}, "k": "agony\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John's motivation for spending a lot of money on products for his swollen testicles was not enjoyment, but rather pain. The word \"agony\" indicates that John was probably experiencing considerable discomfort from his swollen testicles, which led him to seek relief through various products. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence."}

This implies that his mental capacity is unaffected by his disability. The options \"strength\", \"potential\", \"qualification\", and \"competence\" are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not suggest any connection to his mental capacity."}

The State of the Union address is a major speech given by the President of the United States in the capital, in which they discuss the state of the country and outline their legislative agenda for the coming year. The Gettysburg Address is a famous speech delivered by President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, but it is not given annually and does not take place in the capital. The other options (each state, each country, Europe) are not related to the context of the question."}

The most likely place for children's things in the home would be the \"own home\" option. \"Cupboard\" and \"cabinet\" are too specific and do not necessarily imply the presence of children. \"Everything\" is a vague option that does not fit the context. \"Garbage dump\" is clearly not a realistic option in this context."}

To have an \"edge\" in this context means having an advantage or superiority over the competition, which is what people typically look for when competing against others. The other options may be relevant in other contexts, but they do not fully capture the essence of competition as described in the question."}

California is a state known for its water shortages and droughts, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not provide any information about their location, and the mention of first floor suggests that the sentence may not be referring to an outdoor swimming pool."}

This would likely lead to feelings of isolation, as they may no longer have the same social support network that they had before the divorce. Grief might also be a possible response, as the end of a significant relationship can be emotional, but this would not necessarily apply to everyone in this situation. Pleasure and happiness are unlikely responses given the context of being abandoned, and \"solo\" is not a feeling in itself, but rather a description of being alone."}

The choices \"efficiency,\" \"getting work done,\" and \"finishing up\" do not relate to this context, while \"results\" is too vague to be a likely answer. Therefore, \"marriage\" is the correct option."}

The clue \"three quarters\" suggests a large proportion, which eliminates options like beach that only cover a small strip of land. The most logical answer is the surface of earth, since the earth is mostly covered by water and the ocean is the largest body of water on earth."}

Compliments and caring about others may also lead to being approached, but not necessarily by a lot of people. Knowing all and understanding oneself are not related to the context of being approached by others."}

Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a word that has a positive connotation and implies a skill or ability. \"Fun\" and \"learn about\" are not directly related to the woman's ability to entertain, while \"intelligence\" and \"recognize\" are not appropriate choices since they do not match the context of the sentence. \"Talent\" is the best answer as it suggests a natural ability or aptitude for a particular activity, which fits with the woman's knack for entertaining."}

The options pocket, shower, chemist, and drug store are unlikely places to store a razor, as they are not designed for razor storage. A shaving kit, on the other hand, is a specifically designed container for razor storage and other shaving supplies, making it the most likely option for storing a double edge razor."}

The other options may have chairs in them, but do not necessarily involve the specific layout or purpose of a theater."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "8331541ce82d72e0059e3151009b50c8", "question": {"question_concept": "chess pawn", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "chess set"}, {"label": "B", "text": "strategy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "toy store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "chess game"}, {"label": "E", "text": "small case"}], "stem": "If I wanted to store my chess pawn when I wasn't using it, what would be a good place for that?"}}, "k": "small case\nKnowledge: The question asks for a place to store a chess pawn, suggesting that it needs to be some type of container or case. Out of the choices given, small case is the only one that fits this criteria. A chess set typically contains multiple pieces and doesn't provide individual storage for each piece, while strategy and chess game are not physical places to store a pawn. A toy store is also not a viable option as it is a location to purchase items rather than store them."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "7ebb387386ea07a40069842584c446d5", "question": {"question_concept": "buy presents for others", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "go shopping"}, {"label": "B", "text": "generous"}, {"label": "C", "text": "earn money"}, {"label": "D", "text": "have money"}, {"label": "E", "text": "gift buyer"}], "stem": "If you're known to buy presents for others often you would be called what?"}}, "k": "generous\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person is known for buying presents for others frequently. Buying gifts for others is often seen as an act of generosity, indicating that the correct answer is \"generous.\" The other options are not applicable to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "62443afea6ccdccacb238a52e9a0a7ed", "question": {"question_concept": "anemone", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "michigan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tide pool"}, {"label": "D", "text": "nursery"}, {"label": "E", "text": "atlantic ocean"}], "stem": "There aren't many anemone in what glove-shaped state?"}}, "k": "lake\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a shape similar to that of a glove and is also known for its lack of anemone. This eliminates choices like Michigan (not glove-shaped), tide pool (not a state), and Atlantic Ocean (not glove-shaped and too large for the context of the sentence). Nurseries are also not typically associated with anemone. This leaves the option Lake as the correct answer as it is both shaped like a glove and can be a habitat for anemone."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "9820ffd80502ef5cd4591038905f956f", "question": {"question_concept": "keys", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "front pocket"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cabinet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "purse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "chain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "piano"}], "stem": "The keys were black and white, what were they attached to?"}}, "k": "piano\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the keys are black and white, which is a common color scheme for piano keys. Therefore, the keys were most likely attached to a piano. The other options do not have any clear relationship to the context of the sentence."}

The clue to the correct answer is in the phrase \"school together\" which means that the fish are swimming in a group with coordinated movement patterns. Fish are known to school together for protection and to increase their chances of finding food, which makes this option the most logical choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

In order to effectively manage a project, it is important to have knowledge about the subject matter at hand, as well as relevant skills and experience. Greed and worry are not traits that are typically associated with effective project management. \"Take charge\" and \"boss\" suggest a more authoritarian style of leadership, which may not be necessary or effective in all project management situations."}

The other options, such as getting tired or skipping, do not relate to the fundamental requirement of having functioning legs. Additionally, being not fat or looking first do not directly contribute to the ability to physically run after a ball."}

This is commonly known as an airplane graveyard or boneyard. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question - \"war\" and \"crash\" could refer to situations where airplanes are used or damaged, while \"aircraft carrier\" and \"sky\" do not provide any information about where unused airplanes might be found."}

The phrase \"kept her leg bouncing\" also suggests a repetitive movement, which is similar to the motion of operating a spinning wheel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

An apartment, school, office, or house could all technically have a desk, so they are unlikely to be the correct answer. A table, on the other hand, is a piece of furniture that can be found in various locations and can serve as an alternative to a desk."}

Candy stores typically sell candy, sweets, and treats over a counter, making it the most likely option for the correct answer. The other options (butcher shop, kitchen, auto repair shop, post office) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Water and liquid are too broad and do not convey negative consequences. Foamy and intoxicating do not accurately reflect the negative consequences associated with long term beer consumption."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "401538812fa5336900c867792b4a08cc", "question": {"question_concept": "going to sleep", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "loss of consciousness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "relaxation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "snoring"}, {"label": "D", "text": "dreaming"}, {"label": "E", "text": "talking"}], "stem": "When going to sleep what noise does a human make?"}}, "k": "None of the above.\nKnowledge: The question does not specify that a human makes any noise when going to sleep, which rules out options like snoring and talking. While a person may experience relaxation or loss of consciousness, those are not really \"noises\" they make. Dreaming also does not typically involve any audible sounds. Therefore, the correct answer is \"None of the above.\""}

The term \"wallflower\" is often used to describe someone who is shy or introverted and tends to stay on the sidelines at social gatherings, while the other options either contradict or do not provide any meaningful information within the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "45bf78f9483e86477920d89dc5389383", "question": {"question_concept": "laundry room", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "house"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hotel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "green house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "college"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dorm"}], "stem": "Where could you find a laundry room that is only used by staff?"}}, "k": "hotel\nKnowledge: The mention of a laundry room only used by staff implies that it is a part of a larger establishment rather than a single residence, such as a hotel or maybe even a hospital or office building. The other options do not have a clear need for a laundry room that is separate from the main area."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "3bfa1ea847af67249c67a9fb0bdd0c1b", "question": {"question_concept": "beaver", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "wooded area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "body of water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the ocean"}, {"label": "D", "text": "british columbia"}, {"label": "E", "text": "zoo"}], "stem": "Where does a beaver leave?"}}, "k": "body of water\nKnowledge: Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water, such as streams, rivers, and ponds. They create a habitat for themselves in and around the body of water, which is why it is most likely that they leave in this environment. The other options, such as a zoo or a specific region like British Columbia, do not have a clear connection to the natural environment of beavers. Wooded areas may be near bodies of water, but the question specifically asks where a beaver leaves, suggesting that there is a specific destination in mind."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "93f37a3cabe0c30c0cad59bdf19f9400", "question": {"question_concept": "village", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rural area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "ohio"}, {"label": "D", "text": "big city"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tribe"}], "stem": "What is the opposite of a village?"}}, "k": "big city\nKnowledge: A village is typically a small, rural community, so the opposite would be a large, urban area. The term \"big city\" is commonly used to describe densely populated urban centers with a lot of cultural, economic, and social activity. The other options may be related to rural areas or communities, but do not necessarily represent the opposite of a village."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "d3e112c52e8dfcb2cabf13f1a2c95042", "question": {"question_concept": "living life", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "joy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "valuable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "happiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "early death"}, {"label": "E", "text": "adventurous"}], "stem": "What does someone living life fully feel?"}}, "k": "It could be any of the first four choices depending on the context of the sentence or situation described. It is unlikely that \"early death\" would be an answer that would help someone choose the correct option. In general, those living life fully are likely to experience positive feelings such as joy, happiness, and a sense of value or fulfillment."}

The other options, such as east side, countryside, middle america, and Georgia, do not necessarily convey the same visual imagery or context. Additionally, the use of the word \"plain\" suggests a simplicity or lack of complexity, which is again commonly associated with landscapes."}

The other choices, such as playing cards or chess or reading newspapers, may provide entertainment or engagement for some people but they are not activities typically associated with television. Surfing the net is also a possibility, but the sentence specifically mentions television."}

It also implies that this location is not the ocean. The options \"pond\", \"swimming pool\", and \"children's pool\" are not likely to have a beach or shallow water. \"Bathe in\" is a vague phrase and can apply to any body of water. Therefore, the most logical and likely answer is \"lake\"."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "4902e673e60bfa56600691afa5f83ab9", "question": {"question_concept": "playing violin", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "happiness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "relaxation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "create music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sadness"}, {"label": "E", "text": "loud noises"}], "stem": "What would happen to you if you are not good at playing violin?"}}, "k": "sadness\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that not being good at playing the violin would have a negative impact on a person. It suggests that the person may feel sadness as a result of their inability to play the instrument well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "86ebd3dab56e7656f14982638117a36e", "question": {"question_concept": "cabbage", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "grocery store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "refrigerator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "freezer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "plate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "supermarket"}], "stem": "Wanting to avoid the cabbage spoiling, where did he put it?"}}, "k": "refrigerator\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person wanted to preserve the cabbage for later use, which suggests that they would have stored it in a cooler environment. The most obvious option is the refrigerator since it is commonly used to keep food fresh for a longer period of time. The freezer is also a possibility, but it may affect the texture of the cabbage. The other options, such as the grocery store or supermarket, are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "7e953a4fa00de97f45aa91504ca37786", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "pay bills"}, {"label": "B", "text": "swap bodies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "learn from each other"}, {"label": "D", "text": "believe in god"}, {"label": "E", "text": "talk to each other"}], "stem": "If people listen, they can understand each other better.  If they understand each other, they can do what?"}}, "k": "learn from each other\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that listening to each other can lead to better understanding, which in turn suggests that people can share knowledge and insights with each other. \"Swap bodies\" and \"believe in god\" are not logical outcomes of improved communication or understanding. \"Pay bills\" and \"talk to each other\" do not necessarily require a deeper level of understanding or knowledge-sharing between people."}

They are not typically found in museums, hospitals, desks, or opera houses. However, zoos often have exhibits that showcase different species of animals, including zebras. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be \"zoo.\""}

He never meant to damage what?"}}, "k": "curtains\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John is feeling guilty for breaking something by accident that was located across the street from him. Since the only option related to something that could be located across the street is curtains, this suggests that John accidentally broke someone's curtains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Giving someone forgiveness typically results in them feeling a sense of relief and release from guilt or shame. Redemption and absolution both have religious connotations and are not necessarily a direct result of someone forgiving another person. Isolation and \"feeling better\" are not directly related to forgiveness either."}

A dumpster or trashcan may be used to collect trash, but it is eventually taken to a landfill or similar facility for disposal. Television and Fox News have no clear connection to the context of the question."}

This means that the judge will decide the appropriate punishment for the crime that was committed. The other choices do not accurately describe the role of a judge after a conviction. A judge does not conduct a trial, as the trial has already been completed. They do not make an arrest, as that is the job of law enforcement. While a judge does bring in a verdict, that happens before the conviction. \"Serve justice\" is a vague answer that could apply to any number of actions a judge may take, but is not specific to what they do after a conviction."}

This scenario is commonly associated with college or university campuses, where security guards often patrol the grounds in golf carts to ensure the safety of students. The other options, such as concert venues or airports, do not typically use golf carts as a means of security transportation, and the reference to young adults suggests an educational setting."}

While it is possible to install flooring in a loft or any other locations, the most common place to install flooring is in a house.

They only rise up in what sort of spaces?"}}, "k": "populated area\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that numbers are essential for the existence of society, which implies a connection to human populations.

He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying?"}}, "k": "motel\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John was looking for a cheap and basic accommodation option. A motel is typically a budget-friendly lodging option that offers few amenities compared to a hotel. Farms, towns, and cities do not necessarily have an association with inexpensive lodgings, and a hotel typically offers more luxurious amenities than what John was looking for."}

The use of \"not happy\" suggests that the person may be reluctant or unhappy about the idea of taking their car to any of the listed locations, further indicating that \"down a river\" is the correct answer option."}

This implies that he needed to have enough space in his living quarters to accommodate the instrument. The other options, such as a band or music room, would be places specifically designed for instruments and would not have been mentioned in this way. Additionally, college and university do not provide any indication of where Bill lived, as he could have lived on or off campus."}

This is a common feature of orchestras, which typically consist of a wide variety of instruments. Symphony orchestras and chamber orchestras are both types of orchestras, but the other options (band, create music, and string quartet) do not typically feature a large variety of instruments."}

Being charming means that a person is likeable and pleasant, which can be useful when trying to gain someone's trust. The other options have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of the sentence."}

Maps can help passengers locate their destination, find nearby landmarks, and plan their route. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - a lottery ticket, for example, would not be found at a bus station and does not provide any practical assistance."}

While grapes may also be used in fruit cocktails or as a snack in a picnic basket, these options do not specifically reference the use of small grapes or suggest that they would be used in a wine press. Juices are typically made from a variety of fruits, not just grapes. Kitchens may also be a place for preparing grapes, but again, the sentence specifically references the use of small grapes, which have a specific purpose."}

Panic is a common reaction to such rumors, as people may feel threatened and unsure of how to protect themselves. The other options do not seem to fit well with the context of the sentence. Getting in trouble, going to prison, and committing murder are all unrelated to the situation at hand, while mass hysteria is a potential consequence of panic rather than a possible answer to the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "7fa4e9f9d5c1d2a071388428c3aa8186", "question": {"question_concept": "remembering", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "problems"}, {"label": "B", "text": "crying"}, {"label": "C", "text": "inspiration"}, {"label": "D", "text": "trauma"}, {"label": "E", "text": "nightmares"}], "stem": "Remembering past successe is likely to cause what?"}}, "k": "inspiration\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering past successes is likely to have a positive effect, which may inspire or motivate the person. It is common for people to look back on their accomplishments for inspiration when they are facing new challenges. The other options do not fit the context, as problems, crying, trauma, and nightmares are more negative outcomes that are not typically associated with reflecting on past successes."}

While some of the options (such as roman architecture, whitehouse, bridge, and pantheon) may be associated with columns in a literal sense, none of them are relevant to the context of the sentence. A spreadsheet, however, is a tool commonly used for organizing and manipulating data in columns and rows, which makes it the most likely answer."}

Additionally, the mention of \"on the grass\" suggests that the person is outdoors, which rules out the movie theater. While soccer games may have concessions, they are typically played on a field or stadium, not on grass. The countryside and state park options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

When people have to wait for something for a long time, they might start to feel restless, tired, or uninterested, which can result in boredom. The other options do not reflect a common experience associated with waiting, except for worry, which may sometimes occur but is not the best fit for the sentence."}

Out of the provided options, \"office\" is the most likely answer as many offices have windows to let in natural light and provide a view of the outdoors. \"Wall,\" \"front door,\" and \"tent\" are unlikely to have lots of windows, while \"space shuttle\" does have windows, but it is not considered a corner area."}

Sign language is a visual language that involves communicating through hand gestures and body movements, which would allow the person being helped to express themselves even if they cannot speak clearly. The other options do not relate to helping someone who cannot speak coherently."}

The phrase \"conquer opponent\" fits this context, as it suggests a strategic goal of defeating the enemy and gaining control over their territory. The other options either focus solely on fighting or are not relevant to the context of war."}

The word \"unnecessary\" fits this meaning exactly. The other choices do not convey the same meaning. \"Satisfied\" refers to a feeling of contentment, not the object itself. \"Luxury\" suggests something that is not essential, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not needed. \"Sufficient\" means there is enough of something, but it does not convey a sense of necessity or lack of necessity. \"Extra\" also suggests something additional or surplus, but it does not necessarily imply that it is not needed."}

One plausible location for gun evidence to be sent is the police station, where it can be analyzed by ballistics experts to determine if it was used in a particular crime. The other options do not make much sense – returning the gun to its owner or putting it in a drawer would not help with the investigation, and leaving it at the crime scene or in a holster would contaminate the evidence."}

The bible is a holy book that contains passages and teachings that are meant to be read by believers, but it is not customary to write in the bible itself. The other options do not involve written texts that are traditionally read but not written by the reader, making them less likely to be the correct answer."}

An apartment or furniture store may have armchairs that are used by a variety of people, so they are unlikely options. A doctor's office or hospital may have armchairs that are used by many people on a daily basis, making them unlikely options as well. A study is a room that is often used by only a few people, making it the most likely answer."}

What tool should I use to fix this?"}}, "k": "humidifier\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the house is lacking humidity, which can be increased by introducing more moisture into the air. A humidifier is a device designed to add moisture to the air, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as the surface of the earth or a skating rink, have no relevance to the issue at hand. The option \"burn it to the ground\" is clearly not a reasonable solution."}

The option of lay eggs is also eliminated as humans do not lay eggs. This leaves us with the option of two ears, which is a universal feature among all humans located on the side of their head. The option of one head is irrelevant as it is not a distinguishing feature among humans."}

While it is possible to hear a harpsichord in other settings, such as a museum exhibit or a performance by a band that incorporates classical music, the most likely place to hear a harpsichord is in a concert hall, where classical music concerts are typically held. The options \"make noise\" and \"rubber band\" are not likely places to hear a harpsichord, and do not make sense in the context of the question."}

The other options (employment, working hard, love) do not accurately reflect the emotional state that the woman is likely feeling. Stress could be a possible answer, but it is not as strongly implied as frustration."}

Among the options provided, airports are often subject to extensive security measures, including controversial procedures such as body scanners and pat-downs. The other options (university, concert, home, terminal) may have security systems in place, but they are typically not subject to the same level of criticism as airports."}

Therefore, the question is likely asking about how often non-religious parties or events are held. The word \"frequent\" makes the most sense in this context, as it suggests that secular parties are held often. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to a different aspect of parties (such as their length or size) or are irrelevant (such as \"eternal\")."}

Exercise helps burn calories, which can lead to weight loss when paired with a healthy diet. The other options, such as fatigue and relaxation, do not necessarily encourage exercise or provide a clear reason why exercise would be beneficial."}

The options \"headaches\" and \"bigger brain\" are unlikely outcomes of learning, while \"education\" is too broad and general. \"Knowing more\" is too similar to the question itself and does not provide new information, leaving \"growth\" as the best option. Growth suggests that learning will lead to an expansion, improvement, or development of knowledge."}

The other options do not imply the same level of force and destruction that would be necessary to tear off shingles from a roof. \"Dry hair\" and \"spreading\" are too vague and do not give a clear indication of the wind's strength, while \"change direction\" and \"wave wheat\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

What is the oldest heat source on Earth?"}}, "k": "fire\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan has outfitted his house to run on the oldest heat source on Earth. Fire is the oldest form of heat used by humans and has been used for cooking, warmth, and light since prehistoric times. Solar energy and the sun are not heat sources that have been consistently used throughout human history. House is not a heat source at all, but rather a place where heat is contained. Coal or wood may be used as fuel for fire, but fire itself is the oldest heat source."}

They are typically housed in stables or farm yards where they have access to food, water, and shelter from the elements. While some horses may live at a race track during training and racing seasons, it is not a typical living arrangement for them. Michigan and Arizona are states and therefore not suitable living environments for horses."}

The option \"insane\" is a derogatory and incorrect assumption about her mental state. \"Annoy people around\" implies that she sings to irritate others, which is unlikely to be the reason behind her behavior. \"Inhale\" is not related to the context of the sentence. The option \"had good voice\" could be a possibility, but the sentence does not provide evidence to support it. The most likely answer is that she sings because she enjoys it, which is a common motive for performing music."}

Only Lake Superior fits this description, as it is the largest of the Great Lakes and is known for having a harsh winter climate. The other options do not match the context provided in the sentence."}

The options \"garage,\" \"horseradish,\" and \"basement\" are unlikely places for someone to sleep. \"Guest room\" is also unlikely, as it implies that the person is a guest in their own parents' house. Therefore, the most likely answer is \"living room,\" as this is a common room in a house and may be a place where a sofa bed is located."}

Where might he keep it?"}}, "k": "desk\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James keeps his clipboard close at hand for easy access. Typically, people keep items they use frequently on their desk, making it the most likely option among the choices. The other options are either nonsensical or do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "4ef33f70cca1726fe7b9b31904d9694b", "question": {"question_concept": "rug", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "persia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "table"}, {"label": "C", "text": "living room"}, {"label": "D", "text": "house"}, {"label": "E", "text": "desk"}], "stem": "The mother was worried about all the spills, so she bought a rug for under the what?"}}, "k": "table\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother was concerned about spills, and she specifically bought a rug to go under something. Since spills often occur during mealtime, it is reasonable to assume that the rug was purchased for a table. The other options do not relate to spills or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Cupboards can sometimes contain food items that have gone bad and can produce stale smells if not properly disposed of. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This could refer to issues with fertility, genetic disorders, or other medical conditions that make it difficult or impossible to conceive and carry a child to term. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

To find the total or combined value of these differences, you would need to add them together, which is represented by the word \"sum.\" The other answer choices imply a sense of similarity or likeness, which does not accurately reflect the concept of differences being added together."}

In the context of this question, the term \"success\" is being used to describe a positive outcome when attempting to reproduce. The other options such as celebrating or having a party are not related to the process of procreation and do not make sense in the given context. Hearing a crowd go mad or creating success are also not relevant options in this context."}

The options \"kitchen,\" \"hardware store,\" and \"garage\" are unlikely places for a janitor to keep their cleaning supplies. A \"wishing well\" is a decorative feature and not a practical location for a cleaning tool. A \"utility room\" is a room in a building dedicated to storing cleaning supplies, tools, and other necessary facilities maintenance equipment. Therefore, it is the most logical answer."}

Washing hands can help prevent the spread of illnesses and germs, which is why it is often recommended by doctors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The correct answer is likely a place where household linens are usually kept, such as a linen closet. The other options, such as the kitchen or a fabric store, do not make as much sense and are unlikely locations for household linens. Putting the cloth on a space heater is potentially dangerous, and the bedroom may or may not be the right location depending on the context of the situation."}

Record stores are where people usually buy vinyl records, as they specialize in selling music in physical formats. Safeway is a grocery store chain, and it is unlikely that they sell vinyl records. \"Record albums\" is a vague option that could refer to any place that sells music in physical and digital formats. \"Car\" and \"wallpaper\" have no connection to the context of buying vinyl records."}

What did doctors say about the side effects?"}}, "k": "peculiar\nKnowledge: The word \"peculiar\" is often used to describe unusual or unexpected behavior, so in this case, it suggests that the side effects Sally experienced were not typical or expected. The other choices all have positive connotations and do not fit with the context of the sentence, which suggests that the side effects were not desirable."}

Playing the piano involves choosing and striking keys on the instrument, which corresponds to the action of sitting in front of black and white keys. The other options, such as talking or reading a book, do not relate to the context of the sentence."}

The most likely location for purchasing a pen is an office supply store, which is specifically designed to sell office-related items, including pens. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The options 'house', 'den', and 'family room' all refer to indoor spaces where the chair might be located, but they do not answer the question about what the chair should sit on. 'Wood' is a material that might be used in furniture construction, but it does not indicate where the chair should be placed. 'Floor' is the most logical answer, as it is a flat and stable surface for furniture."}

First, the city is located in Northern Norway and is known for its activities during the Polar Nights half marathon. Second, the city is situated in the middle of the Northern lights oval, which suggests that it is a popular destination for viewing the Northern Lights. The only city that meets these criteria is Tromsø. The other options may be cities in Norway, but they do not match the specific details provided in the sentence."}

Where might his connection be?"}}, "k": "airport\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James had a connection, which is commonly used to refer to a secondary flight that a passenger must catch in order to reach their final destination. Airports often have connecting flights, making it the most likely option among the choices given. The other options (company, wall, computer network, love) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Safety glasses are also required in chemistry labs for eye protection during experiments. The other choices, such as a pub or restaurant, would not typically have isopropyl alcohol or safety glasses readily available. They are also not essential items for use in a park or supermarket setting."}

He could that he could only move by doing what?"}}, "k": "walking\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was not able to run, which implies that he could still move using another method. It can be inferred that the only way the man could move was by walking, as it is the only option in the choices that involves movement other than standing still. The other options either do not involve movement or do not reflect the context of the sentence."}

Among the given choices, \"thoughtful\" and \"discreet\" could be related to being cautious, but they do not quite capture the sense of deliberate risk aversion that is implied. \"Calculative\" may suggest a certain level of rationality, but still lacks the connotation of prudence. \"Careful\" is the most fitting antonym of \"foolhardy,\" as it denotes a state of being attentive and cautious in avoiding danger or mistakes."}

Playing and being kept in stables may be part of a horse's routine, but they do not directly contribute to their energy intake. \"Dominated\" is not a behavior that horses exhibit to get energy. Horses cannot drink coffee as it contains caffeine, which is harmful to them."}

Pandas are known to live in bamboo forests, so it makes sense that the koala would be displayed in a bamboo grove. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Exercising is commonly known to boost energy levels and create a feeling of alertness and vigor, which fits the option \"energetic\". \"Relaxation\" is not typically an immediate effect of exercising, and \"exhaustion\" may occur after exercising for a prolonged period of time. \"Becoming stronger\" is a long-term goal of exercising rather than an immediate effect. \"Using energy\" is a vague option and does not necessarily relate to the immediate effect of exercising."}

Among the given choices, only \"read book\" fits this description. Reading a book involves opening it up and immersing oneself in the story, which can be a form of escape and relaxation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Feeling sorry is a common response to causing harm, as it indicates remorse and a desire to make amends. Trusting God, crossing the street, riding a bike, and lending money do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The remaining options are candy bar and soda pop. While soda pop does have a lot of sugar, it is not necessarily a food that fits in your hand, especially since it usually comes in a can or bottle. Candy bars, on the other hand, are a common snack food that are often small enough to fit in your hand and are known for containing high amounts of sugar. Therefore, the correct answer is candy bar."}

The other options, such as hotels, motels, or law firms, may also have reception areas, but they are not as commonly associated with this term. A hall could refer to any type of hallway, so it doesn't specifically indicate a reception area."}

Rhythmic movement is a basic dance skill that involves moving the body in time with the beat of the music. The other options are not related to basic dance skills and would not be helpful in improving someone's ability to dance."}

She yelled at him not to leave his things where?"}}, "k": "hall\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's mother tripped over one of his things in a specific location. The most logical location for this to happen in a house would be a hall, which is a commonly used passage between rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The best way to achieve this goal is by actively listening to the professor. Taking notes can also help in retaining information, but it is not the primary action that would help the student to hear what the professor is saying. Completing a test or gaining experience are not relevant to the situation, and focus alone may not be sufficient for effective listening."}

While it is possible to feel sore and tired after a run, the question is asking about how someone would feel after completing the activity. Feeling a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment is a common response to completing a workout or physical activity such as running. Falling down is not a likely outcome of going for a run and is therefore an incorrect answer."}

Junk yards are locations where people can take their unwanted items, including appliances such as iceboxes, to be disposed of or salvaged. The other options are not relevant or appropriate places to dispose of a broken icebox - an antique store would likely not want a broken appliance, the graveyard is not a place for garbage, the kitchen is not a disposal site, and ice is not a disposal method."}

People liked her because she was what?"}}, "k": "honest\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary was known for being upfront and honest about her behavior, despite being described as \"bad.\" This implies that honesty is a positive trait in Mary and may be the reason why people liked her. The other options, such as \"excellent\" or \"worthy,\" do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information given. \"Fun\" and \"choice\" may be positive traits, but they do not have any clear connection to Mary's behavior or why people liked her."}

One of the attractions at Sea World is the shark tunnel, which allows visitors to view sharks swimming above them in an enclosed, clear tunnel. While sharks can be found in various locations such as the South Pacific, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico, the question specifically mentions a clear tunnel, which suggests that the answer is Sea World, as it is the only option that directly relates to this feature."}

When people form orderly lines, it becomes easier to manage and control a crowd. This reduces confusion and helps everyone move through the line in an efficient manner. The other options are unlikely as they do not fit the context of the sentence or do not make sense in the given situation."}

The other options do not adequately address the action of maintaining a straight arm while sustaining the weight of an object. \"Lift up\" and \"pick up\" both involve the initial action of raising an object, while \"lifting\" does not specify that the arm must be extended straight out. \"Hold onto\" implies a tight grip rather than an extended arm."}

A guilty conscience may drive someone to confess if they are struggling with the weight of their actions. Fear of being caught, punishment, or other consequences may also lead someone to confess. In some cases, confessing and cooperating with authorities could lead to a reduced sentence or the possibility of parole, allowing them to \"go free\" sooner rather than later. Personal problems or mental health issues could also play a role in someone confessing to a crime. Additionally, religious or spiritual beliefs could motivate someone to confess as a way of finding redemption or seeking forgiveness from a higher power."}

Among the choices given, only \"television\" is a medium for broadcasting programs. Concert, opera, and theater, while often televised, are not specific enough or appropriate given the context of the sentence. \"Take class\" is also not relevant to the question."}

This is because it makes it convenient for passengers to access the station from different parts of the city, as well as to transfer between different bus routes. Schools, streets, and catching a bus may not necessarily be convenient locations for a bus station, and maps are simply tools used to locate or navigate to a bus station."}

It can better be described as what?"}}, "k": "small group\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the crowd was not large, and the term \"small group\" best fits that description. The other options do not accurately reflect the size of the crowd mentioned in the sentence. Field and solitude refer to locations or feelings rather than group size, while alone and solitary imply an absence of other people altogether."}

The other options, such as a chicken coop or henhouse, are places where eggs are laid and collected, but not packaged for sale in stores. A supermarket is also unlikely to be the answer, as they typically sell pre-packaged eggs in egg cartons. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely egg carton."}

Since the account book contains important financial information, it should be kept in a safe and secure location. Of the choices given, keeping it in a desk drawer would be the most suitable option, as a desk is a common place to keep important documents in an office setting. The other options, such as keeping it with an accountant or in a bank, may not be feasible if you are leaving for an extended period of time. The option of keeping it in a purse would not be a secure option for important financial information."}

This involves hanging them outside or in a well-ventilated area to allow fresh air to circulate through the fabric and neutralize any odors. The other options (hanging in the closet, sniffing, getting dirty, becoming soiled) are not effective solutions for dealing with smelly clothes."}

However, the word \"feel\" in the question suggests that it is asking about emotional or psychological sensations rather than physical ones. Exhilaration is a common feeling associated with sports in general and football in particular, as the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of victory can create a sense of excitement and joy in players. The options \"pain,\" \"death,\" \"getting hurt,\" and \"get hurt\" are all negative and do not fit the context of the question."}

Fossilization occurs when organic materials are replaced by minerals over time, resulting in a hard, rock-like substance. The other options do not accurately describe the process of fossilization or the resulting substance."}

A thrift store typically sells used items, so it is unlikely that they would have a large selection of new teddy bears. A bed, shelf, or home are not options for purchasing a teddy bear. A toy store, on the other hand, specializes in selling toys and would likely have a variety of teddy bears to choose from."}

It is also possible that the inability to learn could impact effectiveness and educational achievements, but these options are not as directly related to the negative emotional experience suggested by the question. \"Intelligence\" and \"a stupid\" are not appropriate choices as they are not consequences, but rather intrinsic qualities that cannot be changed by one's ability to learn."}

The correct answer would be school children because the government's primary responsibility is to provide education to its citizens, which includes school children. The other options, such as parents or those who require to pay taxes, would not be the primary beneficiaries of government help in this context."}

New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the United States, so it would be the most likely choice for where the small dog would be found. The other options do not have any clear connection to New England or dogs being lost."}

Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question of how to hold loose papers together. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question. \"Tighten\" implies that the papers were loose because they were not secure enough, \"packaged\" implies that the papers are being prepared for transport, \"faithful\" is not related to the question at all, and \"compact\" does not relate to holding papers together."}

The phrase \"hear the crowd go mad\" specifically suggests that the band enjoyed the exhilaration of the audience's response at the beginning of each concert. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide any clear connection to the band's enjoyment of their success and fans."}

The options \"obtaining information\" and \"gathering of information\" suggest a more passive role, whereas \"sharing information\" and \"conversation\" do not necessarily imply the collaborative and dynamic nature of a brainstorming session. Therefore, \"exchange of ideas\" is the best fit for the context given."}

The most logical option would be a retail store that specializes in selling food products, as they are likely to have a variety of different barbecue sauces to choose from. The other options (detroit, australia, michigan park, cafe) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to offer a wide selection of barbecue sauces."}

The mention of NYC narrows down the options further, and the most likely place to find a mammoth exhibit in NYC is the American Museum of Natural History."}

The option \"refrigerator\" also indicates this. However, the clue \"to prevent them from getting nearby food wet\" suggests that the olives need to be contained separately. The option \"jar\" fits this description best as it is a container that can be sealed to keep the olives isolated from other foods. The other options do not offer a clear solution to the problem of keeping the olives dry."}

One of these is to sit properly at the table. Being sociable, talking, and drinking may also be part of the experience, but they are not the main action being asked here. \"Medium\" does not make sense in the given context."}

They are too small to be considered lakes, which are typically deeper and larger bodies of water. Swimming pools and children's pools are man-made and usually have a specific depth, while aquariums contain water specifically designed to support aquatic life and may have a variety of depths."}

It involves moving your head up and down, often in a subtle manner, to communicate agreement with or understanding of what someone else is saying. The other options don't make sense in the context of the question. \"Like more\" doesn't have any clear connection to indicating agreement, wearing rings is unrelated, and shaking hands can indicate agreement but it is more commonly used to greet someone or signify a deal has been reached. \"Concordance\" is a less common word that means agreement or harmony, but it is not a physical action that you would use to indicate agreement with someone."}

What might he have been feeling?"}}, "k": "quitting\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James no longer wants to compete, indicating that he may be feeling a desire to quit or give up. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Pressure and trying harder suggest that James wants to continue competing but is experiencing difficulty, while death and winning or losing are unlikely to be the reasons why James wants to stop competing."}

It explains that you do not want to get germs onto your food or inside your body. The logical part of the body where germs could enter is the mouth, which makes it the correct answer. The other choices are not directly related to the context of the sentence."}

The most likely option among the choices is a tomb, since tombs are often located underground or within central structures, and are associated with the burial of important people or treasures. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence."}

The other options may also have rose bushes, but they are not as specific, and there is no direct evidence or association between them and the presence of a rose bush."}

The trunk of a car is a common place to store luggage while driving, making it the most likely answer choice. The other options, such as a closet or sidewalk, do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while leaving the luggage at a hotel or bus stop would not be practical if the man was driving himself to the airport."}

The United States is well-known for its strong tradition of banjo music, particularly in genres like bluegrass and folk. The other options, such as music shops, jug bands, or nice people, are not relevant to the history or popularity of the banjo."}

Forgiveness is seen as a positive action that can lead to positive outcomes, thus activating good karma. The other options, while potentially positive outcomes of forgiveness, do not have a clear association with the idea of a hidden force being activated."}

The answer \"perfection\" does not fit this context as it implies the absence of mistakes, whereas the question is specifically asking about tracking mistakes. \"Happiness\" and \"sore muscles\" are unrelated to the context and \"injury\" is related to a negative aspect of the game, but not specifically related to tracking mistakes."}

The options that fit this requirement are large room, country club and grand casino. However, country clubs and grand casinos are known to be more expensive compared to large rooms, and restaurants and lobbies usually have smaller spaces. Therefore, the best choice would be a large room."}

The option \"ink cartridges\" is the most likely correct answer because it is a common cause of pens not working. Ink cartridges can become clogged or run out of ink, which can prevent the pen from writing properly. The other options, such as \"take notes\" or \"scribble,\" do not address the problem of the pens not working, while the option \"caps\" may help prevent the pens from drying out but does not solve the current problem."}

The most common place where this arrangement can be found is in a large shopping mall, which typically contains numerous stores and entertainment options like movie theaters, restaurants, and arcades. The other options are not as likely to offer this combination of amenities, making shopping mall the correct answer."}

The other options (jewelry store, case, watch store) do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not places where someone would sell an item quickly for cash, especially for drug money."}

The other options, such as \"get arrested\" and \"problems,\" suggest negative consequences associated with drinking alcohol, while the option \"sober\" suggests the opposite of why someone might want to buy beer. \"Intoxication\" is a possible reason, but the word carries a negative connotation, while \"pleasure\" is a more neutral term that better fits the context."}

The options vessel and submarine suggest they might be on a boat or a submarine, but those options do not fit the context of reaching a base. The option lamp has no apparent connection to the sentence. Box could potentially refer to a portable radio, but the most likely option in this context is transistor as it is a common type of radio used for communication in remote locations."}

The option \"smell smoke\" could be a possible outcome if the pizza was left in the oven for too long and began to burn, but it does not directly answer the question based on the context of the sentence. \"Catch cold,\" \"look angry,\" and \"bank savings\" do not have any clear connection to the sentence."}

Wild animals are not accustomed to being touched by humans and may perceive it as a threat, leading them to defend themselves by biting. The other options do not make sense or are unlikely in the context of the sentence."}

It always brought what?"}}, "k": "complications\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that Danny does not enjoy helping people, which suggests that it brings negative consequences. The word \"complications\" indicates that helping others causes difficulties or problems for Danny. The other options all suggest positive outcomes, which do not fit with the negative tone of the sentence."}

Owning a house, winning the lottery, saving money, and feeling safe may all be desirable goals, but they are not directly related to finding a way to make more money at work."}

The zoo is a common place to see a variety of animals in captivity, making it the most relevant choice. The workplace, sky, and New York City do not have any clear connection to seeing animals, while \"many places\" is too vague to be a specific answer."}

Therefore, \"make payments\" is the most appropriate answer, as it is a common activity that one would do in a bank, such as paying bills, depositing or withdrawing money, or transferring funds."}

Milk is a common ingredient in cheese production, and if the cheese is left to age or become old, it is possible for fungus to grow on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

New Mexico is a southwestern state in the United States that is known for its desert climate and warm temperatures, so it is likely that this would be a suitable habitat for a snake. The other options are not likely to have the same climate features that a snake would prefer, so they can be eliminated."}

John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be?"}}, "k": "anywhere else\nKnowledge: The sentence states that John preferred glass, suggesting that he does not like plastic. He also wishes he was somewhere else, which implies that he is unhappy in his current environment. The option \"anywhere else\" best fits this context, as it implies a desire to be in a different, unspecified location. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence."}

Airplanes commonly have metal rods as part of their structure, such as the wings and the fuselage. Construction sites may also have metal rods, but they are not typically associated with transportation. Shops and broken bones are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.

It didn't matter.   He didn't heave anything to put it on, and he lacked the what to balance it?"}}, "k": "coaster\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the man did not have anything to put the cup on, thus indicating the need for a coaster. A coaster is an object that is often used to place a cup or glass on to protect the table or surface it is resting on.

While some people may enjoy socializing at work or in the office, these locations are not typically associated with leisure time or relaxation. \"Deep thought\" is not a location at all, but rather a state of mind or activity. \"Friend's house\" is the only option that makes sense in the context of leisurely socializing."}

How would you describe him?"}}, "k": "known person\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the person referred to as Billy is not a stranger, but they haven't talked to him frequently. The phrase \"known person\" can encompass anyone who is not a stranger but may not necessarily be a family member or friend. The other options either do not fit or overlap with the concept of a known person."}

Dancing, talking, playing the piano, and answering a question do not have any connection to bridge building."}

The subway is a common form of public transportation in many cities, and people often read newspapers or other materials while riding it. In contrast, reading newspapers on the front lawn or at a bookstore or library does not fit the context of the question."}

A utility closet is a common location for janitorial supplies within a building such as a school cafeteria. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While stress, backache, and low pay are all negative outcomes that can result from doing housework, becoming tired is a common and expected outcome. Housework can involve physical exertion and repetitive tasks, which can lead to fatigue and exhaustion. Putting on shoes is not necessarily related to housework and does not fit the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, we can assume that the answer must be something that will counteract the wetness and make the marmoset comfortable. Of the choices given, only a warm climate could achieve this, as it would help the marmoset dry off and regulate its body temperature. The other options (rain, France, shopping mall, great outdoors) do not address the issue of the marmoset being wet and would not necessarily make it happy."}

This implies that math competitions are a way for students to further engage with and challenge themselves in a subject they already enjoy, rather than a way for struggling students to improve their skills. The other options are not consistent with the idea that math competitions are primarily enjoyable or engaging for participants."}

Drinking alcohol is a common activity in bars, especially during celebrations, and it is not uncommon for people to drink too much and become intoxicated. Eating cake and having sex are not necessarily related to celebrating in a bar and may be uncommon activities in such a setting."}

He used his hand to shade his eyes from what?"}}, "k": "moon\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam is underground where there is likely no direct or full sunlight, and brightness or bright light may not be expected either. Since he is shading his eyes, it implies that he needs to adjust to a sudden change in lighting. The use of the word \"unexpected\" also indicates that the lighting source is not typical or commonplace, which rules out direct or full sunlight. The only option that fits this scenario is the moon, which can provide a natural but unexpected source of light in underground areas."}

Orgasm, pregnancy, and herpes do not determine who is likely or unlikely to have sex as they are related to aspects of sexual activity such as pleasure, reproduction and sexually transmitted infections. Human is not a relevant option as all humans are capable of having sex."}

Fear is a common emotion associated with committing murder, as the person may be afraid of getting caught or facing consequences such as going to jail. The other options do not accurately describe the emotions associated with committing murder."}

Watching television and smelling smoke are not relevant options for getting somewhere. Walking is a logical choice when tired from running as it is a slower and less strenuous form of transportation."}

Therefore, it is likely to be on a page when a sentence is written. The other options are not related to the context of the question or the function of a period in writing."}

The other options do not accurately describe the sensation of breathing fresh air in the countryside."}

The most likely place for a student to leave their writing instrument would be the classroom, where they were taking their classes. The other options are not likely places for a student to leave their writing instrument, as a desk drawer or pocket would require the student to remove it from their possession and a bathroom or stationery store would mean the student left the classroom entirely."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "5eb81520707291e95a165ac7b6a3d698", "question": {"question_concept": "employees", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "talk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "company"}, {"label": "C", "text": "corporation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "meeting"}, {"label": "E", "text": "office"}], "stem": "What do employees have when they want to have a group discussion?"}}, "k": "meeting\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that employees want to discuss something as a group, which is commonly done through a meeting. A meeting is a formal gathering where people can discuss and exchange ideas, which makes it the most appropriate option among the choices given. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as 'talk' is too vague and can suggest informal discussion, 'company' and 'corporation' refer to a business entity rather than an action or situation, and 'office' is too general and could refer to the physical space rather than a specific activity."}

The option \"work\" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to the context of the sentence. The other options (asthma, headache, arguments, boredom) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The bathroom is the most common location for a scale as it is a private area within the home, and it is convenient for most people to use the scale after their morning routine. The other options, such as doctor's office, assay office, post office, or study, are not commonly associated with personal weighing scales."}

The most common place to put mail that has just been brought in from outside is on a table or countertop. Placing it in the neighbor's house or post office doesn't make sense, and the fridge and bathroom are not usual places to store mail."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While tomato sauce may be sold in markets and stored in refrigerators, those options don't necessarily connect to the context of the question, nor do growing tomatoes in a vegetable garden or using it in a cake."}

One common way that people express joy and happiness is through smiling, which involves the contraction of facial muscles to pull the corners of the mouth upward. The other options are not related to the physical expression of happiness or fun on someone's face."}

Brunch is typically served in the late morning or early afternoon, so it is not a correct answer. Fast food restaurant is also not a meal but rather a type of establishment. \"Appear appetizing\" is not a meal at all. Plate is not a meal, but rather a piece of serving ware. Therefore, the correct answer is likely dinner, which is a commonly served meal in the evening."}

The phrase \"well fed\" means that someone has had plenty to eat and is therefore satisfied. The other options do not provide any clear explanation for why the person would burp with satisfaction."}

Empowering and luck are unlikely as these are positive emotions and hurting someone else is generally considered a negative action. Punishment may be an outcome, but it is not an emotion. Despair is also possible, but regret is a more accurate answer as it is commonly understood that hurting someone else can lead to feelings of remorse and regret."}

Out of the given options, \"work in school\" is the most general and broad answer that would encompass a wide range of tasks a teacher may perform during a typical week, such as planning lessons, grading papers, communicating with parents or colleagues, attending meetings, etc. The other options are either too specific (demonstrate, time test, eat lunch) or too vague (school children) to accurately capture the main activities of a teacher during a week."}

The most likely place to find such pens would be in an office, where they might be given as gifts to clients or employees or used for marketing purposes. The other options such as \"on a pencil\" and \"backpack\" are unlikely to have pens with a company logo, and the options \"write sentences on paper\" and \"school\" don't provide any context for the specific type of pen being asked about."}

To find information in an old library, one would need to search for it in the card catalog using the author, title, or subject. Chewing, ask questions, and logic are not relevant to the process of using a card catalog to find information in a library. Time may be required, but the question specifically asks about the process of finding information in a card catalog."}

He also bought a new what?"}}, "k": "fishing rod\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Gary made a practical investment before going off to the tournament. The fact that the company is a fortune 500 company suggests that it is a well-established and profitable business. The fact that he bought a new item in addition to the stock suggests that he had some spare cash to invest in something more immediate or enjoyable. A fishing rod is a common item for someone to buy before going off on a trip, and it also fits with the idea of making a practical investment in a potentially profitable stock. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The word \"sword\" is typically associated with fencing as it refers to the weapon used in the sport. A sword is a long, thin, pointed metal weapon that is used for thrusting or slashing in historical combat or modern sports like fencing."}

Based on this, the most logical answer would be an internet cafe, as this is a common place where people can access computers when they don't have their own. The other options, such as school, office building, and hell, do not make sense in this context. Despair is an emotional state and not a physical location."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "e9b2e87700d943c8de5cb6e6c905e723", "question": {"question_concept": "fire extinguisher", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "school bus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "car"}, {"label": "C", "text": "garage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stairwell"}, {"label": "E", "text": "hospital"}], "stem": "Where can you keep a fire extinguisher in the house if it's really big?"}}, "k": "garage\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the fire extinguisher is really big, which means it will need to be stored in a location with enough space to accommodate it. The options of school bus, car, and hospital are unlikely, as these are not typical locations for storing fire extinguishers. The stairwell may be too narrow to store a large fire extinguisher, making the garage the best option as it provides ample space and is commonly used for storage."}

Therefore, the options \"full of air\" and \"round\" are not correct. \"Popular in America\" and \"not tall\" do not provide any relevant information to why a basketball could not be used. The option \"punctured\" is the correct answer as a punctured basketball would not hold air and would be unable to bounce or be used effectively."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "3746f0db999d2789f242b9c0c1f64f4b", "question": {"question_concept": "automobile", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "side of road"}, {"label": "B", "text": "parking garage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "street"}, {"label": "D", "text": "garage"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fast lane"}], "stem": "Where would an automobile drive in order to get somewhere quicker?"}}, "k": "fast lane\nKnowledge: The question is asking for a location where an automobile can get somewhere faster than usual. The fast lane is a lane on a highway that is designated for faster-moving traffic, making it the logical choice for this question. The other options do not involve driving quickly or efficiently, such as driving on the side of the road, in a parking garage, or in a garage. Street is a possibility, but it is a broad term and does not necessarily imply speed or efficiency."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "fda68c1d0b4d803104723e1ae9b47338", "question": {"question_concept": "reading", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "watching tv"}, {"label": "B", "text": "listening"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sleeping"}, {"label": "D", "text": "illiterate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "illiteracy"}], "stem": "The college student much preferred reading during her free time, her roommates on the other hand preferred what?"}}, "k": "watching tv\nKnowledge: The sentence compares the college student's preference for reading during her free time with her roommates' preference for something else. The phrase \"on the other hand\" indicates a contrast, which suggests that the roommates' preference is different from the college student's. The most logical option based on this information is \"watching tv\" since it is a common leisure activity that is often done in a shared space, like a college dorm room. The options \"listening\" and \"sleeping\" do not provide enough information to infer a contrast with reading, while \"illiterate\" and \"illiteracy\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

They are not commonly found in domestic settings like on the floor or in warm places like indoors. They may be in trouble if their habitat is threatened or if they are hunted, but this is not a general characteristic of their presence. A dog's mouth is not a suitable place for wild cats as dogs are predators and may harm the cats."}

The other options do not make sense in this context - dropping out of school would mean the child is not a student, washing dishes and reading a book are not typically requirements for becoming a student, and \"study book\" is not a grammatically correct phrase."}

A relative's home may also give you items to take home, but it's not a public place. However, you wouldn't need a shopping bag at a restaurant unless you had leftover food that you didn't finish and wanted to take home with you. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant."}

The other options do not fit as well with the question, as \"funeral\" and \"remorse\" are consequences of killing rather than how it is thought of, and \"horrible\" and \"going to jail\" are more general descriptors that could apply to many things."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "de591f5d67a7cefe8aaa7fa6aa781389", "question": {"question_concept": "learning about science", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "headache"}, {"label": "B", "text": "see things differently"}, {"label": "C", "text": "increased knowledge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "accidents"}, {"label": "E", "text": "appreciation of nature"}], "stem": "What might someone get from learning about science?"}}, "k": "increased knowledge\nKnowledge: Learning about science is often associated with gaining knowledge and understanding of natural phenomena, laws of the universe, and technological advancements. The other options, such as headache or accidents, are not typically associated with learning science. Appreciation of nature could be a potential benefit of learning science, but it is not as direct as gaining increased knowledge. Seeing things differently may also occur, but this is not exclusive to learning science and it is not a guaranteed outcome."}

The option describing poverty is unlikely to be correct, as industrialization often leads to greater economic growth and a decline in poverty rates. The other options may be related to industry but do not fully capture the overall impact on human life and society. \"Civilization\" is the best answer as it suggests that the introduction of industry led to a transformation in the way humans organized themselves and created a more complex social structure."}

Running away is a common response for animals when they feel threatened, and the fact that the cat sees animal control approaching implies that there may be a reason for her to feel threatened. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "b3a6431c586083b319f704f78060e2c4", "question": {"question_concept": "indulgent", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "severe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "harsh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hard"}, {"label": "D", "text": "strict"}, {"label": "E", "text": "self denying"}], "stem": "How bad is the punishment for someone who is over indulgent?"}}, "k": "self denying\nKnowledge: The use of the phrase \"over indulgent\" suggests that the punishment for this behavior would be one of self-denial, such as practicing restraint or limiting oneself in some way. The other options all suggest external punishments imposed by others, which do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "cd1c421ca653909ebe71375758f8b293", "question": {"question_concept": "towels", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "swimming pool"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hotel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "motel"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stored on towel rack"}], "stem": "Where would you bring some towels other than to a shower?"}}, "k": "swimming pool\nKnowledge: Towels are commonly used at swimming pools to dry off after swimming or lounging on a poolside chair. While they could be brought to a hotel or motel, the question specifically asks for a location where the towels would be used, not just stored or brought to. The beach is another possibility, but the question implies that the towels would be brought somewhere specific, not just for general use at any beach. Stored on a towel rack is not a location where the towels would be brought, but rather where they would be stored."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "cc1aef2c2845c8d34e154acff5f0aed4", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "write stories"}, {"label": "B", "text": "talk to each other"}, {"label": "C", "text": "go fishing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "die of starvation"}, {"label": "E", "text": "eat fish"}], "stem": "What do people do if they are near the sea?"}}, "k": "go fishing\nKnowledge: The question asks what people typically do if they are near the sea, and one common activity associated with the sea is fishing. Fishing is a popular pastime for many people who live near the coast or visit the beach, and it provides a source of food and enjoyment. While some people may write stories or talk to each other near the sea, these activities are not as closely associated with the context of the question as fishing is. Additionally, the options of dying of starvation or eating fish are not valid choices, as they are not activities that people choose to do near the sea."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. An airplane cabin may be used by many professions, but an army captain would not typically be found there. Similarly, a basketball team may have a captain, but they would not be referred to as an army captain, nor would they typically be found on a basketball team. A battleship or fleet may be associated with the military, but it is not clear that an army captain would specifically be found on a battleship or among a fleet of ships."}

The term \"die\" suggests that the people in question are killed, and the context of horror movies supports the idea that they are likely murdered in a violent or gruesome manner. The other options do not fit with the context of the question, since they do not pertain to horror movies or deaths."}

Cheese is known to improve with age, as the bacteria naturally present in the cheese continue to break down the fats and proteins. Additionally, certain types of cheese are intentionally aged to enhance their flavor, such as cheddar or gouda. The other options, such as \"eat cake\" or \"salad dressing,\" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The most common dish used as an alternative to a plate would be a bowl. Saucers are typically used as a side dish for tea or coffee, forks are an eating utensil, cups are used for drinking, and food is not a dish, but rather what is being eaten."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "a460e2be1be55d0f29b6f5f640e01b32", "question": {"question_concept": "eating breakfast", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "tasty"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bad breath"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dirty dishes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "better day"}, {"label": "E", "text": "gain energy"}], "stem": "Eating breakfast of garlic might lead to some what?"}}, "k": "bad breath\nKnowledge: Garlic is well-known for causing a strong odor in the breath, especially when consumed raw or in high quantities. Therefore, the sentence suggests that eating garlic for breakfast could lead to bad breath. The other options are not relevant to the context and do not have any connection to the effects of garlic consumption."}

The only option that fits this description is \"plains\". The other options do not convey the idea of a surrounding geographical feature. A \"molehill\" is too small, a \"field\" is not high enough, a \"dale\" is a valley rather than a feature that surrounds something, and while mountains can create climbing challenges, this option does not fit with the surrounding context of the sentence."}

The instructor specifically asks everyone to close their eyes, which is a common practice during meditation. The other answer choices do not align with the sentence's context, as celebrating or plotting destruction would not typically be associated with self-improvement, and eating better and feeling better about oneself do not relate specifically to the action of closing one's eyes."}

The options \"jamb\" and \"own house\" do not refer to a specific room, while \"kitchen\" and \"building\" are common places where hinged doors are found. However, washing machines usually do not have hinged doors but rather a front-loading or top-loading configuration, making it the correct answer."}

Coral reefs provide blowfish with ample protection from predators while also offering a variety of food sources, making it an ideal habitat for them. The other choices do not offer the necessary environment for a blowfish to survive, as they are not found in palm trees, books, fish markets, or aquariums in the wild."}

The surface of the earth includes various environments where footprints could be left, such as in mud, sand, or snow. However, the question specifies \"man-made item,\" so this choice is less likely. The ground is a vague term and does not specifically refer to a man-made object. However, footprints could be left on a flat or sloped surface, such as a roof."}

Given the context of the phrase \"jealousy,\" it is reasonable to assume that the action is negative or aggressive in nature. Therefore, \"wage war\" is the most likely correct answer, as countries have historically gone to war based on feelings of jealousy towards other nations. The other options do not have a strong connection to jealousy or aggressive behavior."}

The other options, such as dropping out or catching a cold, do not have any clear correlation to the benefits of attending school.

Simply being able to hear someone's words is not enough to be considered listening. Being very quiet can be helpful in listening, but it is not the skill itself. \"Shut up\" is inappropriate and implies not allowing someone to speak, which is the opposite of listening. \"Hatred\" has no connection to the question at hand."}

A computer is capable of processing information and making decisions, so those options can be eliminated. Computers also cannot cast shadows, but this is not necessarily a defining characteristic of what a computer cannot do. However, becoming sensible is something that is exclusive to humans and cannot be replicated by computers or machines. Therefore, the correct answer is \"become sensible.\""}

While grapes are often used in cooking, they are not typically found in a kitchen on their own. Grapes come from fields or vineyards, and they are usually sold at fruit stands or used in wineries. They may also be served on a plate as a snack or part of a meal, but they would not be found in a kitchen unless someone had brought them in from another location."}

Fear and anger do not align with a positive experience, while curiosity and wonder may be neutral or positive, but excitement is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a high level of positive emotion and energy."}

Of the options given, \"conversation\" makes the most sense, as it is a common activity people engage in before going back to work. Anxiety, depression, and fighting are negative actions that people wouldn't want to be doing before going back to work, and earning money doesn't make sense in the context given."}

Where might he live?"}}, "k": "apartment\nKnowledge: The fact that James bought a hide bed sofa suggests that he is living in a space where efficiency is important, such as an apartment. Typically, people living in houses or villages have more space and do not have to prioritize space efficiency in their furniture choices. Similarly, someone living in a hotel would not have a need for a hide bed sofa, as their accommodations are usually temporary. While some beach condos also have limited space, the context of the sentence does not provide any indication that James is specifically living in a beach condo."}

As the clouds become heavier with moisture, they are more likely to release it in the form of rain. The other options, such as cloud vision or rain water, do not make as much sense in the context of the question.

The word \"shallow\" implies that the body of water is not very deep and may be small, which rules out options like lakes and ponds. \"Children's pools\" and \"swimming pools\" may be too large or too expensive for a typical backyard. Therefore, the best option is \"puddle,\" which is a small, shallow body of water that could occur naturally or from rainfall."}

Of the choices given, only \"marry\" is a privilege that is typically only available to adults. Dressing oneself, drinking beer, working, and driving a train are not inherently privileges reserved solely for adults. While certain jobs may require a minimum age for employment, they are not privileges in the same way that the legal ability to marry is."}

The most logical answer would be the neighbor's house, as it is a common place for a person to access furniture that is not in their own home. The other options are less likely because they are either too specific (person's living room, livingroom) or not related to the context of the question (White House, home)."}

The purpose of charging up the anger bar is likely to increase the player's ability to engage in combat and defeat the enemy. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence or the concept of an anger bar in video games."}

Diving and going down do not necessarily suggest a fall from a height, and injuries could refer to a wide range of potential outcomes without specifying the likelihood of pain and/or broken bones."}

There was a much smaller population where?"}}, "k": "wilderness\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the bright, populated city and a location with a smaller population. The options \"suburbs\", \"town\", and \"countryside\" are all areas that typically have a higher population density than the wilderness. \"Outside\" is too vague to be a clear answer. Therefore, the correct answer is \"wilderness,\" which is an area typically defined by its lack of human populations and bright city lights."}

While apples can be obtained from a variety of sources, the options \"table\" and \"fridge\" do not make sense in this context. \"Farmers market\" may be a valid option, but the use of the word \"typically\" suggests that it is not as common as the option \"grocery store\". Finally, \"apple tree\" is not a plausible answer as it is a source of apples rather than a place to purchase them."}

This method allows the buyer to find the best deal or price for the product they want. Bankruptcy and loss of money are not relevant to finding the best price, while overstocking and playing games do not describe a practical method for buying products."}

Therefore, it is likely that a knight would be depicted as a hero in literature or events related to this time period. Castle may also be a possible answer, as many knights lived in castles and defended them from invaders. Renaissance festival and chess set have no clear connection to knights or heroism in this context, while historical novel is too vague to determine a specific answer."}

It is also a common material for bridges due to its strength and durability. Therefore, all of the options listed could potentially be constructed using steel. However, it's worth noting that the size of the house may be too small to warrant the use of steel."}

Dawn is the time period before sunrise, early morning is the time period after sunrise but before midday, and night is the time period after evening and before sunrise. Sunset marks the end of the daytime, so evening cannot come before it."}

Stretching something typically results in it becoming larger or more spacious, so it is likely that the socks will have a looser fit after being stretched. The other options do not make sense in the context of sock stretching."}

The best option that fits this context is \"talk,\" as getting together with a friend over coffee is typically an opportunity to catch up and have a conversation. The other options, such as \"excitement,\" \"joy,\" \"abuse,\" and \"panic\" do not have any clear connection to the context of meeting a friend over coffee."}

By lying on a rock in the sun, they can absorb the warmth of the sun's rays and raise their body temperature to an optimal level. The other options may also be applicable to areas where lizards are commonly found, but they do not provide a direct explanation for why a lizard would lay on a rock in the sun."}

Bleeding is a common response to puncture wounds caused by sharp objects, such as needles. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The most logical place for Billy to find a stepladder would be in a store room where tools and equipment are kept. The other options, such as a tool shed, hardware store, construction worker's vehicle, or library, may also have stepladders, but they are not the most likely places for Billy to have found one in the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as colliding or bottoming out, do not make sense as benefits of ships. Carrying people and sailors may be related to ships, but those options do not directly answer the question."}

Out of the given options, a preschool would be the most appropriate place for this. Playgrounds, big houses, buildings, and grandma's house do not necessarily have the same educational focus as a preschool."}

The word \"dangerous\" would be a fitting description for rapids that are choppy, as choppy rapids can be more difficult to navigate and pose a greater risk to those who are trying to navigate them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Since the opposite of solidity is hollowness, this means that the building is empty or has a lack of material inside. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of a building lacking solidity, as instability and weakness are related to structural integrity and openness is related to space or lack thereof."}

The options \"recreational, good looking, fun, and violent\" do not seem to have any direct connection to this idea. However, the option \"competitive\" makes sense because sports are often organized around some form of competition or contest, whether it be between individuals or teams. Additionally, human beings are known to be competitive by nature, which may explain why sports have become such a prominent aspect of many cultures worldwide."}

It is commonly used to plan and navigate routes for travelling. An atlas is a collection of maps, and while it could be used for this purpose, it is not as practical for quick reference as a single map. The post office is not typically associated with travel planning or navigation. \"Get to a specific place\" and \"phone\" are not items that are used directly to figure out the best route for travelling."}

Arthritis is a possible side effect of playing guitar, but it is not a typical outcome of playing. Listening to music might be a general interest of someone who is inclined to play the guitar, but it is not specific to the activity of playing itself."}

The use of the word \"shoot\" suggests that the activity was related to filming. The option \"pornography\" fits this criteria, as it is a commonly filmed activity that could make potential buyers uncomfortable with the property. The other options do not relate to an activity that would make a house difficult to sell."}

This would be more likely to occur in a smaller town rather than a city, where there would be more lodging options available. Mexico and a holiday are not specific enough to provide a clear answer, while a phone book is irrelevant to the question."}

Therefore, the correct answer is likely \"tomb,\" as it is the only option that pertains to a burial site. The other options, such as \"museum\" or \"hospital,\" do not have any clear connection to the context of finding a bone wrapped in cloth."}

They are known for being habitats for small aquatic organisms, such as crabs, starfish, and anemones. This makes them a popular spot for beachcombing and exploring during low tide. The other options are less likely to have crabs, with the cooking pot being a tool for cooking them, beach sand being too exposed, the Chesapeake Bay being too large, and the fish market being a place to buy them rather than find them."}

In this context, a \"demonstration\" is the most likely activity a spectator would watch, as companies may showcase their products in action or explain their benefits through live presentations. The other options - sporting event, racing, show, and watch event - are not typically associated with trade shows."}

The only option that fits this time frame is \"night,\" as it occurs after dusk and before dawn. The other options all refer to earlier times in the day and do not fit the context of the sentence."}

Bloodshot eyes are a common symptom of sleep deprivation or tiredness, which may explain why the person needed drops to clear up their eyes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While \"store\" could be interpreted as a possible answer, it is too generic and could apply to any type of storage. The other options, such as \"everything\" or \"clothes closet,\" have no connection to the context of the question. \"Cupboard\" is the most likely answer as it is a common storage location for utensils and dishes in a kitchen setting."}

Art museums are commonly known to showcase a variety of different works of art, which could explain why many features are displayed there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

In this context, it is unlikely that the person's success is based on their culinary skills or ability to acquire wealth. Therefore, the most likely answer is that they are skilled at making people feel valued and appreciated, which is often done through the use of compliments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

A bowling alley is a common place where people play this game, and a lane is a specific section of the alley where you throw the ball towards the pins. The other options, such as city, basketball court, rural countryside, or highway, are not relevant to the context of the sentence and have no connection to playing bowling."}

Therefore, it is unlikely that excitement would be allowed in a library, as it could disturb other patrons. The other options are all associated with events or activities where excitement is expected or encouraged. For example, hockey games and boxing matches are known for their action and physicality, while car shows and dances provide opportunities for socializing and having fun."}

This suggests that they must rely on other methods of locomotion, such as crawling. The other choices don't necessarily have a direct connection to the fact that female ants don't have wings, and therefore do not make sense in this context."}

The other options such as classroom, book store, and synagogue do not have any relation to the context of taking a book on vacation, while the briefcase is more commonly associated with carrying work-related documents and items rather than personal leisure items like books."}

The phrase \"wild ride\" is commonly associated with rodeos, where cowboys attempt to stay on bucking bulls for as long as possible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"fun\" best fits this description, as it is often associated with activities intended to be entertaining or enjoyable. The other options may also be desirable outcomes, but they do not fit as well with the specific context of the sentence."}

The only option that is a body part is the arm, which is commonly shaved or waxed by both men and women. The other options, such as mammals, person's head, mammoth trunk, and sink, have no connection to the context of the question."}

Instead, passing water (urination) could be a biological process that naturally occurs when animals are near water sources. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - feeling pain, flying, dying of cancer, and feeling pleasure are not actions that can be attributed to animals in this particular scenario."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "ee9a374176ae07c14ab7c0b2adc02b7b", "question": {"question_concept": "going to play", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "being entertained"}, {"label": "B", "text": "spending money"}, {"label": "C", "text": "intermission"}, {"label": "D", "text": "weight loss"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sleepiness"}], "stem": "The children were going to play, the parents encouraged it hoping it resulted in what?"}}, "k": "being entertained\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the parents are encouraging the children to play for a specific outcome. Given the context, it's likely that the desired outcome is related to the parents' enjoyment or relaxation (since they are not specified). Being entertained fits this the best, as playing is a common way for children to engage in fun activities that can be enjoyable for adults to watch or participate in. The other options (spending money, intermission, weight loss, sleepiness) do not make sense in this context."}

Fear of losing the ability to work is a common theme in discussions about A.I., as it is expected to replace many jobs that are currently performed by humans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Bees are known to be attracted to the sweet scent of apple cider, so it would be wise to be careful of them in an orchard where there may be beehives. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

After all, it was what they were what?"}}, "k": "getting paid for\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally hired people for a specific purpose, and that purpose was related to entertainment. The phrase \"that was what she expected\" suggests that the people she hired were doing what they were supposed to do. The only choice that makes sense in this context is \"getting paid for,\" as it suggests that Sally expected the people she hired to provide entertainment as part of their job. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

What was he?"}}, "k": "servant\nKnowledge: The sentence explicitly states that John was a servant, meaning he likely did tasks or work for someone else. None of the other choices align with the description of a servant, as they imply a higher level of authority or freedom."}

The options \"skyscraper,\" \"tall building,\" and \"apartment building\" all fit this description, but \"skyscraper\" implies a more grandiose building than the others, and \"tall building\" is too generic. \"Book of stories\" and \"mall\" have nothing to do with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most likely answer is \"apartment building.\""}

What is even more common than kids?"}}, "k": "pregnancy\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there are other consequences of sex besides procreation. Since the question is asking for what is even more common than kids, we can eliminate twins and children born as options. The mention of venereal disease and used condoms suggest potential negative consequences of sex, but they are not necessarily more common than pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy is the most logical answer to the question."}

Bus stops are often used as a meeting point for people waiting to take public transportation, and they can be found in various locations such as urban areas or outside of city limits.

He just didn't want to be what?"}}, "k": "alone\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam did not care about the company he kept on Christmas, suggesting that being alone was the primary concern. The options solitude and loneliness also suggest being alone, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence. The option he wants to marry is not relevant to the sentence and appears to be a non-sequitur. The option you is not relevant as it is not clear who \"you\" refers to in the sentence."}

The other options may be related to the act of buying, but they do not represent the actual requirement for purchasing something. Going shopping may mean browsing or looking at items, but it does not necessarily imply buying. Paying may be part of the process of buying, but it does not encompass the entire action. Having something in mind is a personal preference, but it does not necessarily mean that one will buy it. A shop is simply a place where one can buy things, but it does not represent the action of buying itself."}

Asking questions is a common way for children to learn new things, as they are naturally curious and seek answers to their inquiries. The other options do not have a clear connection to the task of learning new things, such as driving, which is not typically a skill that children can develop at a young age."}

The options \"elevator,\" \"cassettes,\" and \"store\" are unlikely choices because they do not provide a public space for enjoying music. While music can be enjoyed at an opera, not all operas allow public access. A theatre, however, is a public venue where music performances are frequently held, making it the best choice for the answer."}

With that he'd be able to have two people stay over, one in the guest room, and one on the sofa.  Where might he have been?"}}, "k": "apartment \nKnowledge: The sentence mentions James wanting to add space for an extra guest, indicating that he already has a place to accommodate guests. The options hotel and guest room are already mentioned in the sentence are not relevant. The mention of buying a hide bed sofa suggests that James has limited space in his living quarters and opted for a multifunctional furniture item. Therefore, the most likely option is an apartment or a small house where space is limited. The option office does not make sense in this context."}

The only option that fits this description is the fridge freezer, which is a common household item used for storing food at low temperatures. The other options, such as the Gulf of Mexico, fish market, grocery store, and North Sea, do not have any clear connection to the idea of a cold environment."}

Out of the given options, a sporting goods store is the most likely place to have a wide variety of sports equipment available for purchase or rent. Sears is a department store that may sell some sports equipment but not as specialized as a sporting goods store. A pool is a location and not a place to buy sports equipment. A sporting event is not typically a place to acquire equipment, and a school may have limited resources and may not have a variety of equipment available."}

The phrase \"having sex long\" may mean engaging in sexual activity for a prolonged period of time, but it could also be interpreted as wanting to have fulfilling sexual experiences over a long period of time. The options \"sell beer,\" \"herpes,\" and \"cost money\" have no clear connection with the context of the sentence, leaving \"wonderful thing\" and \"last hour\" as the possible answers. Based on the positive tone of the sentence, \"wonderful thing\" is the more likely option."}

England is a well-known example of a country where people drive on the left, including on motorways. The other options, such as Europe or a river, are too broad or unrelated to the context and do not provide any specific information to guide the answer. New Jersey and city are also incorrect choices as they are not countries but specific regions or places within the United States."}

Expensive clothing and garments may not necessarily be made of silk, and downtown is too broad a location to determine where silk might be sold. Nightgown is a type of clothing made from silk, but it does not provide any information on where it might be bought."}

She was going to remodel her front garden, but she couldn't because of zoning rules.  Such was the perils of living where?"}}, "k": "urban area\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that zoning rules prevented Sally from carrying out her plans to remodel her front garden. Zoning rules generally apply in urban areas, where there are regulations on how homes and properties may be used. None of the other options in the answer choices mention zoning rules or have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Besides, it was too dry to find many.  Where might he have been?"}}, "k": "new hampshire\nKnowledge: The context suggests that the setting is probably a location where fox hunting is common, but the weather is too dry for it to be a successful endeavor. New Hampshire has a history of fox hunting, but also experiences dry periods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

It functions as a central information point and is responsible for handling check-ins, reservations, and guest inquiries. Since the reception desk is a mainstay in the hospitality industry, it is typically positioned in the lobby of the hotel, where it can be easily accessed by arriving guests. The other options do not provide a suitable location for the reception desk."}

She learned the hard way when buying new clothes.  What size might she have worn?"}}, "k": "large\nKnowledge: The first sentence implies that Sarah has grown up and is no longer a child. The second sentence suggests that she had difficulty buying new clothes, which could mean that she outgrew her old clothes and needed to purchase larger sizes. \"Large\" is the most appropriate choice among the options given, as it directly relates to size.

A river, on the other hand, may have a more straightforward flow, making it easier to navigate. Garage and boattail do not have any connection to water, while Indiana is a state and not a body of water."}

The drug store and dentist office are more likely to sell dental hygiene products but may not have groceries. The mouth and attic are not places where one would buy toothbrushes and food. The grocery store is the most appropriate place for the man to have gone."}

The swaying and the music gives her a feeling of what?"}}, "k": "euphoria\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Janet enjoys dancing because it gives her a specific feeling. The words \"swaying\" and \"music\" imply that she is experiencing a pleasurable sensation while dancing.

They are designed to hold and display various products on shelves or carts, and make it easier for customers to locate what they need.

The phrase \"turn his house into\" implies that his fear is about his house becoming something undesirable due to the hot tub being public knowledge. Out of the choices given, \"country club\" makes the most sense as it is a type of exclusive club that has facilities such as pools and hot tubs that are only available to members. The other options, such as \"health center\" or \"hospital,\" do not fit the context of the sentence."}

Books often contain visual images, such as illustrations or photographs, alongside a narrative or descriptive text to tell a story. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Where might he have gotten the blanket from?"}}, "k": "bed\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James used a blanket from his own personal belongings to cover the burn marks on the floor. The options \"synagogue,\" \"table,\" \"carpet,\" and \"general store\" are unlikely sources for a blanket in this context, as they do not have any clear connection to James or his home."}

She just wanted to enjoy herself. But it turned to be anything but. What did it turn out to be?"}}, "k": "get arrested\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah made a poor decision and ended up experiencing negative consequences. Specifically, it suggests that she may have been caught using a fake ID while attempting to purchase beer, which would likely result in being arrested. The other options do not fit the context provided and do not match the tone of the sentence."}

The word \"employee\" suggests that the chief oversees the people who work for the company. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "3852cd64dbc5bc5541eb2ab1511f0c55", "question": {"question_concept": "flirting", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "joyfulness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "smile"}, {"label": "C", "text": "getting excited"}, {"label": "D", "text": "enthusiasm"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sexual attraction"}], "stem": "She was giggling and flirting, his mustache elicited what for her?"}}, "k": "sexual attraction\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was caused by the man's mustache, which implies that it is a physical trait that is visually appealing to her. This suggests that the answer is related to attraction or desire, rather than more general positive emotions like joyfulness or enthusiasm. The use of the word \"flirting\" also supports the idea that there is a mutual attraction or interest between the two individuals."}

An object that is orbiting is typically moving in a circular or elliptical path around a central object, which makes \"orbit\" the most logical choice. \"Sky\" is too general and doesn't specify a particular location or context, while \"outerspace\" and \"universe\" are too broad and could refer to any location beyond Earth's atmosphere. \"In a vacuum\" doesn't provide any information about the meteor's movement or location."}

The options \"learn to speak,\" \"adult,\" and \"died\" do not fit this idea. The word \"old\" is used twice in the sentence, indicating that age is a significant factor in the story, which rules out the option \"baby boy\" as the starting point. Therefore, the correct answer is \"old man.\""}

The only option on the list that is on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean near the United States is California. Florida is on the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean, and the other options are not specific enough or do not have a clear connection to the given context."}

Vineyards are more commonly associated with grape vines, and the south pole is a harsh environment that is not conducive to growing apple trees. While apples can potentially grow in parks, they are not typically found in abundance in those settings. An orchid is a type of flower, not a location for apple trees."}

Music stores often have areas where people can try out instruments before purchasing them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Billy wished he didn't come to this event.  Where was he?"}}, "k": "conference\nKnowledge: The sentence describes a presenter talking to an audience with the aid of a projector displaying slides on a wall, which is a common feature of a conference or business meeting. The other options, such as movies, theatre, or showing films, do not fit the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer."}

The phrase \"demanded it\" implies that there was some external force that caused the change. The option \"unpleasant\" seems to be the best answer because unpleasant experiences often lead to personal growth and change. Stagnation, tradition, paper money, and wife do not necessarily suggest an external force that would demand change."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "db03ae25a2b29fd38e6b8ebdbac6e726", "question": {"question_concept": "helm", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "motorboat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "south tyrol"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tugboat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "brig"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sailing vessel"}], "stem": "The helm is the steering control of what powered leisure vessel?"}}, "k": "motorboat\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions a \"powered leisure vessel,\" which refers to a type of boat that is propelled by an engine rather than wind or oars. The helm is the steering control of such a vessel, which is commonly found on motorboats. The other options, such as sailboats or tugboats, are not typically referred to as \"powered leisure vessels\" and would therefore not fit the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not provide any tangible item that is required for reading. However, the option \"concentration\" appears twice among the choices - this is likely just a mistake, as it would not make sense for an option to be duplicated like this. Therefore, the correct answer is \"written material,\" because without written material (such as a book or article), there can be no reading."}

The given choices suggest different forms of communication, but only \"email\" is a communication method that typically requires a response. \"Mute\" is not an action that relates to communication and \"fax\" and \"send\" imply sending out information rather than receiving it. \"Answer\" is a possible option, but \"email\" is more specific to the context of receiving something while at work."}

The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Deep dive\" and \"fall\" are unrelated to the concept of time or the sun, while \"lower\" and \"below\" are vague and do not provide a clear indication of what happens at the end of the day."}

Therefore, it makes sense that a bee would like a gift of flowers, such as a bouquet. The other options do not have any clear connection to bees or their preferences."}
