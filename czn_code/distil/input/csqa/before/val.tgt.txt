The sentence suggests that the children had a positive reaction to being given ice cream, since the word "enjoyed" implies a sense of pleasure or satisfaction. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "awesome" could be a possible answer if the sentence was describing someone's reaction to hearing about the ice cream, but it doesn't make sense as a response to actually receiving it. "Play chess" and "skip" are unrelated and have no relevance to the sentence. "Sadness" is the opposite of what one would expect in response to being given ice cream.
The question is asking where air can be found to fill up balloons. The option "balloon" does not make sense as it refers to the object being filled, not the source of air. "Space shuttle" and "clouds" are not plausible sources of air for filling balloons. "House" may have air, but it is not a common place where people fill balloons. "Supermarket" is a likely answer as they often sell small canisters of compressed air for filling balloons.
The sentence implies that the gangster is used to killing people and it has become a part of his lifestyle. However, the use of the word 'surely' suggests that there might be a chance of him feeling regret for his actions. This indicates that he might feel remorse. The other options do not make sense in the context of this sentence.
The sentence implies that the person already has many friends, but continues to socialize. This suggests that they are seeking something beyond just having fun and may have a desire for more social status or popularity. Option C, "become more popular," directly references this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options are either too general or not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that professors use a particular method to prove their points. "State facts" is the most direct and logical answer because professors often use research or other evidence to support their arguments. The other options, such as "teach courses" or "master physics," do not describe a specific way that professors prove their points.
The sentence implies that there is a potential consequence to tripping while playing basketball. The most likely outcome is that you would hurt yourself, as falling while playing sports can often result in injuries. The other options, such as sweat and dribbling, are not relevant to the question and do not describe what would happen if you tripped. Making baskets is the objective of the game, not a consequence of tripping.
The sentence suggests that Laura and Bob are having a calm and rational conversation regarding a sensitive topic. The use of words such as "tentative agreement" and "negotiation" suggests that the conversation is being conducted in a calm and measured manner. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they suggest a more emotional and reactive response.
The sentence states that James is worried about committing perjury, which is a crime. Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law, which is a serious offense that can result in jail time. Therefore, it makes sense that James would be afraid he'll go to jail if he participates in Bob's plan. The other choices are also negative consequences, but they do not specifically relate to the crime of perjury.
The question is asking about emotions related to not getting paid which implies that the situation being discussed is a lack of financial compensation for work. "Sorrow" is a fitting emotion in this context as not getting paid can be a source of disappointment, worry, or even desperation. The other options, such as "income tax" and "blissfulness," do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the news revealed by the senator was something that caused a stir or created a dispute. Controversy is a word often used to describe situations in which different opinions or beliefs clash, which could be the case when a senator reveals information about a governor's office. The other options do not necessarily describe an appropriate reaction to this type of situation.
The sentence suggests that starting a fire on purpose is illegal and can lead to consequences. Going to jail is a common punishment for breaking the law, and starting fires without proper permits or in restricted areas is a crime in many places. Death or burns are potential physical consequences of starting a fire, but they are not the expected outcome if someone is caught. Warmth and a reward are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense as answers.
The question asks what could cause someone to be staying healthy, which implies a long-term state of physical well-being. Long life is a common outcome of healthy behaviors such as eating well, exercising regularly, and avoiding risky behaviors like smoking or excessive drinking. The other options are not directly related to physical health, and in some cases may even have a negative impact on health (such as budget cuts leading to a lack of access to healthcare).
The sentence indicates that the speaker uses clothing as a way to express themselves. The use of "even ugly clothing" suggests that the speaker is not necessarily using their attire to be fashionable or to have fun, but rather to communicate something about themselves or their mood. The option "communication" is the most fitting choice, as it directly relates to the context of the sentence. "Embarrassment" may also seem possible, but since the sentence does not suggest that the speaker is intentionally embarrassing themselves, it is not the best answer.
A harbor is a designated area of water that is protected and sheltered from rough currents and waves, making it a safe space for boats to dock and anchor. The other options, such as at sea, lake, or ocean, do not necessarily guarantee safety and may have unpredictable water conditions. While boats do typically operate on water, the question specifically asks for a safe space, indicating the need for a protected area.
The sentence suggests that there were warnings about not doing something near a printer, and that people were not following those warnings. The correct option must be something that people might do near a printer that could cause problems. Drinking coffee is a common activity that could pose a risk to a printer if the liquid is spilled or the steam causes condensation on the sensitive components. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Bees are commonly found in natural settings, such as gardens, parks, and the countryside. They are attracted to flowers and other vegetation, which provide them with nectar and pollen. A single bee is less likely to be found in a crowded or urban area, such as a soft drink or the United States in general. A swarm of bees refers to a large group of bees, and an apiary is a place where bees are kept and managed.
The use of the term "train" suggests that the ticket booth is located in a place where trains are commonly used as a mode of transportation. Among the given choices, a metro station is the most likely candidate for having a ticket booth that sells train tickets. The other options are not associated with train travel, making them unlikely choices for the location of a train ticket booth.
The sentence suggests that while resting, you are trying to do something specific. The given answer choices include words like lazy and laziness, which do not indicate any particular goal. Falling asleep may be a part of relaxation, but it is not the same thing. Feel better could be a possible goal of resting, but it is too general to be the correct answer. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is relaxation, which implies the intentional pursuit of a calm and peaceful state of mind and body.
The phrase "require a large amount of thinking" suggests that the person is trying to solve a problem or come up with a solution. "Fatigue" and "depression" are negative states of mind that would likely hinder a person's ability to think critically. "Best way" and "new perspectives" do not necessarily imply a difficult problem that requires extensive thinking. Therefore, "figure out" is the best answer choice.
A terrarium is a closed container designed for keeping small plants or animals that require a controlled environment. Zoological parks often have exhibits of reptiles, such as snakes, in terrariums. The other options do not make sense in the context of a zoological park: Kew Gardens is a botanical garden, a tree is unlikely to be an exhibit for snakes, a thick forest is not a controlled environment, and a field is too open and uncontrolled for displaying snakes.
The question is asking about the consequences of not drinking enough. Thirst is a common symptom of dehydration, which occurs when the body doesn't have enough fluids to function properly. While headaches, sickness, vomiting, and other symptoms can also be associated with dehydration, thirst is the most direct and immediate consequence of not drinking enough water.
The sentence suggests that jealousy can arise when two people engage in a certain behavior. The options "wage war" and "destroy relationship" imply a negative interaction between two people, but do not specifically suggest the behavior that leads to jealousy. "Judge" implies a one-sided action, without necessarily involving another person. "Compete," on the other hand, describes a situation where two people are striving for the same goal and may feel jealous of each other's successes or abilities. Therefore, "compete" is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the terrace was designed and constructed intentionally and with an artistic flair. The most likely option from the choices is a firm specializing in architecture, as they would have the knowledge and expertise to create such a complex and visually appealing structure. The other options, such as a rice paddy or financial firm, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there will be a consequence for someone who commits murder, even if they are not caught. The phrase "own death" implies that the consequence will be related to the person who committed the murder, rather than an external punishment like imprisonment or incarceration. It is also a widely recognized cultural belief that karma or guilt may eventually catch up with an individual who has committed a grave crime like murder. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James packed everything, including his peanut butter, into a single object. The most logical object for him to pack everything into, including a jar of peanut butter, would be a container, such as a jar. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A soprano is a type of female singer with a high-pitched voice, typically used in opera. An opera house is a venue specifically designed to host opera performances, and is where a soprano would most likely perform live for money. A movie or theater may also feature live performances, but they are not typically associated with operatic singing. A choit and choir are not even words, and are not relevant options.
The question implies that being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands has a positive impact on the world. The phrase "help people" is the only option that suggests a benefit to others, which aligns with the idea of doing something good for the world. The other options, such as "gain" or "add to," do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person brought their wallet with them because they intended to buy something. Buying products typically involves the exchange of money for goods or services, which requires having money, or spending money. The other options do not fit the context of someone bringing their wallet with them to make a purchase.
The sentence suggests that the person in question suffered a broken leg from their fall. Getting a cast is a common treatment for a broken leg, which would help to immobilize the bone and promote healing. The other options do not make sense in the context of a broken leg and falling down. Trying to learn or feeling proud are not relevant to the physical injury, catching a cold is unrelated, and needing assistance is too general to be a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for an alternative source of water due to concerns about the cleanliness of the current one, which is likely a water fountain. A kettle or teapot would not be used for drinking straight from the spout, and a garage or gasoline can have no relevance to the context.
The sentence suggests that James does not enjoy watching other people play baseball, which means that he likely finds it uninteresting or tedious. This feeling is commonly described as boredom which is the opposite of enjoyable. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When a person is intoxicated, their cognitive abilities and memory recall may be impaired, leading to forgetfulness of events that occurred while they were drunk. Stumbling and passing out are physical symptoms of being drunk, while a hangover typically occurs the next day and does not explain why someone would not remember where they left something while they were drunk. Confusion may be a symptom of intoxication, but forgetfulness is a more direct explanation for not remembering where something was left.
Committing a murder is a serious crime that carries a potential punishment of imprisonment. The other options are not appropriate consequences for committing murder. Feeling guilty may be a personal reaction, but it is not a legal consequence. Being rewarded is completely unrelated and fear is not a direct consequence of being accused of a murder.
When buying something new, it is common to receive a manual or instruction booklet that provides information on how to use the product, troubleshoot any issues, and handle maintenance. Manuals are often provided in physical form, but may also be available online. Books and pamphlets may also provide information, but they are not typically associated with a specific product or purchase as directly as a manual is. Meeting is not a typical source of information when buying something new.
Hard breathing when sick can be caused by respiratory problems such as inflammation, congestion or infection in the lungs or airways. Respiration refers to the process by which the body takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide during breathing. The other options do not relate to the physiological process of breathing or respiratory health.
Going to play is typically associated with positive emotions, such as enjoyment and happiness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "happy." The other options, while related to positive emotions, don't necessarily fit the context of the question. For example, "being entertained" implies that someone else is doing the entertaining, which may not be the case if a child is just going to play on their own. "Surprised" and "meet" don't fit the context at all.
The sentence suggests that the cardboard box is not usable anymore, and therefore it needs to be disposed of. The most appropriate place to put such a box is in the trash. The other options do not make sense in the given context. The warehouse might be a good place to store boxes that can be used, the post office deals with sending packages and not disposing of them, food has no connection to the context, and a garage is a place to park cars and not dispose of boxes.
The word "omnipotent" means having unlimited power and therefore the ability to do anything. The word "often" suggests that this depiction is common or widely accepted. While God may be associated with other actions like providing peace or judgement, the word "omnipotent" specifically refers to the ability to do anything. The options "home" and "everywhere" are not in line with the definition of omnipotence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the reception is being held in close proximity to a golf course. In this scenario, it is likely that the reception would take place at a country club, which typically has a golf course on its premises. The other options, such as a large room or a church basement, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A golf cart and a lobby are also unlikely venues for a reception.
The sentence indicates that Southern is being contrasted with another geographic direction, which would be its opposite. Out of the choices given, northern is the most commonly used antonym of southern. The other options, such as southernwort, boreal or septentrional, do not have any clear relation to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to buy peas locally, which implies they are looking for a place that sells fresh produce. While all the options may sell peas, only the farmer's market specifically emphasizes locally sourced and fresh produce. The other options may sell peas that are frozen or shipped from far away, but they do not meet the criterion of being local and fresh.
The sentence suggests that the old lady is in a store looking for a can of paint, and the employee is helping her. The employee got the can of paint "for her," which suggests it was taken from a specific location that the employee knew where to find. The most likely location for a can of paint in a store would be on a shelf, as opposed to a wall, hardware store, paintbrush, or windowsill.
The sentence suggests that the location is a place where deep fryers are used, which is a common piece of equipment in restaurants. Restaurants also tend to be busy places where food is prepared and served, which matches the description given in the sentence. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not involve food preparation or the use of deep fryers.
The sentence implies that people who are not influenced by the morals of a higher power (i.e. religion) have greater freedom to explore and think about scientific concepts. Therefore, they are more likely to come up with new and innovative ideas. The other options do not necessarily follow from the sentence's context.
The sentence suggests that Bob wants to talk but is unable to do so because of the presence of gnats. "Speaking up" would mean raising his voice in order to overcome the disturbance caused by the gnats. The other options do not address the issue of Bob being unable to communicate due to the presence of gnats.
The question is asking about what a head attaches to, which suggests that the answer is a body part. Among the choices, "neck" is the only body part mentioned, and it is also the most commonly associated body part for a head to attach to. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the question.
When meeting people for the first time, it is common to introduce oneself. This helps establish a connection and can lead to further conversation. Hugging and making friends are not appropriate actions until after an introduction has been made. Smiling is a friendly gesture, but does not establish a formal introduction. Shaking hands is another common way to greet someone in a formal setting.
Blowfish are a type of fish that are commonly found in coral reefs. Therefore, it is likely that an image of a blowfish would be found in a depiction or photograph of a coral reef environment. The other options do not have any clear connection to blowfish.
The sentence suggests that the change is not needed immediately, so it should be stored somewhere. The most logical option would be a jar or container, which can hold loose change and be easily accessible when needed. The other options do not provide logical storage solutions for change - putting it in a purse or pocket could result in it being lost or spent, a slot machine is not a storage option, and a casino is not a practical place to store loose change.
The sentence suggests that the sound of the band's performance was not actually live, but rather pre-recorded. The word "previously" indicates that the sound was not produced in real-time during the live performance, but was instead recorded beforehand. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the question is related to socializing with friends through chatting. While love, answers, inspiration, and relaxation can be reasons for socializing, the word "fun" is commonly associated with engaging in activities with friends. Chatting is often seen as a social activity where people exchange humorous or entertaining messages, catch up on each other's lives, and simply enjoy each other's company. The other options are less likely to be the main reason why people engage in chatting with friends.
The sentence suggests that graveyards are typically located outside of a specific group of homes and businesses. The options "Arlington," "church property," and "every town" do not provide any clear indication of the type of location being referred to. The option "city" is the most likely choice, as graveyards are often located on the outer edges of urban areas rather than in the middle of them.
The sentence suggests that learning more about your weakest subjects will have a positive effect on you. The phrase "improve yourself" implies personal growth and development, which can be achieved through acquiring knowledge in areas where one is struggling. The other options are not specific enough to describe the outcome of learning more about your weakest subjects.
The sentence suggests that running is a skill that is built on top of another skill. Before someone can run, they need to learn how to walk. This is a developmental milestone that most people go through as children. Stretches and buying shoes are related to running, but they don't address the fundamental skill needed to start running. "Act quickly" and "go quickly" are also not related to developing the skill needed to run.
The sentence suggests that the investor may not have had his client's best interests in mind, as he kept insisting that the client had to spend money. The phrase "make money" is commonly associated with investing, as the goal of investing is typically to earn a profit. The other options, such as "go shopping" or "steal money," do not make sense in the context of an investment scenario.
The sentence implies that the person in question is talented but reluctant to perform, which suggests a potential lack of confidence or discomfort with being in the spotlight. Anxiety is a common psychological condition characterized by feelings of apprehension or dread, which could explain why this person doesn't enjoy performing despite their talent. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or are incorrect.
Crushed ice is commonly used to cool drinks as it quickly lowers the temperature of the liquid. Liquid nitrogen is too cold and dangerous to handle, a steam room would only make the water hotter, tidal waves and oceans have no relevance to the question.
Bald eagles are birds and are commonly housed in aviaries in zoological parks. The other options are not relevant to the natural habitat or living situation of a bald eagle. Bald eagles are also commonly associated with the United States, particularly Washington D.C. where they are the national bird and seal, but this does not necessarily mean they would be found there in a zoological park.
The sentence suggests that to understand someone better in a serious relationship requires something that takes a certain amount of duration or duration itself. Effort, consistency, thinking, and knowledge of someone can all be beneficial in building a relationship, but they don't necessarily require a specific amount of time to accomplish. The only answer that fulfills this requirement is "time."
The fact that the shark kept bumping into piers suggests that it is in a location with man-made structures such as a harbor or bay. San Francisco Bay is a famous location for sharks to get trapped due to the Golden Gate Bridge and other structures. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence refers specifically to a brass instrument, which is commonly used in marching bands. Members of marching bands typically carry their instruments while they play, as they are required to move in formations during performances. The other options, such as jazz band or punk rock band, do not necessarily require the musician to carry their instrument while playing. "Annoy mom" is clearly not a relevant option.
The sentence implies that the man's poor references are preventing him from getting a job, suggesting that he needs to work on his reputation. Being reputable means having a good and respectable reputation, which is important for employment prospects. The other options don't relate to the context of the sentence and may even suggest an opposite meaning (e.g. being famous doesn't necessarily equate to being good at getting a job).
The sentence suggests that John was lying on his back and looking up at a bright light source. This is most likely the sky, as the other options (lamp, hallway, dark, closed room) do not fit the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that John initially thought there was a door suggests that he was in an enclosed space, so it is unlikely that he would be looking at a hallway or a dark room.
The sentence states that Simon was meeting Jane in the afternoon, so it can be assumed that he needed to finish his project before that time. The options "evening" and "before lunch" are not consistent with the information given in the sentence. The option "after" is too vague and does not provide a specific time frame. The option "morning" is too early and does not match the time of the planned meeting.
The adage being described suggests that it is not wise to mix two specific things together, one of which is business. The other option that makes the most sense to pair with business is pleasure, as it suggests that engaging in activities solely for enjoyment or personal gratification may not be conducive to conducting business in a professional manner. The other options do not fit the context of the adage.
The sentence suggests that the two individuals were considering going out for coffee, which could be expensive. The use of the word "just" indicates that the woman found an alternative option that was more budget-friendly, so she had the coffee at a different location. Among the choices given, only "friend's house" could be a budget-friendly option for having coffee. The other options, such as parent's house or grocery store, do not make sense in the context of having coffee.
The context of the sentence implies that John wanted a silo home due to its energy efficiency. Silo homes are typically made by repurposing old grain silos, and the thick walls of the silo provide insulation that helps regulate temperature. One common method of insulation for silo homes is to stack layers of used tires inside the silo walls, which traps air and provides a high level of insulation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a place that humans do not often go, and the options are all different types of locations. A bus and an apartment building are both common places that humans go to. A space shuttle is a vehicle that humans use to go to space, so it is not a location where humans do not often go. Inside the Earth also refers to places where humans have explored before, such as caves or mines. The solar system, on the other hand, refers to the entire system of planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies that are not easily accessible or explored by humans. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that moving cars without looking can lead to negative consequences. Accidents are a common result of not paying attention while driving, and this option is the most closely related to the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential outcome of not looking while moving cars.
The sentence suggests that the answer involves something that can be extended in order to increase the size of a backyard. In this context, "property" refers to the land on which a house is built, and extending one's property could involve purchasing additional land or negotiating with neighbors to acquire part of their land. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "ladder" is associated with climbing to a higher level. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The context of the sentence implies that Bill is looking to make a lot of money quickly and while sailing in a specific location, the Caribbean. The option "treasure chest" makes the most sense as it aligns with the idea of finding a valuable stash of money or goods that may have been hidden in the area during pirate times. The other options such as a bank, stock market or even real estate are unlikely to provide the quick and substantial returns that Bill seeks in this context.
A wagon meant for work would likely be used outdoors, and therefore would be best kept in a location that is easily accessible from the outside. Of the choices given, only the backyard fits this criteria. The garage and kitchen cabinet are typically indoor locations, while the field would not provide adequate protection for the wagon from the elements. The toy store is not a relevant option for storing a work wagon.
The sentence suggests that Dan was content with his current lifestyle in a big city, but he felt like something was missing. The most likely answer is that he was searching for happiness, as this is a common pursuit for people who feel unfulfilled. The other options are not related to Dan's situation or are unlikely answers based on the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James uses television as a form of relaxation or leisure activity after a hard day's work. The word "entertained" implies that he enjoys watching TV and finds it enjoyable. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "laziness" implies that James is being unproductive or avoiding work, "falling asleep" implies that watching TV makes him sleepy, "visual" does not make sense in this context, and "conformity" has no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the physiologist identified a bone, which is a part of a skeleton. Therefore, the correct answer is skeleton. The other options are not directly related to bones, as vertebrates and fresh fish can have bones but are not specifically about identifying a bone. Fossil refers to something that is preserved from a past geological age and cannot be identified in real-time, and dog's mouth is too specific and unrelated to the context of identifying a bone.
The other options may provide temporary distractions from boredom, but reading a book can offer a more long-lasting solution as it engages the mind and can provide a sense of fulfillment. Additionally, reading has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce stress, making it a healthy and productive way to deal with boredom.
The phrase "reaching advantage" implies that the boxer has a longer reach than their opponent. A longer reach can help the boxer land punches from a safer distance and keep their opponent at bay. This can ultimately lead to a greater chance of winning the match, or achieving victory. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that John saw a plate and silverware set aside specifically for him, which implies that he was either at a table or in a dining setting. Therefore, the most likely answer is "table." While "restaurant" could be a possible answer, it is less specific and could refer to any location where food is served. "In a train" and "kitchen" do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not imply a dining scenario.
The term "passing sentence" refers to a legal process where a judge issues a verdict or penalty. After such a sentence is issued, it is possible for the convicted person to file an appeal to challenge the ruling. Therefore, the correct answer is "appeals." The other options, such as death, grief, anger, and grammar, are not related to the legal system or the process of passing sentence.
The sentence implies that the speaker wants to make bread quickly because he is hungry and wants to eat. The other options do not fit logically with the context of the sentence.
The question implies that kissing has some positive effect, and the options suggest various positive outcomes. "Feeling good" is the most general and neutral among the options, and it can be applied to different kinds of kissing (e.g., romantic, friendly, familial). While some kissing may lead to arousal, sexual excitement, or pleasure, these options are more specific and may not always be true for everyone. "Being happy" is also a general positive outcome, but it is too broad and may not be directly related to kissing.
The use of the term "protected" suggests that the location being referred to is likely an area where certain species are safeguarded or conserved. A national park is a protected area designated by a government for the conservation of natural resources and wildlife, making it the best fit among the other options listed. A zoo typically refers to a controlled environment where animals are kept for public exhibition, while a burrow is a hole dug by a small animal as a dwelling. The American West does not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence. The term "in the wild" is too broad and does not offer any specific information about the location being referred to.
The sentence suggests that the place being described has a lower ceiling than other areas. The attic is typically located at the top of a building and has a sloping roof, which means that the ceiling is usually closer to the floor than in other areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Remembering every answer on a test is likely to show that the person has a good understanding of the material and has acquired knowledge as a result of studying. Nostalgia and depression are unrelated to the context of the question. Problems may be a result of not remembering answers on a test, but the question asks about the act of remembering every answer. Instruction is also unrelated to the context of the question.
The phrase "full bloom" suggests that the garden is at its peak of beauty, with all the flowers and plants in full bloom. This is a time when the garden is most vibrant, colorful and fragrant, making it the most beautiful. The other options do not relate to the concept of a garden's beauty.
The sentence is asking about an emotional response to winning against a challenging opponent. "Pride" is an emotion commonly associated with feeling good about oneself for accomplishing something, especially when it is difficult or requires effort. "Encouraging" and "one winner" do not accurately describe an emotional response, and "injury" is not related to the context of the sentence. "Proud" is a synonymous choice to "pride."
The sentence suggests that Bailey initially thought they saw something scary, but upon closer examination, they realized it was just a person. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person has an indoor plant that they enjoy, but it requires specific conditions to thrive. The word "sunny" suggests that the ficus plant needs an adequate amount of sunlight to grow well. Additionally, the other options like tropical forest, ecosphere, and tropical rainforest are not relevant to the context of the sentence as they describe outdoor environments rather than indoor conditions.
The sentence suggests that John's brain was not functioning properly, which could cause it to fool him or deceive him in some way. The phrase "play tricks on" is often used to describe situations where something appears one way but is actually something else, which could be a symptom of an impaired mental state. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Taking a bath is typically done in a private and comfortable setting, which is most likely to be one's own home. The other options do not offer the same level of privacy and convenience that is associated with taking a bath at home.
The sentence suggests that the person was already heading home, which means they were most likely already at their lodging. Since the sentence mentions a gift shop, it is likely that the lodging they were staying at had one. Out of the given choices, only a hotel or a resort are common places to stay where a gift shop would be present. The other options such as an airport or a museum are less likely to have gift shops. Disneyland is a theme park and not a lodging, so it would not be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the machine for making bread is kept in a place where it can be accessed frequently for personal use. The options "laboratory," "museum," and "industrial area" do not fit in this context as they suggest that the machine is part of a larger production or scientific process rather than for individual use. The option "bathroom" is unlikely as it is not a common place to keep kitchen appliances, making "house" the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that ice has a specific function or purpose. Based on common knowledge and context, ice is commonly used to cool drinks and food, or to cool down a person's body temperature. The other options do not align with the functional purpose of ice or the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a common place where people keep money that is not in their wallet. Bank accounts are the most common place for people to keep their money as they offer security and the ability to earn interest. The other options, such as outside or at a race track or casino, are unlikely places for people to keep their money as they are not secure or reliable. An art show may involve selling artwork, but it is not a common place for people to store their money.
The description of the players' physical reactions (getting chills and goosebumps) suggests that they were entering a space that was eerie, scary, or awe-inspiring. This would be an apt description of a tomb, which is associated with death and can often be dark and creepy. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - an arena, for example, might be exciting or fun rather than scary, and water or a public building would not typically be associated with the physical sensations described.
The sentence suggests that the baboon is a species of monkey that is native to a specific region. The option "african continent" is the most likely answer because baboons are commonly found in various parts of Africa. The other options, such as "amazon basin" and "rain forest," are associated with South America and may be home to other monkey species, but not baboons. "Zoological gardens" is a man-made location where baboons may be found but is not their native habitat.
Making friends typically involves some form of communication or interaction, which is best achieved through talking. The other options are not typical behaviors associated with making friends - falling in love may happen as a result of a friendship, but it is not a typical starting point; smiling can convey friendliness, but it does not necessarily lead to a friendship; starting a fight is not a friendly behavior; and getting drunk may hinder one's ability to make friends.
The context of the sentence indicates that the person is feeling pride when they see their team and size up the opposing team, which suggests that they are about to compete against the other team. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and there is no indication that the person is about to do anything related to passing a class, painting a house, improving themselves, or playing hopscotch.
The sentence suggests that the station chose not to censor the show, which implies that the content could potentially be controversial or offensive. If the station remained neutral or animated, they would be unlikely to allow such content to air without censorship. Additionally, the use of the phrase "no tape delay" suggests that the station was willing to take the risk of airing potentially controversial content without giving themselves a buffer to edit or cut out any inappropriate material. These factors suggest that the correct answer is "biased," meaning that the station allowed potentially controversial or biased material to be aired without censorship. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the reason behind wanting to get warm when someone is feeling cold. The most logical answer is to feel comfortable because being cold can be uncomfortable and unpleasant. The other options do not provide a clear rationale for wanting to get warm when cold, such as doing somersaults or becoming more comfortable (which doesn't explain why one would want to become more comfortable).
The use of the word "stage" suggests that the room is likely a performance or presentation space. While some of the other options could potentially have stages (such as a school auditorium or a church), the mention of a folding chair and the lack of any other descriptive details points towards a more generic, less permanent performance space like an auditorium.
The sentence implies that when someone does not want something, they take a specific action towards it. "Stockpile" means to accumulate large quantities of something, which is not applicable in this context. "Reject" means to dismiss or refuse something, which makes it the correct choice. "Negative" and "detest" are emotions or attitudes that someone might have towards something, but they do not indicate a specific action. Therefore, "refuse" is the best answer based on the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that the purpose of listening to music in this particular scenario is to unwind or relax. Therefore, the correct answer should be a word that conveys a sense of relaxation. The options "enjoyable," "fun," "pleasurable," and "entertainment" could all be used to describe music, but they do not necessarily imply relaxation. However, the word "relaxing" specifically describes the effect that music has in this context, making it the correct answer.
When looking for information about human ancestors, gravesites are a logical place to start. Gravesites can provide information about ancestors' names, birth and death dates, and family relationships. Memorial sites may honor ancestors, but they are generally not places where one would go to gather information about ancestors. Schools and interesting places may have historical information, but they are not specifically related to finding information about human ancestors. A temperate climate may be comfortable for exploring gravesites, but it is not directly related to finding information about ancestors.
The sentence suggests that the bad move the person made turned out to be unexpectedly fortunate for them. This indicates that they are now in a position that benefits them in some way, which aligns with the definition of advantageous. The other options do not have the same connotation of benefiting from a mistake or error.
The sentence is asking about where students do most of their learning, which implies a formal educational setting. The classroom is the most common and traditional setting for teaching and learning in schools, making it the most likely answer. The other options may offer opportunities for learning, but they are not the primary location for formal education.
The context of the question implies that the person is working at a desk or in an office setting, so keeping the eyeglasses case on their desk would be the most practical and convenient option. Keeping it in a drawer might make it difficult to access quickly, and keeping it in a bag or the car would require leaving the desk or workspace to retrieve it. Keeping it in a shirt pocket might be uncomfortable or not practical for everyone.
The question implies that the viewing is related to a task that is currently being performed. The most likely tool for displaying such information is a computer screen, as it is a common platform for managing tasks in many industries. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as they are not typically used for displaying task-related information.
The word "mediocre" suggests that Greg's performance was average or unremarkable. Therefore, it is unlikely that his habits would be distinguished, unique, exceptional, or outstanding. The word "peculiar" means unusual or strange, which could be a possible explanation for why Greg's performance was not impressive.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker put a towel in a cardboard box for a kitten. The word "wanted" indicates that they had a specific intention or goal in mind. The options "farmhouse" and "zoos" do not provide any useful information in this context. The option "cold place" is unlikely, as it would not be a suitable environment for a young animal. "Floor" is also unlikely, as the speaker would not have gone to the effort of putting a towel in a box if they intended for the kitten to sleep on the floor. "Warm place" is the most appropriate option, as it would ensure the kitten's comfort and safety.
The sentence suggests that a person who is focused on learning about science will be gaining some form of knowledge related to the field. The other options do not relate to science or learning in the same way. Atheism is a belief system, not a field of study or form of knowledge. Having fun and gaining new ideas may be potential outcomes of learning about science, but they are not the main focus or purpose of scientific education. Therefore, the correct answer is scientific knowledge.
The question suggests that humans are being kept in a confined space in large numbers, which is a characteristic of a prison. Prisons are designed to hold a large number of people in a limited space, often with minimal amenities or living conditions. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as humans are not typically kept in large numbers in small spaces in a solar system, school, apartment building, or bus.
The sentence suggests that this type of building is open to the general public and has an entrance hall that is commonly used by random citizens. Schools may be open to the public for events, but they typically have designated entrances for students and faculty. Large buildings and auditoriums can have public access, but the sentence emphasizes the use of an entrance hall, which suggests a more formal type of building. A convention center is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any clues as to whether the building hosts events or conferences, which are typically associated with convention centers. Therefore, the best answer is a public building, which can refer to a variety of government or community facilities that are open to the public.
The sentence directly states that the subject enjoyed fabric as a medium, which suggests that she worked with textiles in some capacity. The word "sew" is the only option that is specifically related to working with fabric. The other options, such as creating art, drawing, or writing, could potentially involve fabrics but are not directly related to the context of the sentence. "Express yourself" is a vague option that could apply to any medium, making it less likely to be the correct choice.
The word "cheap" suggests that the company was trying to save money, and not paying employees would be a way to reduce expenses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the detective was searching for the truth and was sifting through lies to do so. To find the truth, one would need to gather all the facts and evidence available to them. Asking questions would also be a useful strategy, but it is mentioned in the sentence that the detective was already searching, which implies that they were actively looking for information rather than just asking for it. Lying, wondering, and searching for are not directly related to the notion of discovering the truth through sifting through lies.
The sentence implies that the gathering of people is a place where a small dog will be happy. The option "grandma's house" may be the correct answer as it is a common stereotype that grandmas love spoiling furry creatures, including small dogs. The other options, such as "barbeque," "Canada," "baby carriage," and "basket," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that James and Lilly have strong feelings for each other, and to express those feelings, they kiss. This suggests that they are likely to engage in physical expressions of affection. Of the options given, only embrace is a physical expression of affection that would be likely in this situation. Shake hands and smile are too formal or platonic, while "falling in love" is not an action that can be taken at will.
The question is asking for a place of shelter in an urban context. The most obvious and practical answers would be either a homeless shelter or a house, as both provide protection from the elements and a secure space to stay in. A shelterbelt and tree would not be practical options for most people seeking shelter, while a bus stop may provide some temporary protection but is not a long-term or reliable solution. However, the correct answer may depend on the specific context of the question, such as if the focus is on providing shelter for homeless individuals or finding a place to stay during a natural disaster.
The sentence implies that the shirt was fastened with buttons, as the person started to unfasten it. The other options (pull up, zip up, tie up, do up) do not involve buttons and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The mention of an antique pirate artifact suggests that the object is likely to be old and potentially valuable. Additionally, the fact that John needed a lock specifically for this object implies that it is something that needs to be secured. Out of the given choices, firearm is the most likely to fit this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to pirates or the need for a lock.
The sentence presents a clear contrast between the woman's belief in fatalism and the man's belief in something related to personal agency or choice. The concept of free will directly opposes fatalism, as it asserts that individuals have control over their own actions and outcomes. The other answer choices may also be related to the context of the sentence, but they do not create a clear contrast with the woman's belief in fatalism.
The context of the sentence suggests that the contestants were waiting for their chance to perform on American Idol. The other options, while related to waiting, do not have any connection to the specific activity that the contestants were waiting to do. "Sing" is the only answer that fits with the context and provides a clear and concise response to the question.
The sentence suggests that the person saved up money for a new bass, which is most likely a musical instrument, and therefore they would need to go to a music store to purchase it. The other options have no connection to purchasing a bass.
The sentence mentions Tahiti, which is a destination located in the South Pacific. Sharks are often found in areas of open water, and the South Pacific is known to be home to numerous shark species. The other options such as the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean Sea are not associated with shark sightings near Tahiti. The pool hall is also an irrelevant option as it has nothing to do with geography or marine wildlife.
The sentence suggests that the hiring officer was looking for someone who could do a job that required following specific instructions. This is a common requirement for jobs that involve working in a military context, where precision and attention to detail are essential. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the specific skills that would be needed for the job.
Tinder is a dating app designed specifically for people who are looking for romantic relationships. Therefore, it is logical that the app would encourage meeting people as a way to find potential love interests. The other options, such as smile, anxiety, being happy, and making new friends, may be associated with meeting people, but they do not directly relate to the purpose of the app.
The term "wet terrace" is commonly used to refer to a type of rice cultivation where rice is grown on terraced fields that are irrigated with water. This method of cultivation is popular in many Asian countries like Japan, China, and Vietnam, and is commonly referred to as a "rice paddy." Therefore, it can be inferred that Jane is likely working on a rice paddy in one of these countries. The other options are not related to farming or agriculture in any way.
The sentence implies that the people were trying to prevent the parade from continuing, and they took some action to stop it. The option "roadblock" is the most logical answer as it is a common method of stopping traffic or preventing movement. The other options such as carnival, public place, apartment, and space shuttle have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence, therefore can be eliminated.
The sentence suggests that the small dog might be found in a location that is likely to be its home, such as a backyard. The mention of a white coat could also suggest that the dog is a breed that commonly has a white coat, which further supports the idea that it may be a pet dog. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The verb "gawked" implies that the woman was staring at the diamonds in wonder or admiration. The adjective "pretty" is commonly used to describe something that is visually appealing, making it the most likely choice. "Rare" and "translucent" may describe the diamonds accurately, but they do not necessarily reflect the woman's reaction to them. "Edible" is obviously not a plausible choice.
The question implies that the book is a form of entertainment or distraction from boredom, rather than a tool for learning or practical use. "Have fun" is the most appropriate answer in this context, as it suggests engaging with the book for enjoyment or leisure. The other options do not fit this context as well - "learn new" implies that the book is being used for educational purposes, "play chess" suggests the book may be a chess manual or contain chess puzzles, "go somewhere" is not related to the book at all, and "look pictures" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that John and Grace live in an area with a high population density, which might make it difficult for them to navigate their surroundings due to the large number of people. The other options don't fit with the context of the sentence: race tracks would have limited pedestrian traffic, opera houses would be indoor spaces, commotion is a general term for a noisy disturbance rather than a physical obstacle, and roadblocks would be an intentional obstruction rather than a natural result of living in a densely-populated area.
The sentence suggests that Billy used a spa as part of his injury rehabilitation, which is often recommended by doctors. The use of a spa for medical purposes would likely require a professional medical setting such as a health centre, not a house or backyard. Country clubs also typically do not have medical facilities. The option "leave" does not make sense in this context as it is not a location.
The sentence suggests that in order to eat lunch, there is a necessary step of doing something with the food. Shopping for food suggests a need to acquire ingredients, but does not imply any further action. Eating food and finding food suggest a completed task, rather than a step in the process of having lunch. Having time for lunch is important, but not relevant to the specific question of what is needed to eat lunch. Therefore, prepare food is the correct choice as it implies action needed to make food that is suitable for eating.
Drinking alcohol too fast can lead to a rapid increase in blood alcohol content, which can cause intoxication. This can lead to impaired judgment, loss of coordination and balance, and slurred speech. In more severe cases, it can also lead to vomiting. Nausea can also be a symptom of alcohol consumption, but it may not be a direct result of drinking too fast. "Having fun" and "intelligence" are not likely to be consequences of excessive alcohol consumption.
The sentence suggests that Billy's wife is arriving from France, which implies an international travel context. Out of the given options, the only place where international arrivals can be expected is an airport. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James does not appreciate being told what to do, which is a characteristic commonly associated with people who do not like being ordered around. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions driving too fast, which is commonly associated with breaking the speed limit. When a driver exceeds the speed limit, they are more likely to receive a speeding ticket. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the college student was looking for social interaction, but had a specific dislike for a certain activity. The option "go to parties" is the most likely choice as parties are a common social gathering for college students. The other options do not have a clear connection to social interaction or the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John gave away internet ready computers because he was an idealist who wanted to make a positive impact on the world. Giving away computers is an act of charity that can help people who may not have access to technology, which aligns with the idea of wanting to help others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person has specific preferences and only likes certain types of items. A specialty store often carries a selection of unique or niche products that may cater to specific tastes or interests. The other options, such as department stores or variety stores, may have a broader selection that may not cater to specific preferences. Christmas-related items, such as the Christmas tree and stocking, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the kid is tired of something that involves inactivity or lack of stimulation, which is best represented by the option "doing nothing." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they represent unrelated concepts such as emotions (serious, hatred) or entertainment (longplay, musical).
The sentence suggests that the man's beef allergy could result in severe consequences if he eats hamburger, which could potentially lead to death. This is because allergies can cause anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction. The other options do not reflect the seriousness of the situation described in the sentence.
The question is about where students keep rubber bands, which implies that the location should be related to their school environment. Among the given choices, only "classroom" is a setting associated with students and where they could keep rubber bands for school-related activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
While all of the choices listed could potentially be a type of ship in a battleship fleet, the use of the word "small" in the sentence suggests that the answer is likely to be a smaller type of ship. A corvette is a smaller, faster type of warship commonly used in the navy, and would fit the context of the sentence as the small ship in the fleet. The other options, such as a submarine or destroyer, may be smaller in comparison to larger ships in the fleet, but they do not typically carry the connotation of being a smaller type of ship in general. Additionally, "gambit" is not a type of ship at all, and "frigate" is typically larger than a corvette.
The question is asking about a tool used for removing water from a flooded room. The options "sink," "backhoe," "underground stream," and "hydroelectric dam" are not applicable, as they do not serve this purpose. A sump pump, on the other hand, is a device designed specifically for pumping water out of basements or other areas where water accumulates. This makes it the most logical choice among the given options.
The sentence implies that if you want to remember an event, there is something specific you should do while at it. "Focus on" is the most logical choice, as it suggests that you should actively pay attention to the details of the event and try to commit them to memory. "Take pictures" could also be a good option, but it implies that the person wants to preserve the memory visually rather than mentally. "Try" and "not forget" sound like vague instructions without any clear action attached to them, and "use a flame thrower" is obviously not relevant to the task at hand.
The question mentions using the head on the ball, which is a common technique in the sport of soccer. Soccer is a sport where players use their feet and head to manipulate the ball and score goals, while the other options do not necessarily involve this type of interaction with the ball. A sporting event, stadium or hockey game could refer to a variety of sports where using the head on the ball is not necessarily common practice, while head ball refers to a specific game that may not be popular or widely known.
The sentence suggests that Joe's skill in thinking and applying his thoughts to most situations had a positive impact and led to a specific outcome.  The term "solution to problem" directly relates to this idea and would be the most logical answer. The other options (sadness, depression, wonder) do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to Joe's skill in problem-solving.
The context of the sentence suggests that Bill is a customer of an electric company, so it is likely that he is calling about something related to his account. The most likely reasons he would be calling are to ask questions or to pay his bills. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence and don't make sense as reasons why Bill would be calling an electric company.
The sentence suggests that a drop of blood needs to be removed, which implies some unwanted blood stain. Out of the given choices, a razor blade is most commonly used to scrape off or cut away bloodstains from surfaces. A blood bank deals with storing and transferring blood, while a needle is used to draw blood. A slaughterhouse is a place where animals are killed for meat, and a person is too general to be a correct answer in this context.
The sentence suggests that the parents were concerned about something, but the teacher responded in a way that was opposed to their concerns. The words "uncaring," "carelessness," and "carefree" all indicate a lack of concern or attention, which does not fit with the context of the sentence. "Apathy" and "indifference" both suggest a lack of emotional engagement or concern, but "indifference" fits better with the idea of a direct opposition to the parents' concerns.
The question mentions "using a puck professionally," which suggests that the activity being referred to is a sport or game. The option "hockey rink" is the most directly related to this clue, as hockey is a sport that involves the use of a puck. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
After recording something and having it transcribed, it would be helpful to check for any spelling errors or inaccuracies in the transcription. Therefore, a spell checker or documentation of facts would be useful to ensure the accuracy of the transcription. Evidence, recorder, and tape do not necessarily relate to the task of checking for errors in a transcription.
The sentence suggests that the laundry room is not accessible to a large number of people, which is a characteristic commonly associated with a laundry room in the basement of an apartment building. A laundry room in a hospital or hotel would likely be used by a larger number of people, and a laundry room in a college or house would likely be accessible to more people on a regular basis.

The context of the question suggests that the person is staying in bed and not moving because they are either sleeping or resting. The word "doze" specifically means to sleep lightly or take a nap, which fits this context. The other options do not relate to the idea of resting or sleeping. "Very private" is not a reason to stay in bed, "picking fleas off your dog" has no connection to the context, and "read book" and "reading book" are duplicates of each other and do not address the question.
The question suggests that the large groups are trying to bring about change in society, and social activism is a commonly used method for achieving this goal. Social activism involves advocating for social or political change through nonviolent means, such as protests, petitions, and letter-writing campaigns. Riots, arguing, and demonstrating can sometimes be associated with social activism, but they are not always effective or constructive ways of creating lasting change. "Change yourself" does not fit the context of the question, as it does not involve changing society as a whole.
The context of the question suggests that the question is related to the hospitality industry, specifically in the service of food and drinks to customers. A waiter is a person who works in a restaurant and serves food and drinks to customers. Water is a common beverage that is served to customers, especially when they first sit down at the table. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there has been a killing and the police are involved in some way. It is likely that their role will be related to investigating the crime and trying to gather evidence to determine who is responsible. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence - a gun could be involved in a killing, but it is not a role that the police would have. Pleasure and punishment are also unlikely to be relevant to the situation. Dies is not a role or action that the police would take, but rather an outcome of the situation.
A sailor is more likely to be on a boat than an airplane or movie, so options (b), (c), and (d) can be eliminated. Additionally, in the context of a voyage, it makes sense that the suitcase would be stored in a place where other cargo is also stored, such as the cargo hold. Therefore, (a) is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the child has only seen jellyfish in a specific context and references a "tank," which is commonly associated with aquariums or other places where marine animals are kept for observation. The other options are all related to the ocean or sea, but do not provide any indication of a specific context or setting where the child may have seen jellyfish.
The sentence implies that fish are a good option for someone who is just starting to have pets. This is likely because they do not require as much attention or care as other animals, such as dogs or cats. Additionally, the sentence mentions cleaning the tank and feeding the fish, which are typical responsibilities of a pet owner. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was in a negative and potentially dangerous relationship where they did not feel safe. The use of the word "just" indicates that she did not want anything extravagant, but rather something basic like the feeling of safety. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence since they do not refer to a relationship.
Snoring is often a symptom of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, which is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Snoring can also be a sign of other sleep-related problems such as allergies, nasal congestion, or obesity. None of the other options are likely to be associated with snoring.
The coach's explanation of respect suggests that he wanted his players to treat the opposing team with dignity and not diminish their abilities or character. Belittling is a specific term used to describe making someone or something seem small or unimportant, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as contemn, diss, castrate, and disregard, do not have a clear connection to the context or meaning of the sentence.
The use of the term "ticket booth" suggests that it is a place where tickets are sold to attend a specific event. While these booths can be found in various locations, the options subway and train station are unlikely to have a separate booth for just one event. The terms auditorium and venue are more generic and can refer to many different types of events. The option stadium, however, is a specific location commonly associated with sporting events and concerts where a ticket booth is typically located outside the building.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to anatomy or human body parts. The option "someone's face" is the most fitting answer, as it is commonly known that people have two eyes located on their face. The other options, such as "potato" or "faces," do not make sense in the context of the question. Additionally, the repetition of "someone's face" as one of the options may be a clue that it is the correct answer.
When someone hurts someone else, they may feel guilty or regretful for their actions. This feeling is commonly known as remorse. The other options, such as resentment, anger, and sadness, may also be felt in this situation, but remorse is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of responsibility for the harm done. The option "bad karma" is not a feeling but a belief or consequence commonly associated with Eastern religions and philosophies.
The sentence implies that people moved away from Detroit to a location that is not in the city, but still relatively close. The options "forest", "wilderness", and "countryside" do not fit this description as they are more rural and located further away from urban areas. "On vacation" is also unlikely as people usually do not permanently move to vacation spots. "Suburbs" is the most likely answer as it is a common destination for people who want to move away from the city but remain close enough to commute.
The sentence indicates that Jeff Fortenberry is a Republican representative from a state whose capital is Lincoln. This narrows down the options to states that have Lincoln as their capital, which include Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. However, the sentence also specifies that Jeff Fortenberry is a Republican representative, which eliminates both Demopublican options. Therefore, the correct answer is Nebraska.
The question asks about a likely source of satisfaction when using an auto shop. Meeting expectations is a common source of satisfaction for customers in any industry, as it implies that the service or product provided met or exceeded their expectations. Having enough food, receiving compliments, and achieving goals are not related to auto shop services, while being knowledgeable may be important but does not necessarily guarantee satisfaction.
Clouds are formed in the atmosphere and are usually seen at a higher elevation than ground level or the top of a building. They can be observed from the ground, but they are generally associated with the sky. Mountains may have clouds at the summit, but not necessarily all the time, and the same goes for the air which may have clouds depending on humidity and other factors.
The sentence suggests that Sam is not willing to move from his current position despite Bess telling him to do so. "Staying put" is a commonly used idiom that means to remain in one place or position. The other options do not accurately describe Sam's actions in the sentence.
Rocks can be found on the ground, as they are typically part of the Earth's surface. While rocks can also be found in mountains and mountain ranges, these are more specific locations and may not always have rocks readily available. Farms and countryside may have rocks present, but they are not a defining characteristic of these areas.
Glass is a fragile material that can easily break or shatter if mishandled, which is why it is important to handle it with care. The other options do not explain why we should handle glass with care. Many different colors, cut vegetables, melt, and hold water all have no bearing on the fragility of glass.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to a basic need or desire that all humans share in their own home. While wealth and working hard may be desirable for some, they are not universal experiences that all humans want to have in their home. Similarly, laying eggs and falling in love are experiences that are specific to certain groups or categories of individuals, and are not applicable to all humans. On the other hand, feeling comfortable is a desire that is common to all individuals, and is particularly relevant to the context of home, which is typically viewed as a safe and comfortable space.
The mention of a redwood tree suggests that the location is in a region known for having these trees. Redwoods are primarily found in Northern California, so this is the correct answer. The other options, while some are located in the western United States, do not have a known association with redwood trees.
Peanut butter is typically stored in jars, which are designed to keep the product fresh and prevent it from drying out. The other options listed are not likely to be associated with peanut butter specifically - a cupboard could contain many different types of food or kitchen supplies, a supermarket is a place where peanut butter can be bought but not necessarily taken out of, a container could refer to any type of storage vessel which may or may not be appropriate for peanut butter, and a pantry is a larger storage space where a variety of food items may be kept.
The sentence suggests that Sally was relieved upon discovering the truth. This is because the phrase "after so much worry" implies that she was anxious or stressed about something, and discovering the truth likely gave her a sense of relief or peace of mind. The other options may also be positive emotions, but they do not have the same connection to the context of the sentence.
The Shenandoah Valley is a well-known region in West Virginia, and is even sometimes called the "Western Valley" to distinguish it from the Shenandoah Valley located in Virginia. While the other options in the choices may involve mountains or regions, they do not specifically refer to the Shenandoah Valley. Montana is a state known for its mountains, but the question is specifically asking about a valley. "Continent" and "Earth" are not relevant options as they are not states or locations within states.
The question is asking about how politicians compete for a "big event," which is likely a reference to a major election. Running for president is a common way for politicians to compete in a national election, which would fit with the context of the question. The other options do not have a clear connection to competing in an election, and may even have negative connotations (e.g. making false promises, talking nonsense).
The sentence asks for the best way to learn new things from someone else, which implies that the answer needs to be an interactive approach. Going to school, being tutored, or studying could all be valid ways of learning new things, but they do not necessarily involve interaction with another person. "Fun" is also not a relevant answer, as it doesn't explain how to learn from someone else. Asking questions, however, is a way to actively engage with someone and gain knowledge from their expertise.
"Continuing the species" is a clear reference to reproduction. Procreation is the only option that directly relates to this process. The other options are not related to reproduction and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The context of the question suggests that the answer involves a tool or device that helps with movement from one place to another. Out of the choices given, only rollerblades are associated with personal transport and motion. While a helicopter can transport people and things from one place to another, it is not a tool that helps with personal movement. A lawn mower helps with cutting grass, scissors and a knife are cutting tools that do not aid in movement.
The fact that John's map had a lot of water on it and that it covered more than half of the map suggests that the map could be of a large body of water like an ocean. The other options such as car, puddle, sink, and surface of Earth do not make sense in context with the information given.
The sentence suggests that a bald eagle likes to have a clear view of its surroundings, which indicates that it would prefer to be perched at a high vantage point. The other options do not suggest a connection to the behavior or habitat of bald eagles.
The sentence implies that dirt can get under a specific body part, which suggests that it is a small and narrow area. Fingernails are known to accumulate dirt easily, especially if someone has been working in the garden or handling soil. The other options are not body parts and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Out of the given choices, a supermarket is the most likely place to find a variety of chocolate options for purchase. While restaurants and hotels may offer chocolate desserts or gifts, they are not primarily known for selling chocolate. "Mouth" doesn't make sense in this context, and while a box could contain chocolate, it is not a place where one could buy it. Therefore, the correct answer is supermarket, which is a common location for purchasing groceries and food items.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to the storage of mouthwash, and typically, mouthwash is stored in a bottle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the first option is irrelevant to the question.
The sentence implies that the person is eligible for a car loan with a favorable interest rate. This suggests that the person has a good credit score, which indicates a history of responsible debt management and timely payments. Smooth skin and fresh produce have no relevance to the context of the sentence, while understanding oneself and having a headache are unrelated to financial matters.
Apartment buildings are typically associated with densely populated urban areas, where there is a high demand for housing and limited space. Suburbs and rural areas are often characterized by single-family homes and larger plots of land, while Indiana is a state and not a specific type of region. Housing unit is a broad term that could refer to any type of dwelling, including apartments, houses, and condos. Urban environment is a somewhat redundant phrase that does not provide any additional information.
Apple trees are often grown in rows in agricultural settings like orchards, which are commonly found in valleys or other areas with fertile soil and suitable climate conditions for growing apples. New York and Washington state are both known for their apple production, but they do not provide any context as to where apple trees might be found in a row. A park or field might have some trees, but it is unlikely that they would be arranged in a row.
The sentence suggests that there is a certain characteristic that buildings in downtown New York do not possess. The option "underground" seems to be the best choice since it is the opposite of "building" and would make sense in the context of downtown New York, where most buildings are above ground. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as buildings in downtown New York are generally known for being tall and huge, not small and solid.
The word "weekly household essentials" suggests that the purchase was made at a grocery store, which is where most people buy groceries and other household necessities. The other options, such as a child's hand, clown, or sky, do not make sense in the context of purchasing household essentials. While a balloon may be associated with a birthday party, the sentence does not suggest that this was the case here.
The question is asking about what children like to do when they are not playing outside. Playing video games is a popular indoor activity for many children and is often a preferred form of entertainment over other options like rushing around or eating. Teaching parents and reaching over do not make sense in the context of the question and are not common activities that children engage in.
Jellyfish are typically found in bodies of water, such as oceans, rivers, and ponds. The other options, such as store and office, do not make sense in the context of where jellyfish can be found in nature. Cuba may have bodies of water where jellyfish can be found, but the other options are a better fit based on general knowledge. Photographs may feature jellyfish, but they are not a location where jellyfish can actually be found.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about where a child's work would be displayed on a wall. The most likely place for a child's work to be displayed is in a classroom, where young students create artwork and hang it up for others to see. The other options, such as labyrinth or China, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Art shows may be a possible option, but the context of the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer.
The sentence references the "mysterious triangle," which is a commonly known reference to the Bermuda Triangle. The fact that the lizard had not disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding the area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Beavers are semi-aquatic animals that typically live in bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and millponds where they build their dams and lodges. Therefore, the options "lake or river" and "millpond" are likely places where a beaver would be found. The "helm of ship" option may be included since beavers are not typically found in marine environments. The "ontario" option may also be included since beavers are native to North America, including Ontario. However, "strip club" is an absurd and unrelated option that would be unlikely to be chosen.
The sentence suggests that the fire poses a danger to someone. "Harm" is the only option that directly relates to danger or injury, while the other options ("warm up," "charming," "warm hands") do not have a negative connotation. "Murder" is also not a likely outcome of a fire being out of control, as it suggests intent to kill.
A catwalk is a narrow walkway used for accessing equipment or areas above the stage in a theater. The theater is the only option that is related to performance or entertainment, which is where catwalks are commonly found. The other options, such as a fieldhouse or stadium, are unlikely to have catwalks and are typically noisy environments. A construction site may have a catwalk, but it is not typically a quiet environment.
The sentence implies that the digital artist likes to modify a famous picture to make it different or distinct from the original. The word "unique" expresses this idea best. "Creation" and "new" are too broad and do not suggest the act of modification. "Soft copy" and "paste" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The term "colonial kingdoms" suggests that the question is referring to the historical period of European colonization. Europe was the main continent from which colonial powers originated and launched their expeditions around the world. Saudi Arabia and the United States were not major world powers during the era of European colonization, and "book" and "monarchy" are not viable answers as they are not geographical locations.
The sentence suggests that the woman is experiencing memory problems, and the specific sign being mentioned is related to short-term memory. The term "forgetfulness" directly relates to the context of the sentence, as it describes the inability to remember or recall information. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence clearly indicates that the mother is punishing her children, and raising her voice suggests that she is expressing anger or frustration at them. In this context, "yell at" is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Court system" and "authoritarian" do not fit the context because there is no mention of legal proceedings or extreme control. "Ignore" and "avoid" are also unlikely because the mother is actively punishing her children.
The context of the sentence is related to war, which often involves conflict and violence. "Make friend" and "change society" do not align with the context, as they do not involve direct action towards another person in a war. "Conquer opponent" is related to the idea of defeating or winning against someone in a war, but it does not necessarily involve direct physical conflict. "Kill" is a harsh reality of war and aligns with the context of having to harm another person in a violent situation. Therefore, "fight enemy" is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that the bird is still in the process of developing and needs to accomplish a certain task to advance. Learning to fly is a crucial milestone for birds as it allows them to leave the nest and explore their surroundings. While spreading its wings and squawking may be some of the activities the bird engages in, they are not specifically mentioned as necessary for the bird to move on. Catching food is also important but not necessarily related to the bird's developmental milestone of learning to fly.
Cannons are traditionally associated with fortifications or other strongholds on land, where they were used for defensive purposes. While cannons may also be associated with battles or war museums, these options are less specific to a particular location on land. Pirate ships might also have cannons, but they would be primarily used for attacking other ships rather than for fortifications. Paying debts does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a place where a human can be lifted and carried off, which is a description of an airport where planes take off and land. The other options do not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that kids have the ability to take anything and use it in a way that relates to playing games. This implies that kids have a creative imagination and are capable of using their surroundings to engage in imaginative play. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not reflect the idea of using anything to play games.
The description of a happy person drinking a lemonade suggests that they are likely at a social or recreational event, such as a fairgrounds, concert, or carnival. However, the fact that they are also feeling nauseous or dizzy indicates that they may have consumed something that has made them ill. Given that carnivals often have a variety of food and drink options, it is possible that the person may have consumed something that has caused their symptoms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Jane didn't care about socializing with others, but still went dancing. This suggests that she went to dance for her own enjoyment and pleasure, rather than to meet people or impress them. The option "having fun" is in line with this interpretation, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question asks where to buy a game, and the choices given all suggest different types of places. A casino is known for gambling games, a playground is for outdoor play equipment, an arcade typically has video games, and a family room is a private space in a home. Therefore, the correct answer must be a place where games are sold. A toy store is a place where a variety of games are sold, including board games, card games, and puzzles, making it the most likely correct answer.
The sentence implies that achieving an advantage in something is not easy, and requires effort. The other options might be helpful in some contexts, but determination is the most generally applicable choice since effort and perseverance are commonly associated with achieving an advantage in something. Timing, skill, and having an upper hand can all be important factors as well, but without determination, success is unlikely.
The sentence indicates that the man has a lot to do but is still choosing to watch television instead. This suggests that his problem is related to motivation, rather than physical strain or boredom. The choice of "laziness" aligns with this idea, as it implies that the man lacks the drive to complete his tasks and is instead opting for an easier, more passive activity. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the implied tone of the statement.
The sentence suggests that bringing a lawsuit against a family member will have some negative consequence with the rest of the family. The choice "peace" is unlikely because lawsuits usually create conflict, not resolution. "Aggravation" and "randomness" are not specific enough and do not fit well with the context of the sentence. "Verdict" refers to a legal decision, but it is not relevant to the question since the sentence is talking about the emotional impact of a lawsuit in a family. "Tensions" is the best answer because it accurately reflects the likely outcome of a lawsuit between family members.
The question is referring to a specific religious group in the Old Testament (Judaism) and their place of worship (the temple). The Jewish community is known for their beliefs and practices in the Old Testament, and the temple in Jerusalem is a central location for their worship. The other options either do not pertain to the specific religious group being referenced or are too general to be the correct answer.
The sentence mentions a goalie, which is a position in soccer. It also mentions blocking a ball, which is a common action in soccer. The mention of blood on his face suggests that the ball was kicked with force, which is also common in soccer. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Ferrets are known for being active and curious animals, and they thrive in a setting that provides them with plenty of space to explore and play. While a classroom or a specific location like North Carolina or Great Britain may offer some opportunities for a ferret to explore, the most expansive and natural environment for a ferret to feel free would be the great outdoors. Therefore, the correct answer is outdoors.
The sentence implies that the person was unable to turn on the television because they could not find the remote. The phrase "manually" suggests that there may be another way to turn on the television, which would be a physical switch or button. The option "plug in" does not make sense in this context because the sentence does not mention anything about needing to connect the TV to an electrical outlet. The other options, "kill", "open eyes", and "watch TV" do not fit the context of the situation.
The sentence suggests that the table was specifically designed for gambling, which implies that it should be placed in a location where gambling activities might take place. A card room is a common location for playing cards and other games involving gambling, so it is the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to gambling or gaming activities.
The question implies that the person did not perceive the sharp object falling, which suggests that they have a visual impairment or inability to see. "Blind" is the only option that directly relates to this context, while the other choices focus on different types of characteristics or behaviors that do not necessarily relate to vision.
The sentence suggests that Sally's father took her to a place where they could pick out a stuffed animal, which is most commonly found in toy stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question implies that the focus is on actions that are taken to improve oneself. The phrase "better himself" directly reflects this idea and suggests that the person is taking intentional steps to make progress in some area of their life. While the other options may be important for personal growth (e.g. sleep and keeping an open mind), they do not necessarily involve actively working on self-improvement. "Think and reason" and "think critically" may be part of the process of self-improvement, but they are not specific enough to be the correct answer in this context.
The scenario suggests that the problem is not with the act of going to bed, but with staying asleep once in bed. The sentence also indicates that the person is tossing and turning, which implies that they are physically uncomfortable. Therefore, the person may need to adjust their position, change their pillow, or add extra blankets to get comfortable and improve their chances of falling asleep. The other options do not address the issue of physical discomfort, which is the likely cause of the person's sleeping troubles.
The sentence suggests that the person's mind is not focused on their current physical location, which means that they are physically present but mentally elsewhere. Therefore, the correct answer should be "present." The other options do not accurately reflect the definition of the sentence. "There" and "being here" suggest that the person's mind is present, which is not the case. "At home" and "home team" have no relevance to the context of the sentence.
The word "not everyone agrees with" suggests that the art in question may be controversial or divisive. Creating controversial art can lead to disagreement or even outright conflict between those who support and those who critique it. This can result in public discourse, media coverage, and even legal action, depending on the severity of controversy. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential consequences of creating art that is not universally appreciated.
Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water in order to create a habitat for themselves. The options "Canada" and "Montana" may be misleading because they are locations where beavers are commonly found, but it does not necessarily mean that they build dams there. "Kentucky" and "desert" are not suitable habitats for beavers as they require access to water to build their dams. Therefore, the correct answer is "river or stream."
The word "hazards" implies that there are risks or dangers associated with traveling. "Queasiness" and "diarrhea" may also be unpleasant side effects of traveling, but they are specific health issues and not hazards. "Exhilarating" and "going somewhere" are not negative or dangerous consequences associated with traveling. However, "motion sickness" is a common hazard that some people experience when traveling, especially in cars, boats, or planes.
The context of the question implies that the subject is seeking something related to their desire to attend college. "Further education" is the only option that is directly related to this context, as attending college typically involves pursuing higher education. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the answer.
The sentence suggests that the two sides are in conflict and have an intense negative feeling towards each other. Hostility is a common term used to describe this type of negative feeling. The other options (turmoil, fights, fighting, love and understanding) do not accurately capture the tone and context of the sentence. Turmoil & fights are too broad, love and understanding are the opposite of what is being described while fighting is a verb, not a noun.
The question asks what is healthy to eat the skin of. Fruits are often recommended to be eaten with the skin on as it contains important nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. However, not all fruits' skin is safe for consumption, and some may need to be peeled before eating. The other options are not related to the context of the question.
Hand shaking is a common gesture used when meeting someone for the first time in many cultures. It is a sign of respect and a way to show good intentions. The other options do not involve physical interaction and are not typical gestures used when meeting new people.
The sentence suggests that John needs to practice writing, so his teacher recommends that he start with something small and manageable like writing notes. Writing notes can help him work on his writing skills without the pressure of creating a larger piece of writing like a novel or poem. The other options are either too advanced for someone who is a terrible writer, or not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question implies that the person is looking for a portable option to carry a pencil. The other options, such as a cup, desk drawer, desktop, or university, do not make sense as methods for carrying a pencil on one's person. A pocket, on the other hand, is a common and convenient option for carrying small items like pens and pencils.
The sentence implies that John had his appointment book with him when he got a medical checkup, so it is logical to assume that he would have kept it on his person, such as in his pocket, rather than leaving it somewhere else like a handbag or wallet. Additionally, the other options, such as an office supply store or doctor's office, are unlikely places for John to search for his lost appointment book.
The sentence suggests that the act of seeing someone open a gift after buying Christmas presents causes a specific emotion for the gift giver. The word "pleasure" implies that the gift giver feels happy and satisfied to see the recipient enjoying the gift they carefully chose. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as "stress" and "debt" are negative emotions associated with gift-giving, while "understand themselves" is unrelated to the act of giving a gift. "Sense of joy" is similar, but may not necessarily be connected to gift-giving specifically.
The phrase "no cost" indicates that the thing being received does not require payment. The option "for free" is a commonly used phrase to describe something received without cost. The other options - retail markup, revenue, income, and benefit - imply some sort of exchange of money or value, which is not indicated in the question.
The sentence suggests that the trainer saw something positive in their client despite their disability. The word "disregarded" implies that the trainer did not focus on the disability and instead saw something else. The word "potential" suggests that the trainer may have seen the client's abilities and what they could achieve in the future with proper training. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the specific term used when you make changes to a contract. "Revised" is the correct answer because it refers to a modified version of an original document. "Signed" means to put your signature on a document, "folded" means to bend or crease a document, "written on paper" is too general and not specific to the context of a contract, and "rejected" means the contract was not accepted, but does not refer to changing the contract itself.
The question is asking for a device or medium used for playing music. Out of the given choices, cassettes are the only one that can be physically played on a cassette player or recorder. Opera, movie, and theatre are types of performances, while elevators do have music playing but do not require the user to bring anything to play music.
The sentence suggests that one friend has developed a habit of lying, which has negatively impacted their relationship with the other friend. The phrase "betrayal of trust" implies that the other friend no longer feels they can rely on the liar, and this has damaged the foundation of their friendship. The other options do not accurately describe the situation described in the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Sally has an interest in hair, but not in cutting it. The phrase "rub some every single day" implies that she is looking for a product that she can apply to hair. The option "oils" makes sense as a choice because there are many types of hair oils that can be used for various purposes, such as moisturizing or styling. The other options do not make as much sense within the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker needs more knowledge, which is commonly acquired through education. The word "truancy" implies that the speaker has a history of skipping or missing school, which means they need to go to more classes in order to improve their knowledge. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
To find a dental office, the most important thing to look for is a dentist who provides dental services. The other options listed might be helpful information to have when searching for a specific dental office, but they are not the essential factor in finding a dental office. The street or city would give you the location of the office, the office building might be where the office is located, and the town might indicate the general area where the office is located, but the presence of a dentist who offers dental services is the critical piece of information needed to find a dental office.
The sentence implies that the hiring agent had immediate access to a contract and pen during the interview, which suggests that they were already prepared beforehand. The most likely place for someone in that situation to keep such supplies would be in a desk drawer near their workspace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for what people want to feel more than anything, so the answer should be something universally desired. Feeling appreciated or laughing out loud are positive emotions, but they may not be the most important to everyone. Hurrying home and thanking god are specific actions or expressions of gratitude, but they don't address the emotional aspect of the question. Feeling loved, on the other hand, is something that most people crave and value deeply, regardless of cultural or personal differences.
The sentence suggests that the cat is wandering outside, which means it is likely to be found in a residential or outdoor area rather than inside a house. The other choices are related to indoor locations and comfort, which do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Dogs are known for their loyalty to their owners, making them popular as pets. While dogs can also be smart and friendly, these traits are not generally used to describe dogs as a whole. "Found outside" and "furry" are not traits that describe a dog's behavior towards people at all.
The sentence clearly states that all energy on earth comes from the sun, which suggests that the correct answer should be related to some form of energy that the sun produces. Two choices, "light" and "heat," are directly related to the energy produced by the sun, as sunlight consists of both light and heat. "Lightning" is not related to the sun, as it is a form of electric discharge in the atmosphere. "Life on earth" and "sun tan" are not related to energy production.
The context of the sentence indicates that the homeowner wanted new flooring installed in their home, which makes "house" the appropriate answer. The other options do not refer to a specific location within the context of the sentence. "Home Depot" is a store where one might purchase flooring, but it is not a specific location in the home. "Bundle" does not refer to a location at all, while "mansion" and "loft" are types of homes but do not specify where in the home the flooring is to be installed.
A parking lot is a designated area for leaving cars in public, while the other options are not necessarily appropriate for leaving a car unattended. A race track, for example, is a place for racing cars and not for parking, while the market place is typically busy and crowded, making it difficult to find a safe and secure parking spot. Similarly, a repair shop is not designed for public parking, and the city is too broad of a location to offer any specific parking guidance.
The sentence suggests that the answer pertains to a unique ability that only humans have. While other animals can hear sounds, drive cars (as they cannot operate them), reproduce, and excrete, only humans possess the ability to make mistakes. Making mistakes is a characteristic of human behavior and is often associated with learning and growth. The other options are not exclusive to humans as other animals and living organisms can perform these actions.
The use of a turn signal suggests that the car was likely parked on the side of the road. The only option related to a side of the road is the sidewalk, which is where cars may park temporarily with their turn signal on. The other choices do not have a clear relationship with the context of the sentence.
The question implies that if you don't have an umbrella, rain can have a negative impact on you. The choice "wet clothes" is the most likely answer since rain can saturate your clothing when you're without protection. The other options, such as "tickle" and "water garden," don't make sense given the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the reason for leaving the restaurant was related to the behavior of the person at the front, and specifically their lack of politeness. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated (drinking wine), or do not correspond to a negative behavior that would cause someone to leave a restaurant (making reservations, prepared to pay). Spit on me is an extreme negative behavior.
The sentence suggests that the area being described does not have a lot of resources. The word "sparse" means "thinly dispersed or scattered" and is often used when describing something that is not abundant. The other options do not convey the same meaning and do not fit the context of the sentence.
A civil action typically involves taking legal action against someone or something (such as a company or organization) in a court of law. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to involve legal procedures or processes. "Disobedience" and "anger" do not make sense in the context of taking legal action, while "complications" does not provide a specific action to take. "Trial" is a possibility, but it is more specific and refers to the formal process of presenting evidence and arguments in a court of law, whereas "court case" is a broader term that encompasses all legal proceedings related to a civil dispute.
The question is asking about the primary duty of a chef, which is the most important task they are responsible for. Chefs are primarily responsible for preparing food, which involves a wide range of tasks such as selecting ingredients, chopping and slicing vegetables and meats, cooking food to specific temperatures, and presenting dishes in an appealing way. While studying French cooking and creating thin sauces may be part of a chef's training, these tasks are not their primary duty. "Manual" is too vague and doesn't give any context, and "cook dinner" is too specific and doesn't cover all the tasks a chef may be responsible for.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to eat more simply, which often means avoiding processed foods that contain a lot of additives and preservatives. On the other hand, ripe and yellow are just descriptors of the color of foods and don't really connect to the idea of eating more simply. Greenweed is not a commonly known food, and cloy means overly sweet or rich, which also doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
Personal apple trees are typically planted in private, residential areas such as backyards. This is because they require regular care and attention, and are often used for personal consumption rather than commercial purposes. The other answer choices do not align with the context of a personal apple tree, as they are either too general (Wisconsin, countryside, fields) or too public (front yard).
"Cashing in your chips" is a phrase commonly used in casinos to indicate exchanging your chips (currency used in casinos) for cash. Therefore, the question is asking what you would do after receiving your cash winnings. The most appropriate answer is "leave" since it implies that you will be exiting the casino after successfully cashing in your chips. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The word "unpleasant" is missing from the question, making it a bit tricky. To answer the question, we need to consider which word describes something that is unlikely to be bad or unpleasant. "Exceptional" could go either way - it could be positive or negative depending on the context. "Advantageous" and "sufficient" can also be good or bad depending on the situation. "Strength" could be bad if it leads to arrogance or negative behavior. "Virtuous," on the other hand, is almost always considered a positive trait, and unlikely to be seen as something bad.
Hiking is a popular activity for people who enjoy being outdoors and surrounded by nature. It offers a chance to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life and immerse oneself in the beauty and tranquility of natural surroundings. While staying hydrated by drinking water is important during a hike, it is not the main reason people go hiking. Getting lost and getting tired are risks associated with hiking, but they are not typically the goals of the activity. Hunger may be a consideration, but it is not the reason people choose to go hiking.
The sentence indicates that Sam put his "return ticket" in a special box. This suggests that he had other tickets that he also kept in the box, which makes "tickets" a likely option. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as well. An "airline envelope" could be a possibility, but it is not clear why Sam would keep all of his possessions in it, and the sentence does not mention any other items stored in the special box. "Airport" and "plane" do not make sense because Sam would not keep all of his possessions in these locations. "Keepsakes" is possible, but there is no clear indication that the special box was reserved for mementos or sentimental items.
The sentence suggests that the object being held by the handle is something that can be used for a public performance or display, since many people are watching. The phrase "grasping things" is too general and could apply to many different objects. Holding a door by the handle wouldn't involve any kind of performance or display. A watering can or coffeepot might be held by the handle, but they're not typically objects that would be used for public display or performance. A baseball bat, on the other hand, is often used in a public game or performance, and would be held by the handle during use.
The sentence mentions that Jill is in a shopping complex in Ann Arbor, which is a city in the state of Michigan. The other options do not have any relevance to the sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. Choosing the correct answer requires basic knowledge of geography and an understanding of the context of the sentence.
Birth control pills are typically taken at home, which suggests that the correct answer is likely to be a location where one might keep their medication at home. The other options include retail locations where one might purchase birth control pills, or spaces where a person might carry their medication with them, but these choices are less likely to be the correct answer based on the context given. The bedroom is a logical choice for where a person might take their birth control pill, as it is typically a private and comfortable space where one might feel most at ease when taking medication.
The sentence explicitly states that the person prefers to shop locally, which implies that they prioritize supporting local businesses and products. The opposite of local would be foreign, as products from other countries are not considered part of the local economy. The other options are not necessarily opposite to the concept of shopping local and do not fit the context of the sentence.
Exercise can often lead to feelings of tiredness and soreness, but exhaustion is a more extreme form of fatigue that can occur after prolonged physical activity. Three hours is a significant amount of time to exercise without a break, which increases the likelihood of experiencing exhaustion. Muscle growth and soreness are also possible outcomes of exercise, but they do not necessarily indicate the severity of the girl's condition. Pain may also be a symptom of overexertion, but it is not as specific to the context of the given sentence.
The sentence gives clues about what Jim was interested in and what he wasn't interested in. It states that he didn't like physical labor or dealing with people, which suggests that he may have been looking for a less hands-on, more individual pursuit. The phrase "make a fortune" implies that he was interested in investments or financial gain. The option "stock market" fits both of these criteria and is the most likely answer. The other options - cookie, real estate, treasure chest, and treasure hunting - are not typically associated with making a fortune through investments or financial gain.
The question suggests that the person being asked is a man and therefore would likely use pockets to store their change. Purses are typically associated with women, and jars and wallets are not convenient options for storing loose change if you plan to use it soon. The backseat of a car is also not a practical option for storing change that you plan to use on the go.
The sentence suggests that remembering something involves referencing something that you already have. This is commonly referred to as prior knowledge, or information that you have already learned and stored in your memory. The other options, such as memory cells and brain cells, are not accurate descriptions of the process of remembering. Nerve cells may be involved in the transmission of information, but they do not necessarily represent the information itself.
The sentence indicates that the ball is highly elastic, which means that it is able to quickly spring back to its original shape after being compressed or stretched. This property is commonly associated with bouncing, which involves a rapid upward movement after hitting a surface. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of an elastic ball.
The sentence suggests that a person lost their balance while roller skating and couldn't recover, which commonly results in falling down. The other options are not logical outcomes of losing balance while roller skating. Option "injury" could be a result of falling down, but it doesn't necessarily happen every time. Option "hit people" doesn't relate to the context at all while option "move fast" is irrelevant.
The sentence implies that the person has a vivid imagination that affects their sleep, suggesting they have adventurous and intense dreams. Nightmares and death are possibilities, but the sentence uses the word "wild" to describe the characteristic, which better fits with dreams. The option "when I have a nightmare" is a sentence fragment and not a valid choice. Erections are not related to the context of the sentence.
Lemurs are wild animals and are typically kept in captivity in zoos or animal parks. They are usually kept in large cages or enclosures that mimic their natural habitat as closely as possible. The other options, such as a bank or a hole, have no connection to the context of the question and are unlikely places for a lemur to be kept.
The sentence suggests that James is considering where to install a spa, and the most appropriate location would be in a space that provides privacy and accessibility. A backyard is commonly associated with providing privacy and convenience, which would make it the most likely choice for a spa installation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or imply a lack of privacy.
The sentence suggests that the farmer has a goal related to agriculture. The phrase "raise crops" specifically implies that the farmer's main objective is to grow plants for food or other purposes. The other options, such as "farm land" and "beer cans," do not seem like plausible goals for a farmer, and "can produce" and "seed plants" are too vague to be the main goal.
The sentence suggests that the speaker's friends prefer girls who are "thick," which likely refers to a curvy or voluptuous body type. In contrast, the speaker prefers girls who are "healthy but slender," indicating that they prefer a thinner, more toned body type. The word "slender" specifically denotes a thin and graceful build without any excess fat or bulk, which aligns with the speaker's preference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that when people are in a state of trance and need to calm themselves, they engage in a specific action. Out of the given choices, meditating is the most appropriate answer as it involves focusing on one's breath and inner thoughts in order to reduce stress and promote relaxation. The other options - running, confusion, epilepsy, and hallucination - do not align with the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect.
The question is asking specifically about how a person can destroy a car after becoming inebriated, and one of the most common ways that this happens is through drunk driving. Drunk driving involves operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, which impairs a person's ability to react quickly, make good decisions, and perform complex tasks like driving. Being high on drugs or simply being in a state of drunkenness may not necessarily lead to destruction of a car, while talking nonsense is not directly related to destroying a car. Automobile accidents may be a result of drunk driving, but not necessarily the only way to destroy a car while inebriated.
Being drunk typically leads to a state of intoxication, which is marked by impaired judgment, difficulty in moving or speaking, and altered perceptions of reality. While some individuals may experience other physical or emotional changes as a result of drinking, such as having an erection or feeling sick, intoxication is the most likely and immediate outcome of consuming too much alcohol. Death is also a possibility but is less common as a direct result of drinking, and hangovers are a delayed effect that occurs after intoxication has subsided.
The sentence suggests that Mable has a fondness for horses, which is unlikely to be expressed through activities like cleaning or dominating them. Eating grass is something that horses do, not people. Kept in barn stalls is a description of where the horses are housed, not an activity that Mable would engage in. This leaves playing with the horses as the most logical option, since it's a common way for people to interact with animals they enjoy being around.
x is a brand of tissue paper that is commonly used for wiping one's nose or face. The sentence suggests that the person is carrying a tissue paper in their pants, which is likely to be kept in a pocket as it is the most convenient and accessible place to store small items. The other options such as a box, purse, or bag are not typically associated with keeping a single tissue paper. "Blow nose" is an action that one may do with a Kleenex, but it is not a location.
The question suggests that the person wants to emulate Michael Phelps, who is a highly successful swimmer. Learning to swim would be the first step towards achieving this goal. Crossing the street, feeling relieved, or acting responsibly are not relevant actions in this scenario. Avoiding swimming would also contradict the person's desire to be like Michael Phelps.
A press conference is a common event for a president to meet others, such as reporters or other political leaders. It is a forum for the president to share information and answer questions, making it a likely place for interaction with others. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they are not related to meeting others in a professional or political setting.
The sentence implies that marmots have a unique ability to maneuver in high places thanks to their hands, which suggests that they are adapted to living in rocky areas. The option "rocky hillside" makes the most sense because it specifically references the type of terrain that marmots are likely to inhabit. The other options - outside, hill, jungle, and tree - do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide any indication of what marmots might climb using their hands.
The sentence suggests a situation where there is unrequited love, meaning one person loves the other but the feeling is not mutual. This can cause heartache, which is a feeling of emotional pain and sadness. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response to unrequited love.
A pail, nails, and a hammer are all tools commonly used for home improvement or DIY projects. The context suggests that the person is looking to purchase these items, and the most likely place to find them all together would be a hardware store. The other options do not typically carry a wide range of tools and hardware.
The sentence suggests that lizards use a specific method for achieving locomotion, and the most common method among lizards is through the use of four legs. This is a general characteristic of reptiles, which typically have four limbs for walking and crawling. The other options do not describe a method of locomotion. Bones, backbone, and tail are all parts of the lizard's body, but they don't necessarily relate to how the lizard moves. Changing the color of the skin is a form of camouflage and does not necessarily have anything to do with locomotion.
The options are all physical locations, but the Milky Way Galaxy, being a massive collection of stars and celestial bodies, is not a place where a terrestrial animal like a cat could exist. The other options are all places where a cat could potentially be found, with varying degrees of likelihood.
The sentence suggests that there is a court in the center of the seating area, which is a characteristic commonly associated with sports stadiums. Seats in rows surrounding a court would be typical for a game like soccer, basketball, or tennis, which all have a court or field in the center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions that the student is failing, which implies that they are not passing the course. Therefore, the goal should be to pass the course by improving their grades. The other options may be helpful study strategies, but they do not address the main issue of the student failing the course.
Marmosets are small primates that live in trees and do not typically burrow or live underground. Therefore, it is logical that they would be unable to breathe in a burrow or underground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Bodybuilders typically eat large amounts of food in order to gain weight and muscle mass. They need to consume a surplus of calories to support their intensive workouts and promote muscle growth. The other options, such as "pleasant conversation" and "sounds of digestion", do not make sense in the context of why a bodybuilder would eat so much. "Store food for winter" is not relevant to a human body and "satisfy hunger" suggests a normal level of eating, not excessive consumption associated with bodybuilders.
The sentence indicates that the clothes are already clean, which rules out the options "soap" and "launder." The word "fold" suggests that the clothes are being put away, which makes sense in the context of taking them out of the dryer. "Take off" does not make sense in this context, and "sort" may be necessary before washing the clothes, but not after they have already been cleaned.
Reproduction is the primary biological function of sexual intercourse, as it allows for the creation of offspring. Compliments, sweating, talented, and affluent have no clear connection to the biological function of sex.
The sentence suggests that while resting, a person is doing something that affects other people. Lying down, falling asleep, and time passing are all common activities while resting but do not have a direct impact on other people. Snoring, however, can affect other people's sleep or cause disturbance, making it the correct answer. "Loud" can also be a correct answer as it suggests a noisy activity that could disturb others, but it is less specific than snoring.
Shareholders own a portion of a company's stock, which represents a share of ownership in that company. This means that they have a financial interest and a stake in the company's success or failure. The other options - building, headache, financial trouble, and factory - do not accurately represent what a shareholder owns in a company.
Canada is a country that has two official languages: English and French. However, English is spoken by the majority of the population, so it is likely that most people in Canada will speak English to converse. The other options, such as speaking in tongues or watering plants, are not related to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated.
Lemurs are native to Madagascar, which is known for its diverse rainforest habitats. While Australia and India have their own unique ecosystems, they are not typically associated with lemur habitats. Similarly, while some lemurs may live in captivity in a cage, that is not the natural environment for these animals. Finally, while there are many different types of forests around the world, the reference to lemurs in the question suggests that the correct answer is likely the rainforest, which is a well-known habitat for many different types of primates.
The question is asking about the first step someone would take in returning to work one day, suggesting that the person is currently not at work (perhaps on a day off or holiday). Getting out of bed is the logical first step in preparing to go to work, as it is necessary to physically leave the bed and start the day. The other options are either not relevant to the question or come after the initial step of getting out of bed.
Many people create art for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings them. Creating art can be a pleasurable and rewarding experience, which is why pleasure would be a positive effect of creating art. While art can sometimes generate controversy or facilitate communication, these are not necessarily positive effects in and of themselves. Heart and pride are also not typically regarded as positive effects of creating art in the general sense.
Electric storms or thunderstorms are most likely to occur during the summer season when there is a higher likelihood of warm and humid air masses, which is a favorable condition for the formation of thunderstorms. The other choices do not provide any relevant information about the likelihood of electric storms.
The context of the question suggests that it is related to hosting guests in a house. When unexpected guests arrive and there is not enough seating available, it is common to bring out folding chairs to accommodate everyone. In a house, the most appropriate place to put additional chairs would be in a room where guests can gather and socialize, such as a living room or dining room. The other options listed, such as an auditorium, ocean, church, or garage, are unlikely to be relevant or appropriate in this context.
The sentence suggests that a good musician has an exceptional ability to perceive sounds beyond the normal range of hearing or attention. This is a quality commonly associated with musical talent and may be essential for a musician to create complex arrangements and harmonies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the idea of heightened sensory perception.
The sentence suggests that the cat is making a decision about entering or leaving a space that has a door, which likely refers to the front door of a house or building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
If the person does not have a shirt pocket to carry the sunglasses, the next logical choice would be to store them in a bag or purse. The other options do not make as much sense - putting them in shoes would be uncomfortable and potentially damaging to the sunglasses, storing them in a drugstore is not relevant to the question, and the glove compartment is not a portable solution if the person wants to bring the sunglasses with them.
Gift shops in museums often sell replicas of paintings as part of their merchandise. Museums typically display a large number of paintings, so it makes sense that they would offer visitors the opportunity to take home a reproduction of a favorite artwork. The other options may have gift shops, but they are less likely to sell replicas of paintings. For example, while Disney and hotels may sell souvenirs, they are not typically focused on art replicas.
The sentence suggests that taxes are an unavoidable part of life, as indicated by the phrase "taxes are inevitable." The phrase "death and taxes" is a common expression, meaning that just as death is certain, so are taxes. None of the other options are commonly associated with taxes or the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a location that is not suitable for a cemetery. A populated area would not be an appropriate location for a cemetery due to potential health and environmental concerns. Cemetery locations should be chosen carefully to ensure that they do not pose any risks to public health or the environment. The other options may be suitable for cemetery locations depending on various factors, such as the size of the area, the local laws and regulations, and the cultural practices of the community.
The sentence suggests that Wendy's toy is damaged in some way, and that she believes she can fix it. The other options do not relate to repairing or fixing something that is broken. "Raise" or "make" are not appropriate in this context because they suggest creating something new, while "reincarnate" refers to the idea of coming back to life after death, which does not apply here. "Build" also suggests creating something new, rather than fixing something that already exists.
The word "protected" suggests that the forest is under some form of conservation or government regulation. The most likely place to find a protected forest is within a designated national park, where many natural resources are preserved and protected. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to protected forests. The temperate zone refers to a specific climate region, South Africa is a country, the countryside refers to rural areas in general, and the Amazon basin is a specific geographic region.
A dictionary is specifically designed to provide the meanings of words. An encyclopedia contains more general information on a wide range of topics, and a sentence or phrase may contain the word but does not necessarily define it. Language refers to a system of communication, not a specific reference book.
The sentence suggests that the boxes of toys were put in long term storage, which is commonly found in a basement. Basements are often used for storage as they are a cool, dry place that is out of the way. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A yoyo is a commonly sold toy and can be found in stores that specialize in selling toys. A toy shop or toy store would likely have yoyos available for purchase. The other options are less likely places to find a yoyo, unless it has already been purchased and brought there.
The sentence indicates that the mother needed to put away a plate, which is a common item found in a kitchen. The options of flea market, museum, and restaurant do not make logical sense since they are not locations where someone would typically store a plate. The option of dishwasher is a possibility, but the sentence does not give any indication that the mother specifically put the plate in the dishwasher. Therefore, the most logical choice is the kitchen cupboard, where plates are commonly stored.
The sentence suggests that someone's relative committed suicide, which is often a tragic and deeply painful experience for the family and loved ones left behind. "Sorrow" is a synonym for grief or sadness, and it is a reasonable answer to the question based on the context of the sentence. "Uncomfortable," "harm to others," "being dead," and "death" are all possible emotions or outcomes that might be associated with suicide, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
The phrase "more than a drop of blood" implies a violent or physical altercation where bloodshed is expected. The other options do not suggest a scenario where blood spillage is likely, except for maybe a needle if someone is receiving a medical injection, but the phrase "more than a drop" makes that option less likely. "Battlefield" could be a contender but the question only asks for one drop, which is not indicative of a battlefield where large-scale violence occurs. "Person" and "test tube" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the saw is not needed immediately but will be needed in the future. It also states that the house has only one floor, which suggests that there is no basement. Putting the saw in a logging camp or in a vehicle does not make sense since these are not typical locations where one would store tools. The most logical choice is a tool shed, which is a common location for storing tools and equipment. The toolbox is also a possible choice, but the question specifies that the saw will not be needed soon, so it may be too small to hold a saw.
The sentence is asking for a way to share memories of visiting a museum, which suggests a method for recording the memories. Taking pictures is a common way to capture memories, especially of places like museums. The other options (crying, talking loudly, whispering, entertainment) do not relate to recording or sharing memories in a meaningful way.
The question explicitly states that the horse should be from New England, which is a region in the northeastern United States consisting of six states, including Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Of the options provided, only New Hampshire is located in New England, making it the correct answer. Kentucky and Canada are not in the New England region, while engraving is not a state and has no relevance to the question.
Listening to music is often associated with pleasure and entertainment. People may listen to music to relax, uplift their mood, or enjoy the emotional and artistic expression conveyed through the music. While music can also be used for dancing, keeping time, or learning (such as in music education), these purposes are not necessarily the primary reason someone would listen to music. Profit is also not a common reason for listening to music, as most listeners do not directly profit from listening to music.
Since the sentence mentions transporting cargo by sea, the logical choice is a ship. The term "ship's hold" refers to the area of the ship where cargo is stored during transportation. The other options, such as boat, bus, aeroplane, and airplane, are not typically used to transport large quantities of cargo across long distances, making "ship's hold" the correct answer.
The sentence indicates that the instructor was teaching the students about keeping everything tied tight, which suggests a focus on precision and control. The word "loose" is the opposite of those concepts, and therefore makes sense as something that the instructor did not want to see. The other options do not fit the context as well - "baggy" and "broad" describe clothing or shapes, "gas" is unrelated to the concept of tying things, and "slack" could be a synonym for loose but is less commonly used in this context.
The context of the sentence suggests that Marna did something wrong and confessed it to Billy. Since Billy is described as a forgiving person, it can be inferred that he responded positively to the confession. The fact that Marna felt relief indicates that she was worried about how Billy would react, but his forgiveness put her at ease. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone who is lazy would choose to watch TV because it allows them to get comfortable without putting in much effort. The other options are also reasons why someone might choose to watch TV, but they do not necessarily relate to laziness specifically. For example, someone might watch TV to be entertained or see their favorite show, but this does not necessarily mean they are lazy.
The phrase "got in the bus in Hell and got off at Christmas" suggests that the trip covered a distance or route, likely through a series of locations. The choices "big cities," "New York," "university," and "Michigan" all refer to specific places and do not fit the context of the sentence. "City" is a more general term that could refer to any urban area, making it the most appropriate choice given the information provided.
The question is asking what a lawyer can do to engage a difficult-to-find witness, which implies that the witness is present but not easily accessible. Coming early would allow the lawyer to meet with the witness and discuss their testimony, potentially building a rapport and making them more willing to participate in the case. The other options do not relate to engaging a difficult-to-find witness. "State case" implies the lawyer is presenting their case to a judge or jury, which may not involve the witness at all. "Nullified" and "clear of all charges" suggest the case has already been resolved, which would not be relevant for engaging a witness. "Produce evidence" may be a part of engaging a witness, but it does not address the issue of difficulty in finding them.
The sentence suggests that people are doing something in addition to clasping their hands while praying. Kneeling down is a common posture for prayer in many religious traditions, making it the most likely answer. Whispering and talking to God are also common when praying, but they are not actions people do in addition to clasping their hands. Bowing may be a part of some prayer traditions, but it is not always done alongside clasping the hands. Asking for help is not necessarily an action that people physically do while praying.
The opposite of ordinary is something that is not common or average. Out of the given choices, special fits this definition the best as it implies a distinctiveness or uniqueness. The other options have connotations that suggest an even greater deviation from the norm, rather than just being uncommon. Strange, weird, and unbelievable all imply an element of shock or disbelief, while exceptional suggests something outstanding or extraordinary.
The sentence suggests that John needs a tool to take off the blade of his lawnmower. A screwdriver is a common tool found in a toolkit or a tool belt, so these options would be the most likely places for John to look for his screwdriver. A handyman or a repair shop might have the tool, but it's not clear from the sentence whether John would need to go to those places or if he already has the tool. A bar would not be a typical place to find a screwdriver.
The sentence suggests that the husband is accustomed to the wife typically selecting the place for dinner, so he is not used to making the decision himself. The word "wherever" suggests that he is open to any option and does not have a preference, but is leaving the decision up to his wife. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Air is a mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth, but the amount of air is relatively thin (compared to other substances) in the atmosphere. Therefore, the option that provides the greatest amount of air is likely to be space shuttle, since outside the Earth's atmosphere, there is a vacuum and air is relatively less compressed, which would provide a larger volume of air per unit area compared to the Earth's surface, train stations, houses or parks.
The word "students" suggests that the place being referred to is a school or university. However, the fact that the auditorium is empty implies that the event being held there is not related to education or learning. Therefore, the most likely option is a funeral or memorial service, which may be held in a school or university auditorium if the deceased person had a connection to the institution. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
Zoos are commonly known as places where people go to see a variety of animals. State parks and gardens may have some animal exhibits, but they are not the primary focus of those places. Laboratories are usually used for scientific research and not for public viewing. The phrase "surface of earth" is too general and does not provide any context or specific information relevant to the question.
The sentence implies that the rainwater collected in the container is being used for a non-potable purpose, like watering plants. This makes the most sense as a garden would require regular watering, while the other options are unlikely to require regular watering or may not have plants at all.
The sentence implies that obtaining lunch at a restaurant comes at a cost, which indicates that the result of this action is monetary. The other options are not necessarily linked to the act of obtaining lunch at a restaurant.
The discovery phase of a trial is when both parties exchange information and evidence that they plan to use in the trial. During this phase, lawyers are required to produce any evidence they have that supports their case. The other options do not relate to the discovery phase of a trial - lawyers may charge a fee for their services, but this is not specific to the discovery phase; coming early is not a requirement; convicting is the goal of the trial, not a requirement of the discovery phase; and stating the case is done during the trial itself, not the discovery phase.
The sentence suggests that James struggled to begin his work, but once he did, he was able to work without stopping. This implies that he was able to build up momentum and work efficiently once he got started. Panic, stress, and anxiety are negative emotions that would likely hinder James' ability to work. Accomplishing is not a state of mind, but rather a result of successfully completing a task. Momentum is the only option that aligns with the context of the sentence and suggests a positive work mindset.
The sentence suggests that the place is not a natural habitat for a beaver to be free in, and the presence of a cage implies a form of captivity. Although beavers are commonly found in woodlands, they would still feel free in such an environment. Canada and Ontario both have large natural habitats where beavers are free to roam. A zoo is a clear example of captivity, but it is not specific to beavers and is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "cage."
The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where a telephone is usually present. The options "library" and "house" do not have any clear connection to a specific location where a telephone is found. "Under chair" could suggest a random location where a phone book may or may not be present. "At hotel" is not specific enough and could refer to various locations within a hotel. "Telephone booth" is the best option because it is a specific location where a telephone is usually present along with a phone book for reference.
The name "Gruber Excavation" does not provide any clear indication of where the company is located. However, the option "Montana" is a geographical location and could be a possible answer. Additional knowledge about the company's location, such as its website or other context in the question, would help to confirm whether Montana is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that prolonged tickling can cause dizziness and spinning, which are both common symptoms of vertigo. Vertigo can also cause nausea, making it the most likely option among the choices given. Vomiting and itchiness may also occur in some cases, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence. Laughing and giggling are not necessarily negative symptoms of tickling and are not related to the dizziness and spinning mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that graveyards are commonly found in a specific location. The context of the sentence, "People die, that's why you tend to find a graveyard," implies that graveyards are built for a specific purpose related to death. Church property is a common location for graveyards because many churches historically provided burial services to their members. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The spine is a crucial part of the human body's skeletal system and is located in the back. While the lumbar refers to the lower back region, it is not the same as the spine itself. Books may have spines, but this is not relevant to the context of the question.
Heavy traffic can be frustrating and anxiety-inducing, which suggests that the correct answer is stress. While transportation and getting somewhere are related to the act of driving, they do not describe an emotional state. Similarly, patient and relaxation are emotions that are unlikely to be associated with the experience of driving in heavy traffic.
The sentence indicates that a tennis game has started, which implies that the game is in progress or underway. Therefore, the correct answer would be "progress" or "match," as those options are related to the context of a tennis game. "Achievement" does not make sense, as it relates to success or accomplishment rather than the start of a game, and "park" and "field with tennis court" are not related to the sentence at all.
The sentence implies that the person got into an accident while drunk driving, which suggests they may have sustained some kind of physical harm or injury. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the action being described involves the care and upkeep of a specific type of plant (rosebushes) in an outdoor setting (a lawn). Landscaping is a term commonly used to refer to the design, installation, and maintenance of outdoor spaces, including gardens and lawns. Cooking, California, backyard, and courtyard do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the answer should describe a part of a property that is located next to a driveway. A yard is a common feature of many properties and may be located next to a driveway to provide a buffer between the property and the street or to create a space for outdoor activities. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The context of the question suggests that the disaster preparedness video is highlighting the importance of being aware of the materials that doors are made of in certain situations. This is likely in reference to situations such as building fires, where doors made of certain materials may be more or less likely to provide adequate protection. Restrooms, walls, apartments, and theaters are all locations where doors may be present, but they do not necessarily suggest any particular connection to disaster preparedness or the importance of door materials. However, the word "building" specifically implies a larger structure with multiple rooms and potential hazards, which would be a more likely setting for a disaster preparedness video to focus on.
The sentence implies that love is used by some people to achieve or experience something positive for themselves. "Live life" is a common phrase that suggests enjoying or experiencing all that life has to offer, which fits with the idea of using love in a positive way. The other options do not fit with the positive connotation of using love for oneself.
Chesterfield is a type of sofa that originated in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England. Therefore, the best place to find a well-crafted chesterfield would be in Derbyshire, where the style originated. The other options (museum, living room, foyer) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a personal opinion on how to make the right decision. "Trust himself" is an option that suggests one should rely on their own instincts and judgement, which is a common belief in decision-making. The other options do not directly relate to personal decision-making, such as "good looking" or "acknowledgment." "New experiences" and "questioning" may be valid approaches to decision-making, but they are not as universally accepted as trusting oneself.
The sentence implies that at the age of 19 years, most people have completed a certain milestone. Going to jail or dying suddenly is not a common occurrence for individuals at the age of 19. While belief in God is a personal choice, it is not necessarily linked to age. Crossing a river may happen to some individuals at any age, but it is not a universal experience that applies to most people at 19 years of age. Therefore, the logical answer is completing high school, as this is a developmental milestone that is typically reached by the age of 19 years.
The sentence suggests that there is a collection of small dwellings, which are typically found in an apartment complex. The parking area is also mentioned, which is common for apartment complexes to have. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that cuddling in bed after sex is a way to spend time with a loved one, which indicates a positive experience. The word "pleasant" is commonly used to describe enjoyable experiences, while "painful" suggests discomfort or suffering. "Adorable" does not seem appropriate in this context, while "dirty" has negative connotations. "Effect of insemination" does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person had a good time dancing, which is commonly associated with feelings of happiness and enjoyment. Saying "I am happy" after a good dance is a natural expression of this emotion. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence implies that the scientists were working with preserved specimens that required cold storage. This suggests that the location being referred to is likely a laboratory, where scientific research is typically conducted. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as book stores and warehouses would not typically require cold storage, while refrigerators and freezers are too general to provide a clear answer.
The sentence suggests that John doesn't have time to cook, which implies that he is looking for pre-cooked or ready-to-cook potatoes. The most likely place to find such potatoes would be a store, where they can be purchased in various forms (e.g. fresh, frozen, pre-cooked, etc.). While restaurants may also serve baked potatoes, they are less likely to sell them for individuals to take home. A pantry and root cellar are places where food is stored, but they are unlikely to sell ready-to-cook potatoes. Casserole is a dish made with potatoes, but it is not a place where one can obtain them.
The context of the sentence suggests that the location is a place where people are carrying plastic bags, which is a typical occurrence at a department store. Parks may have people carrying bags, but it is unlikely to be the main activity observed in the sentence. Houses and own homes would not typically have a large number of people going in and out of the entryway. An office building may have people carrying bags, but it is not as common as at a department store.
The sentence indicates that the subject is the president, suggesting that the location mentioned would be related to politics or government. The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, so it is the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "play" in this context suggests an activity that is enjoyable and fun. It is common for children to experience happiness and excitement when they play, which would be the logical answer. None of the other choices have an obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is looking for a place to stay, so the most likely options are hotel or motel, as these are establishments specifically designed for temporary lodging. The phone book might have listings for hotels and motels, but it also includes many other businesses, such as restaurants, shops, and service providers. In a story book or city, it's unlikely to find specific names of places to stay, as these are not typically the focus of the narrative or the main purpose of a city.
The word "bay" refers to a body of water partially enclosed by land, typically with a wider opening than a cove but narrower than a gulf. Therefore, the answer must be an area that is situated along a body of water and has a bay within its geographical boundaries. Lake, shoreline, and beach do not necessarily have bays unless they have a specific body of water that fits the definition of a bay. Manhattan is not typically associated with bays, so coastal area is the correct answer as it refers to a region near a coastline that could potentially have a bay.
The sentence suggests that the subject and his girlfriend have differing taste preferences in snacks. The adjective "sweet" is used to describe the girlfriend's preference, which implies that the subject's preference is a contrasting taste. The options "lame," "ocean," and "dry" do not have any clear connection to taste preferences, while "sour" may be a contrasting taste but is not directly related to snack foods. "Salty" is a commonly known taste preference for snack foods such as chips or pretzels, making it the most suitable answer.
The sentence mentions that light from the sun becomes weaker as it spreads out, indicating that it is referring to the vast expanse of space beyond Earth. The option "a locked room" doesn't make sense in this context as light cannot pass through a locked room. "Attic" and "desk" are both indoor spaces and have no connection to outer space. "Ocean" may be a valid option in some cases when discussing the effects of light on water, but in this sentence, the focus is on the universe beyond Earth.
Cremation is a common method of handling a deceased body, where it is burned and reduced to ashes. While there are other options, such as burial or donation for medical research, the question does not provide any indication that these other options are relevant. The other choices in the question - killed in war, opposed to war, introverted, and murdered - do not provide any information about what happens to a body after death.
Aberdeen is a city located in South Dakota, USA. It is not in Washington, Europe, Scotland or Maryland.
The question suggests that the focus is on keeping pens in use rather than replacing them altogether. The answer, therefore, needs to relate to a part of the pen that can be replaced. Ink cartridges are commonly used in pens and can be easily replaced to keep the pen in use. The other options do not relate to a part that can be replaced, such as taking notes and using color which suggest how to use the pen or caps which are more protective measures.
The phrase "a lot of people" suggests that Sonny is looking for a location with high foot traffic. A city would be the best location for this, as it has a dense population and a variety of events that attract large crowds, including concerts. The other options may have some foot traffic, but not to the same extent as a city.
The sentence suggests that there is no money left after paying bills. The word "broke" is commonly used to describe a situation where someone has no money, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "headaches" and "grief", do not make sense in this context.
A ballpoint pen is commonly used for writing checks, and the options suggest different locations where someone might be writing a check. Of these options, the most likely location for writing a check is an office desk, as this is where someone might be paying bills or filling out business-related forms. The other options are less likely to be places where someone would write a check, such as a backpack or desk drawer.
The sentence indicates that the person is at a summer home and is trying to cool down a room. An electric fan is often used to circulate air and create a cooler environment in a hot room. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as the person is not in their office, closet, field, or home in general, but specifically in a hot room.
Electric razors are commonly used in bathrooms for shaving. Water is often used to wet the face before shaving or to rinse the razor during and after use. Therefore, it's likely that an electric razor could be exposed to water in a bathroom setting. The other options do not provide a suitable location for the exposure of an electric razor to water.
The sentence suggests that the weather outside is cold and snowy, which is not conducive to outdoor activities. Therefore, people are likely to opt to stay indoors to avoid the harsh weather conditions. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to staying indoors during cold and snowy weather.
The question asks for the opposite of beautiful, which implies something that is unattractive or unpleasant to look at. While the other options may be related to negative connotations of beauty, they do not directly represent the opposite of beautiful. "Plain" and "homely" may be neutral or average in appearance, but they do not necessarily convey the opposite of beauty. "Overcast" refers to a type of weather and is not related to appearance at all, while "a witch" is a specific character and represents a cultural stereotype, which is not a clear opposite to the concept of beauty.
The question is asking about the result of cooking, which is typically food that has been prepared for consumption. The other options are either too specific (full feast, having dinner) or not related to the process of cooking (get food, pride).
The sentence suggests that there is a name for the erosion that is opposite or contrasting to the majestic flight of the bald eagle. Hells Canyon is a geologic wonder located on the border of Oregon and Idaho, known for its deep canyons and rugged terrain. The name "Hells Canyon" has a clear contrast to the beautiful eagle soaring through the sky, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James wanted to eat a hamburger for a specific purpose, which is to fulfill the need of his hunger. "Satisfy hunger" is the most logical answer as it directly answers the question of why James wanted to eat a hamburger. "Good to eat," "cook one," "taste," and "protein" are not appropriate answers since they do not address James' immediate need to assuage his hunger.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is feeling very angry and may need to calm down before continuing with a certain activity. "Cool off" implies taking a break from the situation and allowing oneself to calm down emotionally. The other options do not fit with the idea of taking a break and calming down, and some of them are even more violent, such as "fight" and "destroy enemy."
The sentence suggests that the rats are coexisting with turtles, which implies that they are being kept in a controlled environment with these animals. The options "roof," "sewers," and "cellar" do not seem like viable locations for keeping rats with turtles, while a "laboratory" is too broad and could involve a variety of other animals. Therefore, "reptile farm" is the most likely choice as it is a specific location where reptiles and small animals like rats may be kept together.
Mathematical rules are a fundamental part of mathematics, and are usually found in textbooks or other educational materials. These rules are based on mathematical principles and concepts, and are used to solve problems or perform calculations. Family situations, everything, the bible, and lawbooks do not typically contain mathematical rules, and are thus unlikely to be the correct answer.
The repeated option "clean house" seems to suggest that this is the correct answer, and it also makes sense given that maids are typically hired to perform domestic chores such as cleaning, dusting, and organizing in a private residence. The other options are either redundant or do not pertain specifically to the job description of a maid.
The sentence suggests that the garden being referred to is open to the public, which is a characteristic commonly associated with parks. Fences are used to enclose private spaces, back yards are typically associated with residential areas, and "pretty" and "ground" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that Sam was a student at Elmhurst elementary and was late when the bell rang, implying that she needed to get to her class. Therefore, the correct answer is "go to class". The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the buffalo were easy to spot because they were big and thick, but also implies that their numbers were reduced significantly by hunting. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to describe a decrease in numbers, which eliminates choices like "thickskin" which have no relation to the sentence. "Thin" and "sparse" are both related to a decrease in numbers and are appropriate options, but "sparse" is the more appropriate choice since it directly implies a scarcity or low numbers.
Jogging is a form of cardiovascular exercise that can have numerous health benefits, such as strengthening the heart and respiratory system, improving circulation, and reducing the risk of certain diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Sweating, increased heart rate, and being tired are all possible side effects of jogging, but they do not necessarily explain the main benefit of the exercise. Eating cake is not related to the health benefits of jogging.
The sentence implies that a friend is throwing a party for another friend. The phrase "coming home" suggests that the friend is returning home after being away, which is often a reason for celebration. The other options, such as "keep secret" and "write letter," do not seem to fit the context of a celebratory party.
Smoking is commonly associated with causing damage to the respiratory system, which includes the organs responsible for breathing such as the lungs and trachea. One of the most common symptoms related to smoking and the respiratory system is a persistent cough, which is often caused by irritation and inflammation of the airways from the chemicals in cigarette smoke. The other options, death and heart attack, are potential long-term effects of smoking but are not specific symptoms related to the organ of breathing. Birth defects and bad breath are not typically associated with smoking.
Airplanes are usually stored indoors in large, enclosed spaces known as hangars. Hangars are designed to protect aircraft from the elements and provide maintenance and storage capabilities. Propellers are a component of an airplane and not a facility. The sky is not a physical structure, and military bases are not indoor facilities designed specifically for airplanes. Gardens are also not designed to hold airplanes.
The sentence states that the controversy was about the seafood restaurant getting its fresh Atlantic fish from grimy rivers around a certain location. The phrase "grimy rivers" suggests that the location may be industrial, polluted, or lacking in cleanliness. The options "new york," "city," and "coastal cities" are not specific enough to identify a location with grimy rivers, but "industrial district" is a more fitting choice because it suggests an area with factories or manufacturing that may contribute to pollution in nearby waterways. "Boston" does not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person had a talent they wanted to contribute to a cause, which indicates a willingness to give their time and effort. Writing a check or thanking God would not involve the person's talent, while teaching someone else or showing emotion are not related to donating a talent. Working for free is a common way for someone to donate their skills and would be a logical choice in this context.
The other options are related to bathing but do not necessarily pose a risk if someone is not paying attention. Dry skin can occur regardless of attention paid during bathing, using soap is a necessary part of bathing, reading a newspaper is a personal choice, and shampoo is meant to be used during bathing. However, slipping and falling can occur if someone is not paying attention and can be a serious injury risk.
illing someone is a serious and illegal act that can have severe consequences both for the victim and the perpetrator. The word "usually" suggests that the question is looking for a common outcome of killing, which is typically a negative one. The word "horrible" correctly reflects the gravity of the act and the negative consequences that follow. Remorse is a possible emotion for the perpetrator to feel after committing the crime, but it is not necessarily the outcome of the act itself. Pleasure is not a common or acceptable outcome of killing, and with a knife and funeral are more specific details that do not reflect the general outcome of killing.
The sentence suggests that the teacher expects the students to take a lot of notes during the semester, which implies that they will need something to write on. The recommended item is a notebook, which is a common tool for taking notes. The other options are not as relevant to taking notes in a class setting.
A tennis game is typically a part of a larger competition called a match, where two or more players compete against each other according to a set of rules. A match can be part of a larger tournament or championship, where players compete to win a prize or title. "Progress" and "park" do not have any clear connection to the context of a tennis game, and "field with tennis court" is not a commonly used term in tennis.
The sentence suggests that the cat was able to recognize the sound of something being opened as a signal to come. Tuna fish is a common cat food that is often opened with a can opener, and it is likely that the cat was trained to associate the sound of the can opener with the reward of getting to eat tuna fish. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Birthdays are often associated with excitement as it is a special day to celebrate oneself or someone else. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Presents and compliments are typically given on birthdays, but they do not describe the feeling. Eating every day and being expressive do not necessarily have a direct connection to birthdays.
The question is asking about a method of communication that allows for the exchange of information to large groups at work. A meeting is a common way of achieving this goal, as it allows for a group of people to gather in one place and share information in real time. The other options do not fit within the context of the question. A newspaper is not an interactive medium, a library primarily serves as a repository for information rather than a forum for discussion, television may have limited interactivity, and telegrams are an outdated method of communication.
The sentence suggests that Bailey couldn't find a parking lot in a small area, which limits the options to city, town, or business district. However, the use of "very small" implies that it is more likely to be a town, which is typically smaller than a city or business district. The other options, car and vehicle, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not places where Bailey could leave his vehicle.
The word "work" in the question suggests that the context is related to a professional setting. In workplaces, people often convene around a table to have meetings, where they discuss important matters, make decisions, or give updates. The other options – kitchen, poker, living room, and internet cafe – do not typically involve people gathering together at work.
The sentence suggests that the breaker that distributes electricity in a home is being discussed. Typically, breakers are located in the basement or utility room of a home, where the electrical panel is installed. The other options, such as bedroom, concert, opera, and back yard, do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely locations for an electrical panel.
The question is asking about a lead for a journalist, which implies that it has something to do with the process of writing or reporting news articles. The correct answer is "news article" because a lead is the opening sentence or paragraph of a news article that captures the reader's attention and summarizes the main point of the story. The other options are unrelated to journalism or news reporting.
The question is asking about where one might see a fine picture used as a background for their surroundings, which implies that it would be a larger image rather than something used on a desktop or shelf. The most common place to display a larger picture would be on a wall, making this the most likely answer. An art show may also have larger displays, but the context of the question suggests a more personal use.
The sentence suggests that the behavior being described involves helping others without expecting anything in return. This behavior is commonly referred to as altruism, which is the opposite of selfishness. The other options do not match the context of the sentence - deceptive behavior involves being dishonest, cruel behavior involves intentionally harming others, naive behavior involves being inexperienced or lacking knowledge, and weird behavior is a subjective judgment that doesn't provide any useful information.
The phrase "green thumb" is a colloquial expression used to describe someone who has a natural talent for gardening or growing plants. It implies that the person has a special ability to make plants thrive and grow healthy. The other options do not relate to the skill of gardening or plant care.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to improve their performance in a competition. Steroids are illegal and unethical to use for performance enhancement, while anger and vain thoughts wouldn't necessarily help improve performance. An adrenaline rush may offer a short-term boost, but increased effort over time would lead to sustained improvement in performance.
The sentence suggests that "glass ceiling" was used as a term or idea to describe something that was not strong enough to defeat the opponent. The term "glass ceiling" is a metaphor that refers to an invisible barrier that prevents women or other marginalized groups from achieving professional success. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is at risk of not passing a course, which would mean they did not meet the necessary requirements to earn a passing grade. In academic settings, failing a course typically means that the student will have to retake the course in order to earn credit for it. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not address the consequences of failing a course.
The word "booking office" suggests a place where reservations or tickets are sold. While some banks and malls may indeed have booking offices for specific services, the most likely place to find a general booking office would be in a city, where various types of transportation (e.g. planes, trains, buses) and entertainment (e.g. concerts, museums) are available for purchase. England is too specific and unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about where people typically make friends as an adult, suggesting a specific age range and life stage. The workplace is a common place to make friends as adults spend a significant amount of time there and share common interests and experiences with their coworkers. The other options may also be places where people make friends, but they may not be as common or specific to the adulthood stage.
Choking while eating is a serious and potentially fatal incident. The other answer choices are inappropriate in this context and do not reflect the gravity of the situation.
The question suggests that the sponge is meant to clean something, and the only option that relates to cleaning is "clean dishes." However, the option appears twice, which suggests that it is a mistake, and the correct answer must be "wet surface," which refers to the sponge's primary function of absorbing and wiping away liquid from various surfaces. "Collect water" and "hold water" are not related to cleaning, and there is already an identical option.
The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys watching something go around, which is a characteristic commonly associated with race tracks where cars or horses go around in circles. Additionally, the fact that some people find the event boring and loud fits in with the idea of a race track where the sound of engines or galloping hooves can be quite loud. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
To begin driving a car, the driver needs to have access to the car. The only way to access a car is through its keys, making this the correct answer. Practice and sight may be important for safe and effective driving, but they are not necessary to begin driving. Feet are needed to operate the pedals, but the question is asking about what is needed to even begin. Opening the car door may be necessary to enter the car, but the question pertains to what is needed to begin driving specifically.
The sentence suggests that James needed the tools immediately, indicating that he had a current need for them. The word "now" reinforces this sense of urgency. The word "remembered" implies that James forgot to pack the tools at an earlier time, possibly before he left for his current location. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "then," as he needed to remember to pack the tools at the time he was packing for his trip, rather than at a later time. The other answer choices do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the best seating location is in the center of a room for optimal viewing. The context of the sentence, "center of the room," is most commonly associated with a theatre, as that is where audiences gather to view performances. The other options, such as a bus depot or rest area, do not typically have seating arrangements where the center of the room is relevant. In a church or classroom, seating arrangements may vary based on the purpose of the room or the preferences of the attendees.
The sentence suggests that the person spends a lot of time thinking, but there is no indication that she is engaging in obsessive or compulsive behavior. The phrase "cogitate over every little thing" emphasizes that she is taking the time to think things through, which would require her to sit and contemplate. "Obsessive compulsive" is a specific condition characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behavior, which is not indicated in the sentence. "Sit quietly" may be a possible option, but it doesn't capture the active thinking implied by "cogitate." "Have brain" is not a valid option, as everyone has a brain, and "schizophrenic" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a North American country has a preference for watching matches on a soccer field. Mexico is a known soccer-loving country, with a significant portion of the population following the sport closely. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions the terms "peninsula" and "panhandle", which are commonly associated with the state of Florida in the United States. The sentence also implies that this coastal region is popular for vacationing and retirement. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence as well as Florida.
A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon, while a theory is a well-substantiated explanation that has been extensively researched and tested. To become a theory, a hypothesis must be tested and shown to be operable or viable, meaning it can be put into practice and produce consistent and accurate results. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe a necessary characteristic of a hypothesis in the process of becoming a theory.
Birth control pills are typically purchased at a pharmacy or drug store. The other options (woman's purse, Riley's, medicine cabinet, bedroom) are not common places to purchase medication.
The sentence indicates that the road passes a sign and gate house, which suggests that there is a controlled or restricted area beyond the gatehouse. The word "subdivision" refers to a type of planned residential development that often has a gated entrance and a specific set of rules for residents to follow. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either describe a different type of location (city, countryside) or a fictional place (Narnia).
The sentence suggests that the depletion of forests is having a negative impact on something larger and more significant than any of the individual options. "Earth" is a broad term that could refer to the overall health and sustainability of the planet, which is impacted by the loss of forests due to deforestation, habitat destruction, and other factors. While the other options may be indirectly affected by the loss of forests, such as woodcutting or the presence of national parks, they are not as comprehensive as the term "earth."
The sentence suggests that a store has a non-functioning train because of electricity loss. A train in a store is most commonly found in a toy store. Additionally, a toy train would likely be considered non-essential, meaning it would not be a priority for backup generators in cases of electricity loss, unlike a train station or rest area where trains are essential for transportation. The other choices have no clear connection to the sentence's context.
The sentence suggests that Bailey enjoys playing games against other people because he finds it exhilarating, which implies that he is motivated by competition. Competitiveness is often a key motivator for people who enjoy playing games, as it can be satisfying to win and improve one's skills. The other options (arguments, anger, learning, relaxation) do not necessarily have a clear connection to Bailey's motivation for playing games.
The word "few" suggests a small number of words, which is a characteristic of a sentence. Sentences are composed of a subject and a predicate, and often express a complete thought or idea. Books, newspapers, and mouths can contain many words or large amounts of text, whereas "ring true" is not related to the context of finding a few words.
The sentence mentions the brother and his wife coming to visit, which indicates that the correct answer should be related to the sister-in-law. Aunty could be a possible answer, but it is a more general term and might not be used specifically for the sister-in-law. Boy and falling down are not related to the context of the sentence, and most families is too general to be the correct answer. Niece is not a likely answer because the sentence does not suggest that the brother and sister-in-law have children.
The question is asking for a logical response to seeing food on a plate. Of the five choices, "eat" is the only appropriate response since it is natural to consume food when it is presented on a plate. "Clean" and "cook" may be necessary actions before or after the actual act of eating, but they do not address the immediate question. "Hunt" and "hungry" imply a different scenario altogether and are not relevant to the given question.
The sentence suggests that Jenny was feeling lonely and wanted to do something enjoyable. Going dancing is a common activity associated with having fun and potentially meeting new people. Fatigue and intercourse do not match the context of the sentence, and the phrase "pick up her next victim" has a negative connotation and is inappropriate.
The phrase "cloth to sleep on" implies a material that is used for bedding, which is typically kept in a linen closet. The other choices do not have any correlation to bedding or sleeping. A kitchen is typically associated with cooking and meal preparation, a fabric store sells a variety of materials but not necessarily bedding, a bedroom is where one sleeps but not where to find bedding, and a garage is primarily used for storage of vehicles and tools.
The sentence implies that the dog is lost in Copenhagen, which is the capital city of Denmark. Therefore, it is likely that the dog is of Danish nationality. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James did not prioritize socializing and was not concerned about his lack of skill in this area. Instead, he had a different goal or motivation. The phrase "didn't care" implies that he was not worried about negative consequences, such as causing trouble or experiencing anxiety. "Having fun" is a likely option, as it suggests enjoyment without the pressure of social expectations or the need to impress others. "Instigating" and "making friends" are unlikely options given the context of the sentence.
Anemones are typically found in tide pools, which are shallow depressions in rocks along the shore that fill with seawater during high tide. Tide pools are often home to a variety of marine life, including anemones, which are well-adapted to survive in the constantly changing conditions of the intertidal zone. The other choices, such as a wet pool or field of flowers, do not provide the necessary conditions for anemones to survive.
A ticket office typically refers to a place where tickets are sold or distributed for events or transportation. The context suggests that the question is asking about what kind of beings or entities you could find in a ticket office, and the most common answer would be humans because people would be working or buying tickets there. The other options are not relevant to the context of a ticket office.
The living room is typically the first room that guests would enter when visiting a home. It is also often located near the front entrance of the house. This room is a common area for entertaining guests and relaxing with family, which makes it an important feature of many homes. The other options, such as master suite and basement, are typically not located near the front entrance of the house and are less likely to be the first room you encounter when entering.
The sentence describes a situation where the speaker and their friends have the same thought or opinion. In this context, the word "agreement" refers to the act of having the same or similar beliefs or views. The other options do not accurately describe the situation described in the sentence, as they either refer to different concepts (communication, magic, happiness) or are too vague (answers).
The sentence suggests that the tennis court was frequented by an older and more refined group of people, which may indicate that it was located in a more upscale or mature setting such as a park. Health clubs and college campuses may have more diverse age groups, while a high school would likely have younger patrons. Wimbledon is a specific location and not a general descriptor, making it an unlikely answer.
The question asks where the world is known to be a part of, which suggests that the correct answer should be a larger entity that contains the world. The options "a fraud" and "thought" do not make sense in this context, while "countries" is too small of a unit to contain the world. "Galaxy" is also too big, as the world is not a part of an entire galaxy. "Universe" is the most logical option as it is the largest known entity that contains everything in existence.
Light bulbs are commonly found in lamps, which are designed specifically to hold bulbs and provide a source of light. The other options do not necessarily suggest a specific location where light bulbs are commonly found. A basement, a house, a theater, or a room could all contain light bulbs, but they are not necessarily associated with any particular type of lighting fixture or object.
Being neutral means not having a strong opinion one way or the other. Therefore, if someone is neutral about an idea becoming a reality, they are unlikely to feel a strong sense of fulfillment or elation. "Accomplished" suggests that they were actively involved in making the idea a reality, which may not be the case if they are neutral. "Feeling good" is too general and does not specifically relate to the idea becoming a reality. "Being satisfied" is the best option as it suggests a reasonable level of contentment without a strong emotional response.
The sentence mentions a bilingual city, which immediately eliminates options like NYC, big city, wine, and snow. Montreal is a famous bilingual city in Canada and has a strong French cultural influence, which explains why the character thought it was appropriate to visit a French restaurant after an ice hockey game.
The sentence implies that the jelly was opened and at risk of spoiling, so it needs to be stored properly. The most common place to store perishable items like this is in the refrigerator, which helps slow the growth of bacteria and keep the food fresher for longer. The other options do not make sense in this context - "away" is too vague, "jar" is just the container the jelly came in, "donuts" and "peanut butter" are unrelated, and none of them suggest a way to prevent spoilage.
The context of the sentence suggests that the rich kids were looking for an activity to alleviate their boredom, and the suggestion made by one of them was to go up to his parents lodge. The fact that the lodge is mentioned points to the possibility of skiing, as skiing lodges are a common type of accommodation in ski resorts. The other options do not have any direct connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a characteristic that humans possess, but dogs do not. Consciousness is a trait commonly associated with humans and not with dogs, as it refers to the awareness of one's surroundings and the ability to perceive and think. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence specifically refers to Bob resting his bottom on a chair, which is a colloquial way of saying he sat down and placed his buttocks on the chair. Therefore, the correct answer is "butt." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Parks often have tennis courts available for public use, making them a likely option for John to find a place to play tennis. Towns and Michigan do not provide any specific location for tennis courts. Venus Williams and Wimbledon are not locations where John could realistically find a tennis court to play on without further explanation or context.
The sentence suggests that the newspaper did not land on the expected location of the porch, which implies that it was thrown or delivered in a way that caused it to land elsewhere. The option "roof" is the most likely explanation for where the newspaper landed, as it is a common place for items to accidentally end up if they are thrown or dropped. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person climbing is experiencing fear as they climb higher, which suggests that they are worried about something going wrong. Out of the options, "falling down" is the most likely thing to go wrong while climbing. "Exhaustion" does not fit the context of fear, while "accomplishment" and "exhilaration" are positive feelings that do not fit with the fear suggested by the sentence. "Eagles" may be a threat in some circumstances, but it is less likely to be the cause of fear while climbing.
The sentence suggests that the person has stopped eating lunch, which could be because they have satisfied their hunger and feel full. Feeling full after a meal is a natural response that signals the body has received enough nutrients and energy to function properly. While sleepiness may occur after a large meal, it is not necessarily the reason why the person has stopped eating lunch. The other options, such as there being no more food or feeling sleepy, do not necessarily explain why the person has stopped eating.
Winning a baseball game is often associated with positive emotions such as joy, celebration, pride, being in good spirits, and overall happiness. These emotions stem from the sense of accomplishment and success achieved by the team or individual who won the game. Therefore, any of these choices could be a potential outcome after winning a baseball game.
The context of the sentence implies that Sally is looking for information about the origin of her cabinets, so the correct answer would be a location where the cabinets could have been made. The options "pantry," "planes," and "kitchen" are not places where cabinets would typically be made. "Texas" could be a potential answer, but the author's mention of checking both the undersink and oversink cabinets suggests that the cabinets were not made domestically. "Mexico" is the most likely answer since it is a country where many consumer goods, including cabinets, are manufactured.
The sentence suggests that the real estate agent intentionally sold the house for less than its actual value, which implies some kind of deception or manipulation. The other options do not convey the same meaning and are not consistent with the context of the sentence. "Incompetent" suggests a lack of skill or knowledge, which would make it unlikely for the agent to successfully sell the house at any price. "Fib" and "exaggerate" suggest less serious forms of deception that would not result in selling the house for less than its value. "Charming" does not have any clear connection to selling a house for less than it is worth.
A petting zoo is a place where visitors are encouraged to interact with animals, and typically features domesticated animals like goats, sheep, and sometimes even rabbits or guinea pigs. Snakes are not typically found in petting zoos, as they are not considered suitable animals for hands-on interactions with people. The other options describe environments where snakes can potentially be found, depending on the species - hollow logs and tropical forests, in particular, are habitats that many snake species prefer.
Drinking water is important for maintaining proper hydration in the body, which is necessary for many bodily functions such as regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients, and lubricating joints. Headaches can be a symptom of dehydration, but drinking water can relieve them. Swallowing is the action of moving food or liquid from the mouth to the stomach, and is not a purpose of drinking water. Hunger is a sensation that occurs when the body needs nutrients, not necessarily water. Vomiting is the involuntary expulsion of the contents of the stomach, and is not related to drinking water.
The sentence suggests that the small dog enjoyed taking naps on the couch, which is a piece of furniture commonly found in living rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Sam needed to rest but didn't have time to sleep, so instead he just went to the couch. This indicates that he intended to take a break but not necessarily to fall asleep. Out of the options provided, "relax" is the most appropriate choice because it suggests a state of rest without necessarily implying sleep. "Pig out" and "slow pace" are not appropriate because they suggest physical activity rather than rest, and "go to bed" implies that Sam plans to fall asleep. "Lay down" could be a valid option, but "relax" is a more general and inclusive term that encompasses the possibility of lying down as well as other restful activities.
The sentence includes the word "hurricane" which is typically associated with coastal regions. Alabama is a state situated on the Gulf of Mexico, making it one of the Gulf States - a term commonly used to refer to the states which border the Gulf of Mexico (Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas). The other choices are not as relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a food that is not sweet, implying that the other answer choices may be sweet in nature. Bitter is a taste that is often contrasted with sweet, and is used to describe foods that have a sharp, acrid, or unpleasant taste. The other answer choices do not necessarily relate to taste, or do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
An armoire is a large piece of furniture, typically used for clothing storage, and is commonly sold at furniture stores. The other options, such as living room, house, or bedroom, are locations where one might have an armoire, but not necessarily purchase one. A butcher shop also has no connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that commuters are in a hurry and need to move quickly, which suggests they are likely on a road or freeway. Both of these options are commonly associated with rush hour traffic and fast-moving vehicles, whereas the other choices (city, race track, race) do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The reference to a cow jumping over the moon is a well-known line from the nursery rhyme "Hey Diddle Diddle." The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not relate to the cultural reference being made.
Boots are often worn for prolonged periods of time, particularly for activities like hiking, working on a farm or construction site, or military training. During this time, feet can sweat and develop odor due to the lack of ventilation and moisture buildup in the boots. Therefore, it is likely that the feet will "stink" after being in boots all day. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A bookshelf is a piece of furniture specifically designed to hold books, so the correct answer needs to be a place where books are typically sold or stored. The bedroom and furniture store options are possible but less common places for bookshelves to be found. The ocean option is clearly irrelevant to the question. Therefore, the most likely answers are the library or the book store, as these are places where books are frequently found and displayed on bookshelves.
The question asks for a delta state known for good BBQ. While "backyard" and "ribs" are associated with BBQ, they do not refer to a specific state. "Louisiana" is known for its Cajun cuisine, but not necessarily for BBQ. "Restaurant" is too broad a category. "Texas," on the other hand, is famous for its BBQ, with various styles of BBQ found throughout the state.
UFO catcher machines are commonly found in game arcades and amusement parks, where customers can try to grab prizes with a mechanical claw. The other options (toy store, farm, children's room, hall) do not typically have UFO catcher machines.
The context suggests that the person is talking about an article of clothing or accessory that has a strap. A brassiere is a type of undergarment that typically has straps that need to be tightened to provide support. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the harmonica is a small instrument that can fit easily into a pocket. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that James's place was small and he constructed a playroom for his children. Since the playroom is described as unattached, it implies that it is separate from the main living area, which suggests that it was probably built in a separate structure, most likely a building. The other options such as preschool, indoor games, nursery school, and big house do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not related to James constructing a playroom for his children in a separate structure.
Forgiveness is often associated with finding peace and releasing feelings of anger and vengeance. A forgiving individual may experience a sense of inner calm and contentment rather than a desire for vengeance or the need to seek respect or good karma. While having a good heart and cultivating positive energy (good karma) may be associated with forgiveness, they are not necessarily the direct result of forgiving behavior. Similarly, forgiveness may lead to a sense of new freedom, but this is not the direct outcome that is suggested by the context of the sentence.
When someone gets punched in the nose, it can cause pain and irritation which can trigger a response from the lacrimal gland, which produces tears. Tears help to keep the eyes moist and provide lubrication, which can be helpful if the nose gets injured. The other options do not make sense in the context of being punched in the nose.
The sentence suggests that John was looking for a place to drink after work, but couldn't find a bar. Based on the context of the sentence, a nightclub would be a logical alternative option, as they often serve alcohol and stay open late at night. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The other options suggest destruction or decomposition, which is the opposite of what archaeologists would want to preserve. "Ruin" suggests the preservation or protection of the remains of the lost city, which is the goal of archaeologists in many cases. "Use" is not relevant in this context, and "rot," "waste," and "decay" suggest negative outcomes that would not be desirable for preservation efforts.
The sentence suggests that the people willingly followed rules or guidelines without being told to, implying that they had a sense of respect for authority or societal norms. The other options all suggest a deliberate act of defiance or rebellion, which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "respected."
The question suggests that a business man would keep a plane ticket with other documents, indicating that it is an important document. A briefcase is a common item used by businessmen to store important documents and items, so it is the most logical choice. The other options (boarding plane, airport, pocket, shirt sleeve) are unlikely places to store a plane ticket for safekeeping.
When discussing financial terms related to a business, debt is commonly used to refer to money owed or borrowed. The opposite of debt in this context would be a positive financial situation where the business has more money coming in than going out. This is commonly referred to as profit, which is the amount of revenue earned after deducting expenses. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to buy chocolate to use in baking a cake. Generally, one would find baking ingredients such as chocolate at a supermarket. The other options, such as a chicken stall or a restaurant, are unlikely to sell chocolate for baking purposes. A box and movie theater also do not typically sell food products.
The question describes a situation where someone's heart is racing during a public outing. This physical response is often associated with panic or anxiety, as the body's fight or flight response is triggered. Pain, embarrassment, sorrow, or tiredness do not typically cause this kind of physiological response.
The sentence suggests that the person is settling in to watch a program on a device. The options "concert" and "opera" are unlikely as they are live performances and not typically watched at home. "Computer" is not likely as it is not typically associated with watching television shows or programs. "Lamp" is not a device at all. This leaves "television" as the most logical answer.
The sentence suggests that by controlling the destiny of imaginary kingdoms, one can conquer boredom. This implies that the activity being described is a game or a form of imaginative play. While reading and watching films can be entertaining, they do not involve actively controlling an imaginary world, so they are less likely to fulfill the criteria of "controlling the destiny." Playing chess and cards are specific activities that may or may not involve imaginary kingdoms, so they are less likely to be the correct answer compared to the more general choice of "play games."
The question asks for a type of business that would help people, which suggests that the business should have a positive impact on society or the community. Nonprofit organizations are typically structured to achieve charitable or social goals without generating profit for shareholders, which aligns with the idea of helping people. The other options either have a different purpose or may be unethical, such as pyramid schemes.
The sentence suggests that there is something that is drawing ground water away from both the speaker's yard and their neighbor's yard. The most likely option is a ditch, which is a channel or trench dug to collect or convey water. The other options - house next door, next house, suburbs, trees - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to draw ground water away from the yards.
Cave paintings are a well-known example of early human artistic expression, and they were often created on cave walls. The use of the word "draw" suggests that the early humans were creating images on the cave walls, rather than doing any of the other activities listed. The idea of early humans laying eggs or eating fruit is unlikely, while making tools and competing with each other do not fit within the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is something that grows well in the sun, and the most logical option that fits this context is plants. Plants require sunlight for photosynthesis to occur, which is the process by which they produce food and energy. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence in any meaningful way.
The question is asking for a device that can play a disk in a portable manner, which suggests that the device should be small and easily transportable. A cd player is a common portable device that allows you to play a disk, and is suitable for use in a variety of locations. The other options are not relevant to the task of playing a disk on a portable device. For example, a computer hard drive needs to be connected to a computer in order to play a disk, and is not typically portable. Music and data storage are also not devices that can play disks directly. A computer store is a place to buy computer-related hardware and software, but is not a device itself.
The sentence suggests that the prisoner was known for attempting to escape frequently and that he was not successful in escaping every time. The phrase "just as often" implies that the opposite of escaping happened with the same frequency, which would be being caught. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Eating too much regularly can lead to an excess of calories, which can lead to weight gain over time. The body stores excess calories as fat, which can result in an increase in body weight. Getting full and satisfaction may occur after eating a large amount of food, but these choices do not necessarily indicate any negative consequences. Gas may be a side effect of certain foods, but it is not typically associated with overeating.
Parliament is the location where politicians in London would be found. It is the legislative body of the UK government and is located in London. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Grooming typically refers to taking care of one's appearance, such as by washing, styling or trimming hair, applying makeup or skincare, etc. Therefore, it makes sense that someone who is constantly grooming is trying to preserve or enhance their beauty. The other options, such as injury or late, do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jane is expected to perform a task with the section in class, and the most likely task would be to write it out. The other options do not make sense in the context of memorizing a section for a class. Repeating or acting it out might be useful for memorization but not necessarily for a class task. Awake and concentrate are not tasks that can be performed with a section of text.
The carotid artery is a major blood vessel located in the neck that provides the brain with oxygen-rich blood. It can be damaged by trauma or due to conditions such as atherosclerosis, which can lead to stroke or other serious health complications. The other options do not have any connection to the location of the carotid artery in the body.
The description of the ranch house overlooking unobscured mountains and valleys implies that it was located in a rural area with a natural landscape. The word "countryside" best fits this description, as it refers to areas outside of cities and urban areas that are typically characterized by open fields, farmland, and natural scenery. The other options, such as subdivision or metropolis, imply a more populated or built-up environment, which does not match the description of the location given in the sentence. Montana and desert may seem like possible choices, but they are not the best answer because they are specific locations that may not fit the context of the sentence, whereas countryside is a more general term that can describe a wide range of rural locations.
The sentence indicates that there is no need for the fire extinguisher to be in the kitchen, as no cooking is allowed in the house. The garage and outside may not be optimal locations for the extinguisher as they may not be easily accessible in case of a fire. The stairwell, on the other hand, is a central location that provides easy access from anywhere in the house and can minimize the spread of a fire to other parts of the house. Therefore, the stairwell is the most logical choice for placing a fire extinguisher in this scenario.
The sentence implies that the lack of sunshine is due to some external condition rather than the sun itself. The word "cloudy" suggests that the weather was overcast and therefore blocked the sun's rays. The other options are not related to weather conditions and do not provide any logical explanation for the absence of sunshine.
The sentence suggests that the person is bathing and brushing their hair at the same time, which indicates that they are likely in the shower. It makes sense to store a round brush in a place where it is easily accessible when needed, and the shower would be the most convenient place to do so. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to what activities or experiences one can have while sleeping. Dreams and nightmares are both common experiences during sleep, while relaxation is a state of being that one may encounter while falling asleep or during deep sleep. Bad dreams are a type of nightmare, and so can happen while sleeping. "Having fun" typically requires a level of conscious effort and awareness which is not present during sleep, making it the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person Sally knows works at a distillery and takes public transportation to get there. Distilleries are known for producing alcohol, not cake, catching a cold, or wearing jeans. The only choice that is related to alcohol production is "make wine," which is a common job in a distillery. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The decision to buy a play mat and put it in front of the TV suggests that the family intended to use it as a form of entertainment or recreation. The living room is a common area in the house for relaxation and watching TV, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not make sense in this context - a play mat would not be practical in a pool or a bathroom and it would be unlikely for a school to allow a play mat in their classrooms. A doorway also does not make sense as it is a thoroughfare rather than a designated area for play.
Birthday parties are typically held in homes, making it the most likely option for where a person might play an acoustic guitar at such an event. Studios and music shops are more professional settings, while playing at a funeral place would be inappropriate for a joyous occasion like a birthday party. Closets are unlikely to be a suitable location for playing music or hosting a party.
The sentence suggests that the man was adding flooring to a space above his garage, which is a common area to convert into a loft. A loft is a space that is open to the rest of the house and is typically used as a living area or office. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a bedroom, kitchen, or house would typically already be built and not have flooring added to them. Home Depot is a store and not a space that can be created.
The question is asking for an alternative to buying eggs from the supermarket. The options "farm" and "henhouse" are too broad and do not provide a clear solution to the problem of obtaining eggs. "Plate" is clearly not a viable option since it is not an object or method for obtaining eggs. "Bird's nest" is also not a practical solution since it is unlikely that wild birds would lay eggs in a location accessible to humans. "Chicken coop," on the other hand, is a place where domesticated hens can lay eggs that are fresh, healthy, and easily accessible to their owners.
The sentence implies that the child was lacking something from their parents, which is likely emotional support or companionship. The word "lonely" confirms this assumption. Therefore, the correct answer should be related to the child's desire to have their parents around or to be with them. "Presence" best fits this context. The other options do not make sense in this sentence.
An atlas is a collection of maps, so it is the most likely place to find a lot of maps. The other options do not have any clear association with maps. An amusement park and backpack would not be places to find maps, while drawing and classroom could potentially have maps, but not necessarily in large quantities.
The context suggests that Sean's clothes were of low quality, which may be indicated by his clothes being described as "not high quality" and "very" something negative. "Cheap" is the best fit for this as it implies low cost and low quality. The other options do not necessarily suggest that Sean's clothes were inexpensive or low quality.
The context of the sentence suggests that people who are having difficulties require support from others. "Need each other" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of dependence and mutual assistance, which is commonly associated with people facing tough situations. The other options do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the noisy, flashing "one-armed bandits" refer to slot machines, which are often found in casinos. The phrase "if she was going to play" indicates that the person is considering gambling, and the phrase "she was going to be" suggests that there will be a certain outcome or behavior associated with that decision. The option "spending money" is the most likely choice, as gambling often involves risking money in the hopes of winning more. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Billy is collecting leaves from nature, rather than from man-made objects like compost piles or floral arrangements. Trees are a natural source of leaves, and forests are a common location for trees, making the option "forest" also a plausible answer. The options "bathroom" and "compost pile" do not have any clear connection to finding leaves for a collection.
The question suggests that the answer is a geographical region in the southern United States and that this region is known for having venomous snakes. The option "western Texas" is a geographic location in the southern United States that is known to have a variety of venomous snakes, including rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Billy did not take a side between two friends or groups of people. The phrase "in between" means the space or position that separates two things or people, which is the most fitting description of Billy's stance. The other options do not accurately describe a neutral position where someone would not have to pick a side.
The sentence suggests that the person needs a stapler and index card, which are commonly found in an office setting. The other options, oral report, book store, library, and card catalogue, do not typically sell office supplies. Office supply stores typically carry a wide range of office-related products, including staplers and index cards. Therefore, an office supply store would be the best option to purchase these items.
The sentence suggests that the people who die from dehydration were playing games excessively, indicating that they were likely playing video games or computer games. Of the choices given, only the internet cafe is a place where someone might spend an extended amount of time playing games on a computer or video game console. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the answer is related to the outcome of the Civil War. Therefore, the answer should be a location that was further towards the winning side of the war. States such as Michigan and Minnesota were not directly involved in the Civil War and do not have a clear connection to the sentence. A hospital may be located in any state or city, so it does not provide any useful information. The correct answer is likely to be a city located in a region that was further towards the side that won the war.
The sentence mentions "robots" and implies that sometimes people may act like emotionless machines. However, it goes on to suggest that this is not the case and that we are all actually something else. The correct answer, therefore, needs to be a word that is the opposite of robotic or mechanical. Of the options given, "human" is the only one that fits this description, as it refers to our species and our capacity for emotions and free will. The other options are either too negative or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that James walked barefoot on something that was made hot by sunshine. This suggests that he was walking on a surface that absorbs heat from the sun, such as asphalt or concrete, which are commonly found on streets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
High rises are typically tall buildings with many floors, so the correct answer is likely to be related to construction. The sentence mentions windows, which are a common feature on buildings to allow for light and ventilation. The options "warehouse," "friend's house," and "wall" are unlikely to be made primarily of windows, and "space shuttle" is not a type of building at all.
The sentence suggests that gardeners in different states value bees as pollinators, which implies that bees are commonly found in gardens where they are needed to pollinate plants. Since options like 'apiary' or 'Michigan' refer to specific locations rather than a general setting or environment, they are unlikely to be the correct answer. Similarly, 'trees' does not fully capture the idea of bees as pollinators since not all trees require bees for pollination. Therefore, the most relevant and specific option among the choices is 'field of flowers.'
A car show is an event where car enthusiasts gather to display and view beautiful cars. It is a common place to find a variety of beautifully designed and maintained cars, some of which may be rare or expensive. The other options may contain cars, but they do not necessarily have a focus on displaying or showcasing them in a way that would suggest a concentration of beautiful cars.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a piece of furniture that is suitable for guests to sleep on in their living room, indicating that the correct answer is likely to be a type of furniture. Out of the options given, only the living room fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a type of person who is more likely to get an illness. Studies show that elderly individuals are more susceptible to illnesses due to their weakened immune systems, higher risk of chronic conditions, and other factors associated with aging. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Contraceptive devices are used to prevent pregnancy, which is the creation of a child. The other options, such as person, drug store, and pharmacy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person in question is studying constantly, which suggests that they are trying to gain as much knowledge as possible. The phrase "know everything" is the most appropriate choice in this context, as it aligns with the idea of someone who is constantly studying. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "own house" and "make more money" are unrelated to studying, "spare time" suggests that the person is not making efficient use of their time, and "show off" implies that the person is studying with the intention of impressing others rather than gaining knowledge.
A car needs a fuel source to generate the energy necessary to move, and gas is the most common fuel source for cars. Accidents and traffic accidents do not cause a car to move, they are events that may occur while a car is moving. A ticket is a consequence of breaking traffic laws, but it does not cause a car to move. Driving is the action taken to operate a car, but it is not the cause of movement.
Water turning turbines is a characteristic of hydroelectric power generation, which is typically done in large structures called hydroelectric dams. Puddles, sump pumps, underground streams, and sinks do not have the infrastructure or characteristics necessary for hydroelectric power generation.
The phrase "common goal" implies that both people have a shared objective they want to achieve. The most effective way to achieve this goal would be to collaborate and work together towards a solution. Agreeing with each other may help to start the process, but it does not necessarily guarantee that the goal will be achieved. Making love and having fun are not relevant to the context of the question. Shaking hands is a social gesture that signifies a greeting or agreement, but it does not provide any information on how to accomplish a shared goal.
Working from home typically entails the use of a computer to access work-related resources and complete tasks. Installing a program would also require the use of a computer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone is pretending to be an action figure but is not trying to sell action figures. This implies that the person is likely performing or acting, rather than simply displaying or selling toys. The options of bathtub, museum, and store do not fit this context. While a toy store may have action figures for sale, it does not necessarily imply that someone would be pretending to be an action figure there. The theater is the most likely setting for someone to be pretending to be an action figure for a performance or play.
Storing candy in an airtight container is a common way to keep it from going stale. A jar is a type of container that can be sealed with a lid to keep air out, making it a logical choice for storing candy. The other options - trunk of car, movies, Disneyland, and supermarket - do not make sense in the context of storing candy to keep it from going stale.
A piggy bank is a common place for kids to put their coins in their room, as it is a designated container for storing money. A wishing well is not typically found in a child's room and is more commonly associated with making wishes. A parking meter is not a logical location for a child's coin in their room. Putting money under a pillow is a traditional practice for the tooth fairy to leave money in exchange for a lost tooth, but it is not a common long-term storage solution for coins. A change purse is also a possible option, but it may not be as commonly used or associated with children as a piggy bank.
The sentence suggests that science is a challenging subject, which implies that some subjects may be considered easier or purer in comparison. Math is a subject that is often considered to have a logical and structured approach to problem-solving, which may be seen as purer or more straightforward than science. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, nor are they commonly considered purer subjects than science.
The phrase "in your neck of the woods" means nearby or in your immediate area. The other choices may also have a grocery store, but they do not necessarily indicate proximity to the speaker. However, the word "neighborhood" suggests a local area, which is likely to have a nearby grocery store. Therefore, the correct answer is neighborhood.
The sentence suggests that the person playing the fiddle is doing so in a haphazard or random manner, meaning that there is no predictable pattern to their playing. As a result, it is unlikely that they will play a specific song next, and instead their playing may be influenced by various factors such as their mood or surroundings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that some people find socializing to be enjoyable. The phrase "way of" indicates that socializing is a means or method for achieving something. The options "anxiety," "become more popular," and "become popular" do not fit with the idea of socializing as a positive thing. "Meeting new people" could be a possible answer, but the word "enjoy" suggests that the purpose of socializing is to have a good time, which is best reflected in the option "having fun."
The sentence suggests that the man requested a tissue holder to be installed in a specific location at the dealership that would be easily accessible or convenient for customers to use. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a "convenient spot." The other options do not make sense in the context of a dealership as they refer to places like a bathroom or bedroom, office, airplane, or car, which are not directly related to the dealership environment.
Beavers are known for building dams and lodges in wooded areas near bodies of water. This is because they need access to both water and trees in order to survive. Ontario and Canada are both locations where beavers can be found, but they do not answer the question of what kind of habitat the beaver lives in. Marshlands are not typically a preferred habitat for beavers because they do not provide the necessary building materials. A zoo is not a natural habitat for any animal.
The sentence suggests that waiting until the last minute to buy Christmas presents will result in some form of negative experience. The option "debt" may be a consequence of waiting until the last minute to shop, but it is not directly related to the experience of waiting. "Pleasure" and "good cheer" are positive experiences that are unlikely to result from waiting until the last minute to buy Christmas presents. "Lack of money" may also be a consequence of waiting until the last minute, but it does not specifically relate to the experience of waiting. Therefore, "stress" is the most likely correct answer as it is a common negative experience associated with procrastination and last-minute shopping.
The sentence indicates that the show was done live, implying that there was a risk associated with the live performance. The word "producers" suggests that this risk was related to the production aspect of the show. The word "worried" indicates that the producers were concerned about something that could have gone wrong during the live broadcast. Since the five options given are related to the production and broadcast of a show, the correct answer is most likely the one that fits best in the context of the sentence. In this case, "audio" seems like the most reasonable choice since sound quality is a common challenge in producing live events. The other options either do not fit the context of the sentence or are not specific enough.
Gazelles are typically found in grasslands and steppe environments, which provide them with the space to run and jump freely. Wildife refuges and encyclopedias are not types of terrain, while an open field could work but does not specifically indicate the type of grassland environment that gazelles prefer.
The sentence suggests that Sarah prefers loose clothing and doesn't like showing off her curves. Form fitting clothes are the opposite of loose clothes and are designed to hug the curves of the body, which Sarah may find uncomfortable or revealing. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the speaker is trying to purchase food, and the cashier has given a requirement for making the purchase. In this case, the requirement is to spend money, as food is typically not free. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence - driving a car or feeling hunger may be related to obtaining food, but they are not requirements for making a purchase. Needing to eat is also not a requirement for buying food, as someone could be buying food for someone else.
The name Cinderella is most commonly associated with the fairy tale character of the same name. The other options listed do not have any clear association with the name Cinderella, making them unlikely choices for the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that someone has been warned about the sharpness of an object, but continues to cut themselves. This behavior could be described as someone who is not paying attention or observing the warning, which aligns with the definition of unobservant. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior in the sentence.
The question is asking about the action that is typically taken during the time frame of having lunch. Lunch is a mealtime where individuals usually consume food, and therefore, the correct answer is "eat food". The other options may be things that individuals also do during lunchtime, but they are not the primary action that is being asked for in the question.
The sentence suggests that James is standing in front of his computer and the monitor is lighting up the room. If James is standing in front of the monitor, his body would likely cast a shadow on the wall or other objects behind him. None of the other choices are likely outcomes in this scenario.
The sentence suggests that a court case with a tough judging may have serious consequences, such as going to jail. The other options do not necessarily follow from the context of the sentence. "Being judged" is a general outcome of a court case but does not necessarily imply a tough judgment or serious consequences, while "responsibility" and "feeling guilty" are more emotional or personal outcomes rather than legal ones. "Killing" is not related to the context at all.
The sentence implies that the setting is a theater or performance venue, as people are rushing down the aisles in response to a fire alarm. The word "opera" is the only choice that is related to a specific type of performance, while the other options ("mind," "war," "quandary," "breath") do not have an obvious link to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the location where the person eats most of their food, which suggests that they are referring to a place where they regularly consume food. The option "in a bowl" only refers to a type of dishware and is not a location. "Freezer" and "store" are places where food is stored or purchased, respectively. "Kitchen" is a possible location where one might eat, but it is not as specific as "home." Therefore, "home" is the most suitable answer.
The sentence suggests that the archaeologist encountered artifacts that were confusing or did not fit with his current understanding. In this situation, it would be logical for him to take a step back and consider his options, such as conducting further research or seeking out expert opinions. The options "angry," "painful memories," and "learning" do not fit with the context of the sentence and are irrelevant. "Thinking" could be a plausible answer, but "consider the options" is a more precise and actionable choice that directly addresses the archaeologist's dilemma.
The sentence implies that the woman is pushing herself to jog faster and faster, which suggests that she is trying to improve her physical fitness. Fitness is often associated with activities like jogging and running that require endurance and stamina. The other options are not necessarily related to improving physical fitness, but rather may be consequences or side effects of exercising, such as sweating or fatigue.
The sentence references a "card slot for casino member points," which indicates that the device is found in a casino and is likely related to gambling. Of the options given, only a slot machine fits this description. The other options are either unrelated to casinos or do not have a card slot for member points.
The sentence suggests that the employees were not performing well and needed some sort of assistance, possibly in the form of meetings. The choice "understanding" makes sense as the meetings may have been aimed at helping the employees gain a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities or how to improve their work. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about what customers could do after being served by the speaker. While all of the choices are possible actions, the most appropriate answer is "smile" as it is a common social response after receiving service or help from someone. The other options are less likely or inappropriate for this context, such as "scream" or "make money."
The sentence suggests that the container needs to be large, rectangular, and able to keep moths away. A trunk fits this description, as it is typically a large, rectangular container with a tight-fitting lid that keeps out bugs and dust. Basements are not containers, but rather a space in which items can be stored. Trash and trash box are not good choices for storing clothes, as they are not designed to protect anything from the environment.
The sentence implies that the person watching TV has a desire to learn more about what is being shown on the TV. Searching the web is the most appropriate choice here, as it allows the person to easily access additional information and resources about what they are watching. The other choices are either not relevant to the situation (such as going somewhere), or do not provide a practical way to explore the topic further (such as simply watching a favorite show or reading a book). Analyzing is also a possibility, but it is less practical for casual viewing and may not be suitable in this context.
The question specifies that the person wants to buy a condominium near the Pacific ocean. Washington and California are both states located along the Pacific coast, so the answer should be one of those two. Since the question doesn't provide any further information about specific cities, "community" would be the best answer as it refers to a general area or residential district rather than a specific state or complex. Florida and Michigan are not located on the Pacific coast, so they can be eliminated as possible answers. Similarly, "complex" is too specific and doesn't provide any information about the location of the condominium.
The sentence suggests that James was not comfortable sleeping on Mary's hide sofa bed. Since the options provided are all places to find a place to sleep, we can eliminate apartment, guest room, and house as choices because they are all places that are likely to have similar sleeping arrangements to Mary's. Couch is a possibility, but it's not clear whether there is a couch available for James to sleep on. So the most logical choice based on the information given is hotel, as it is a place specifically designed for people to stay and sleep comfortably.
The sentence suggests that the speaker did not like the older blanket, indicating that it was likely heavy, difficult to manage or move, and possibly even burdensome. The word "cumbersome" is commonly used to describe objects that are difficult or unwieldy to handle, making it an appropriate choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is suggesting that the person is losing and looking at their opponent's score. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the person may feel jealous of their opponent's success. Jealousy is a common emotion that people experience when they feel threatened by someone else's success. The other options, such as anger, hatred, and seeing work, do not fit well with the context of the sentence.
This question is asking about the process of procreation, which typically involves sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. "Make love" is a euphemism for sexual activity and is commonly associated with the act of conceiving children. The other options are not relevant to the process of having biological children.
The question implies that friends are giving advice to a member of the priesthood in a new church about improving their physical health. The word "shape" suggests that the person may need to exercise and improve their fitness level. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that to become great at fiddling, one needs to do something repeatedly to improve their skills. This is commonly associated with practice, which is an essential component of learning and mastery in any skill-based activity. The other options do not have any explicit connection to the context of the sentence.
A shopping bag is typically used to carry items purchased at a retail store, which is where you would typically find clothes for sale. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not typically associated with selling clothing. A grocery store, for example, is where you would buy food items, while a pharmacy is where you would buy medications and health-related products.
The sentence suggests that the group was performing live when the guitarist smashed his guitar, which is a behavior commonly associated with rock concerts. Rock music is often perceived as loud and energetic, which may explain the rowdy behavior of the group. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Altars are commonly associated with religious or ceremonial settings, where activities such as praying, performing rituals, or conducting services may take place. The word "ceremony" in the options best fits the context of the sentence, as it represents a formal event or occasion that may involve the use of an altar. The other options, such as temple, church services, or sanctuary, are also associated with religious settings, but do not specifically indicate a need for an altar.
The sentence suggests that a drug dealer has been convicted of a felony, which typically leads to a sentence of incarceration. Prison is the most likely option, as it is where individuals convicted of serious crimes are sent to serve their sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are not likely locations for someone who has been convicted of a felony.
The sentence establishes that the man was gentle but also worked out, suggesting that his muscles may have been developed as a result. The word "hard" is commonly used to describe well-developed or toned muscles, and it aligns with the context of the sentence. The other choices lack a clear connection to the context of the sentence or do not accurately describe the muscular condition of the man.
The sentence suggests that people specifically go to a location to view famous pictures, and "art show" is the only option that fits this context. A "window" or "trunk" is not a place where pictures would be displayed for viewing, and "newspaper" or "books" may contain pictures but do not refer to a specific location where famous pictures can be seen.
The context of the sentence suggests that when gentlemen need to talk, they likely have a specific purpose or agenda to discuss, which would typically occur in a meeting. This could be a business meeting or a social gathering. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, with the men's room being a place for restroom facilities, meditation centers being reserved for quiet reflection rather than discussions, church being a place of worship rather than discussion, and Europe being a continent rather than a specific location or activity.
Combustion engines require oil to operate effectively. This is because oil lubricates the moving parts of the engine and helps to prevent friction and wear. Ground, human body, repair shop, and service station do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Jumping rope involves timing and coordination, which are key elements of rhythm. The repetitiveness of the movement can also help develop a sense of rhythm over time. The other options do not relate to the physical or mental sensations associated with jumping rope.
The sentence suggests that politicians often talk about small time farmers, but in reality, most farms are related to finance or money. This may suggest that politicians are not fully aware of the actuality of farming or are using farming as a political tool to gain votes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for something that can provide a comfortable sleeping space for a puppy outside, which suggests an item designed specifically for a dog's needs. A dog house or kennel is a common option for providing shelter and a designated sleeping area for a dog. A table or tree would not be suitable for a dog's sleeping needs, and a "home" is too general of an answer to provide a clear solution.
The answer cannot be dictionary because it is not a location where John could have looked for beavers. The options America, Australia, countryside, and woodlands are all plausible locations where beavers could be found, but without further context it is impossible to determine which one is the correct answer.
The sentence describes a scenario where someone is drinking beer and watching men play a sport with a black and white ball using their feet. This is a common combination associated with soccer games, as they are often watched in social settings with drinks and snacks. The other options, such as shelf, refrigerator, can, and yacht, are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The question asks specifically for a location where a vegetarian restaurant can be found. While it is possible for vegetarian restaurants to be found in any of the listed locations, the sentence does not provide any evidence for this. However, San Francisco is known for having a large number of vegetarian and vegan restaurants, so it is the most likely option based on the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the wind was heading in one direction and then suddenly changed course, which suggests that it "changed direction." The other options describe different aspects of wind, such as "wave wheat" (a visual effect caused by wind blowing through fields of wheat) or "wind gust" (a sudden burst of wind). "Dry hair" and "blowing hard" are not directly related to the wind changing direction.
Guns and people in uniform are commonly associated with the military. Military bases are locations where military personnel and equipment are stationed, including guns and other weapons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the team was traveling for a sporting event, and the equipment manager was responsible for bringing the team's sports equipment off the bus. It makes sense that the equipment would be brought to an arena or stadium where the game or event would be taking place. The other options, such as school, sears, fair, or mall, do not seem to be relevant to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "ground floor" refers to the lowest floor of a building, typically where the main entrance is located. While some of the other options (such as a closet or a desk) can also be located on the ground floor, they are not typically associated with this term. Tile and table are not items that typically have a ground floor as they are not buildings.
The sentence suggests that a bee could get stuck easily in a specific location. Soft drinks often contain a sugary substance that attracts bees, and they may accidentally fall into the liquid and become trapped. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where dust accumulates, meaning where it builds up over time. While dust can accumulate in many places, the context of the question suggests that the answer is a location that is elevated or overhead, such as a ceiling. Dust can also accumulate on surfaces like a desktop or the floor, but those options are not as specific to the context of the question. The library and most buildings are too broad and could apply to many places within those locations, but the ceiling is a clear and specific answer that matches the context of the question.
Montana is a state that is known for having wide-open spaces and a relatively low risk of natural disasters like mudslides, fires, and earthquakes. Additionally, Montana is known to have more lenient zoning codes than some other states, which may make it a better fit for someone who wants to build a ranch house. The other options, such as California or the West in general, have a higher risk of natural disasters and may have more restrictive zoning codes. Outback is not a state, but rather a term used to describe remote areas of Australia. Texas may also have some restrictions around building regulations and has experienced natural disasters in the past.
The sentence suggests that the person was married to someone who takes everything, which implies a lack of equality and possibly control or abuse in the relationship. After leaving such a relationship, it is common to experience a sense of detachment from the former partner as a way of self-protection and healing. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely outcomes of the situation described.
The sentence suggests that there is a biological purpose behind eating breakfast, which could involve giving the body energy for the day ahead. Breakfast is often thought to be an important meal because it provides the body with the nutrients needed to fuel physical and mental performance. The other options do not align with this idea and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the farmer was using a part of something to plant in the ground, indicating that it must be some sort of seed or sprout. Potatoes have "eyes," which are small buds that sprout into potato plants, so it is likely that the farmer was scooping potato eyes to plant. The other options (elephant, person's head, faces, and mammal) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely candidates for being scooped out and planted in the ground.
The question is asking for the benefit of going jogging in terms of prevention. Heart attacks are commonly associated with a sedentary lifestyle, so engaging in physical activity like jogging can help prevent them. The other options have no clear correlation to jogging or the prevention of heart attacks.
The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating together at work, which implies a shared space like a cafeteria. A formal dining room and doing jigsaw puzzles on (assuming the end of the sentence is cut off) are unlikely options in a work setting. A conference room could be an option for some workplaces, but it is less common than a cafeteria. The word "house" is also unlikely since the context of the sentence specifically mentions "at work."
Snakes are known to be fond of tight, enclosed spaces where they can hide and feel secure. Hollow logs are a prime target for snakes, as they can easily slip inside and remain hidden from view. The other options have no clear association with snakes or their behavior, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence mentions a Pacific beach, which is a geographical clue pointing towards the west coast of North America. Among the options provided, Washington is the only state that is located on the west coast and borders the Pacific Ocean. The other options are either not located in North America or are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Elephants are most commonly associated with Africa, where they have been native to for thousands of years. While there are also elephants in Asia, particularly in India and parts of Southeast Asia, the sentence does not provide any clear indication that the reference is to Asian elephants. The reference to circus and zoo is not relevant to the origin of elephants.
The sentence suggests that the music was downloaded without paying, which indicates that it was obtained illegally. The word "stolen" means taking something without permission, and this makes sense in the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit the context as they do not indicate any illegal act. Opera is a music genre, composed and written on paper are common processes in creating music, and uploaded is a neutral process that does not indicate any action.
The sentence implies that the location in question is a place where a child may play with a wagon. Out of the given options, a backyard is the most likely spot for a child to play with toys, especially wagons. A field may also be a possibility, but it is less likely than a backyard. A tool box, toy store, and garage are not likely options, as they do not convey the sense of playfulness suggested by the sentence.
A newspaper is a form of media that traditionally provides information about current events, news, and developments to its readers. The word "newspaper" itself suggests that it is a source for new information. Other options such as announce, defend, educate, and communicate may all be a part of what a newspaper does, but informing readers is its primary purpose.
In a university setting, a building named "hall" is most likely to be a dormitory, which is a large building that houses students. Conference rooms and small classrooms are typically named after their intended use, while "large building" and "inside" are too vague to provide any clues. "Dormitory" is the only option that fits the context of the question as it is a common type of building found on university campuses that is often referred to as a "hall."
The question is asking about a place for relaxation specifically for gentlemen. While some of the options may be relaxing settings (such as a restaurant or cinema), a meditation center is a place that is traditionally associated with relaxation and inner peace. The term "gentleman" may suggest a preference for a peaceful, quiet atmosphere, making a meditation center the most likely option. The other choices do not have a direct connection to relaxation or the specific characteristics of a gentleman's preferred setting.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a potential benefit of using a computer for someone who is blind. Since someone who is blind cannot see the computer screen, they would not experience eye strain from looking at it. The other options are not related to the specific context of computer use for someone who is blind.
The sentence suggests that Jan is a responsible and efficient person who works in a zoo. The phrase "put together" is commonly used to describe someone who is organized and capable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either refer to things/people unrelated to the situation or have a negative connotation.
A venue is a place where events or performances are held, and it often requires tickets for admission. The other options are not typically associated with concerts or performances. An amusement park and fairgrounds may have performances, but they would not likely require a ticket booth for entry. A toll plaza is a location on a roadway where tolls are collected, and an auditorium may require tickets but is not commonly associated with concerts.
The sentence suggests that exploring all avenues is important for maintaining peace and preventing something negative from happening. The choice of words, such as "maintain peace" and "avoid," suggests that something bad might happen if peaceful measures are not taken. The use of the word "violent" suggests that this bad thing might be an outbreak of violence. The other options, such as "elusive" and "peacework," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Unprotected sex refers to sexual activity without the use of a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom or diaphragm. The most common consequence of unprotected sex is pregnancy, as sperm can fertilize an egg and result in a pregnancy. However, unprotected sex can also result in the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes. Orgasm and giggle are not consequences of unprotected sex, but rather physiological or emotional responses during sexual activity.
The sentence suggests that gravity is holding down air, which means the air is located close to the ground. The most logical answer would be the surface of the earth, as that is where the ground and air are in close proximity. The other options, such as sky, space shuttle, cupboard, or house, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not directly related to air being held down by gravity.
The sentence implies that the person being referred to has had multiple places of residence in their lifetime since they always had a night table in every place they lived. The options "furniture store" and "hallway" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Hotel" could be a possibility, but the use of the word "lived" suggests a more permanent residence, which is why "homes" is the correct choice.
The sentence suggests that there is a line outside of the hot-dog stand, which typically means that people are waiting for their turn to order food. "Wait turn" is a phrase commonly used to describe queuing or standing in line to obtain a service. The other options, such as "tickets," "circus act," "polite" and "money from bank," do not make sense in the context of people lining up for food.
The sentence suggests that lawyers spend a lot of time doing paperwork and researching, which is a key part of their job. The other options such as "food" or "courtroom" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "keep quiet" is not related to a lawyer's job duties. "Office building" could be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "work" and does not capture the essence of what lawyers do.
The sentence implies that being fat may motivate a person to do something specific in the gym. The phrase "lose weight" directly addresses the issue of being overweight, which is likely the reason for going to the gym in the first place. The other options are also related to fitness and health, but they are not as directly tied to the issue of weight loss.
The sentence mentions a ferris wheel, which is typically found at a carnival or fair. Peanuts are also a common snack sold at such events. The other options, such as a barn, ballpark, jar, or plane, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A parking lot is typically accessed from a street or road. A town or neighborhood could contain multiple streets, but the options of strip mall and sewer do not make sense as points of entry for a parking lot.
The sentence suggests that Joe's food had a bad and bitter taste. "Rotten" is a common cause of bad tasting food, as rotting organic matter can release toxins and produce a sour or bitter flavor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are not related to the idea of bad taste in food.
The term "tree hugger" is often used to describe someone who is passionate about environmental conservation and preservation. Forests and rainforests are important ecosystems that are often the focus of conservation efforts, so it is likely that a tree hugger would reside in or near these areas. San Francisco and university do not have a clear connection to environmental conservation, while state park may be a possible location for a tree hugger but it is not as strongly associated with conservation efforts as forests and rainforests.
The sentence suggests that working out too hard can have a negative consequence, which is likely to be physical discomfort or pain. Losing weight and loss of water can happen as a result of exercise, but they are not consequences of working out too hard specifically. Exercise and feeling better are benefits of working out, so they cannot be the negative consequence mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is in need of shelter from the cold and wet conditions they are experiencing. A building may provide this shelter, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to the need for shelter from the weather. Back home may be an option if it is nearby, but it is not explicitly stated if the person has a home nearby. The hospital and demonstration options do not relate to the person's immediate need for shelter. The bus stop may provide some temporary shelter, but it is not an ideal option for someone who is cold and wet.
Ultrasound is a medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs and tissues. During pregnancy, an ultrasound can be used to determine the sex of the baby. It is not related to the other options, which do not have any clear connection to pregnancy or ultrasound technology.
The question asks for a bad but frequent reason for hurting someone else. Punishment can be a bad reason because it may lead to further harm, and it does not necessarily address the root cause of the behavior that led to the need for punishment in the first place. The other options do not necessarily imply a direct intent to hurt someone else.
The phrase "blocking someone in a driveway" suggests that a person is preventing another from being able to move a car out of a parking space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that a gentleman is looking for a place to go that is not a theater. Out of the choices given, a suit and Europe are not places that one would typically go to. A movie is a form of entertainment, similar to a theater, so it is unlikely that this would be the correct answer. A garden is also a leisurely place, but it may not be appropriate for a gentleman in certain contexts. On the other hand, going to church is a common option for many people, including gentlemen, seeking places to go outside of the theater.
The sentence suggests that the windshield is used to protect from spray and wind, which is a common feature of motor vehicles such as cars. While motorboats and airplanes also have windscreens, they are not typically described as being used for "spray", which suggests that they are not the correct answer. While motorcycles also have windscreens, the sentence does not specify that the windshield is on a motorcycle, but instead uses the more general term "motor vehicle".
After heavy exercise, muscles can become sore and tense. Stretching can help alleviate muscle stiffness and restore flexibility. Therefore, it is likely that a person who exercised heavily the day before will stretch when they wake up to helps loosen their muscles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the effects of heavy exercise on the body.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a police officer who is not stopping cars but who is outside. The only logical choice is the police station, as police officers are often outside the station interacting with the public or taking a break. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks specifically about a workplace that employs a large number of writers for a daily publication. This context is most commonly associated with newspaper offices, where reporters and writers work to produce daily news articles for publication. While universities may also employ writers, they typically do not produce daily publications. Factories and advertising firms are also unlikely to employ a large number of writers, and may not produce written content on a daily basis.
The word "profound" suggests that the question was deep and thought-provoking, which would likely prompt the students to stop and consider their answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of a profound question.
The sentence mentions a bat being abducted and absconded, which suggests a location where bats might be found. A belfry is a tower or room in a church or building where bells are hung, and is commonly associated with bats due to their tendency to roost in these areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "athletes" suggests that the context is related to sports. The only option that is clearly connected to sports is "sporting event". The other options are not related to athletics or cheering for athletes. A movie theater typically shows movies, a theatre typically shows plays or musicals, a church typically holds religious services, and a concert typically features musical performances.
The sentence states that the nightclub owner was not skilled in business, but the club still did well. This suggests that the success of the club was due to factors outside of the owner's control, such as the location. The option "downtown area" fits this context because prime locations for nightclubs are often found in busy areas with a lot of foot traffic and entertainment options. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a television allows you to take in both audio and visual information. While it may also provide entertainment and news, these options are not specific to the question being asked. Eye strain and boredom are not types of information that a television can provide.
The sentence suggests that there is a city known for having great pizza places. Chicago is famous for its deep-dish pizza, and is often considered one of the best cities for pizza lovers. Buffalo and Little Italy are known for having great Italian food, but not necessarily specifically for pizza. Food court is a generic term for a shopping mall dining area and is not a city. Capital cities can have great food, but this does not give enough information to determine which city is specifically known for its pizzerias.
The sentence suggests that the answer should relate to something in the woods that provides shelter. Trees are commonly found in wooded areas and often offer shelter to animals and humans alike from the elements. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that koalas typically live in a certain type of environment or tree, which the koala in question could not find. The phrase "it made its home at the top of something else" suggests that the koala found a substitute habitat, which in this case is likely to be a gum tree. Gum trees are native to Australia and are known to be a common habitat for koalas. The other options do not relate to the natural habitat of koalas.
Divorce is a legal process that involves navigating complex laws and regulations. A lawyer is a trained legal professional who can provide guidance and assist with filing the necessary paperwork. The other options do not provide any clear direction on who to speak with regarding a divorce.
Furnaces can be located in a variety of places within a home, depending on the type of furnace being used and the layout of the home. Some furnaces may be located in a designated boiler room, while others may be in a basement or cellar. In some houses, the furnace may be located in a separate room or closet within the living space. Therefore, depending on the specific home and furnace, the location could potentially be any of the options given.
issing outside can expose an individual to cold temperatures, which can cause them to catch a cold. This is a common health concern associated with being outside in colder weather. While sexual stimulation can also occur during kissing, it is not necessarily a guaranteed result of kissing outside. Herpes and outbursts are not typically associated with kissing outside.
The sentence suggests that the person was consuming more calories than they were burning, which is a common cause of obesity. Obesity is a medical condition that occurs when a person's body mass index (BMI) is above a certain threshold, usually around 30. The other choices are not relevant to the context of the sentence - feeling full may be a consequence of overeating, but it does not relate to the medical condition of obesity.
The sentence mentions that wine and cheese were served after everyone saw exhibits and installations. This suggests that the location was most likely an art show or exhibition. The other options (bar, cemetery, spaghetti sauce, liquor store) do not make sense in this context.
The sentence indicates that the man is tired and seeking accommodations, which suggests that he is looking for a place to sleep for the night. The options "theater" and "camp ground" do not offer sleeping accommodations, while "comfort" is too vague and could refer to anything from a comfortable bed to a cozy blanket. "Motel" is the most logical choice as it is a common type of lodging that offers rooms for overnight stays.
A notebook is often used to take notes in a learning environment such as a classroom. The other options, such as a bookstore, kitchen table, backpack, or office, may not necessarily have the same association with note-taking as a classroom does.
The sentence suggests that the lady responsible for the shift was not good at her job, and was always lacking in some way towards the needs of the seniors. The word "careless" is the closest match to that description, as it implies a lack of attention or concern for one's duties. The other options (antipathy, disinterest, negligence, and indifferent) all suggest a lack of caring, but may not necessarily be associated with someone who is responsible for caregiving.
The sentence mentions the professional team "Tigers" playing a game, which suggests that the context of the sentence is related to a baseball game. The word "professional" also suggests that the game is being played at a high level, which implies that it is likely taking place in a baseball stadium. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence indicates that the answer relates to the field of architecture. The options "table," "restaurant," and "synagogue" are not relevant to architecture, while "all buildings" is a generalization that ignores the fact that some buildings are not enclosed structures (e.g., bridges, observation towers, etc.). Therefore, the answer must be "inside," as all buildings are typically found within some sort of enclosure.
The sentence suggests that someone who is lonely may buy something for companionship. The option "girlfriend" could be a possibility, but it would not be something that "everybody" buys as it requires finding a willing partner. "Happy" and "believed" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Grow old" is not something that can be bought. A pet, such as a cat, is a common choice for someone seeking companionship, especially if they are lonely.
The question suggests that the dog is biting nearby people, which is an unsafe behavior. Using a rope or porch do not seem like effective methods to stop the dog from biting, as they do not have a direct correlation to controlling the dog's behavior. The front door and backyard also do not offer effective solutions to the problem. Using a leash, however, can help control the dog's movements and prevent it from biting nearby people.
The sentence suggests that Linda feels guilty about her actions and wants to talk to someone in order to improve her behavior. The phrase "first step" implies that talking to someone is the beginning of a process, and the most logical process that follows talking about bad behavior would be trying to change or improve that behavior. The other options, such as hurt feelings or dry mouth, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Drinking a lot of alcohol can lead to various negative consequences such as injuries (due to impaired judgment and coordination), doing stupid things (due to impaired decision-making abilities), amnesia (as a result of blackouts), hangover (due to dehydration and other physiological effects), and drunkenness (the obvious state of being heavily intoxicated). As such, all of the listed choices can be correct answers to the question.
The phrase "making grow" is a clue that the answer is related to the process of growth. This suggests that the correct answer should reflect a positive outcome that results from growth. "Die" and "aging" are both associated with negative outcomes, while "harvesting" is more closely related to the end of the growth process, rather than the result of growth itself. "Plants" is too broad a term and doesn't provide a specific outcome related to growth.
The sentence suggests that Sam had stayed awake throughout the night, which would likely leave him feeling exhausted or sleepy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - anxious would suggest he was worried or nervous, frenzied would suggest he was in a panic or frenzy, frustrated would suggest he was annoyed or irritated, and flustered would suggest he was nervous or agitated.
The sentence suggests that a person wants to do something to get a promotion at work, and the choice that is most likely to help them achieve this goal is to gain respect. This can be done by working hard, being reliable, having a positive attitude, and demonstrating competence in their job. Smiling and planting flowers may be seen as positive traits, but they are unlikely to be the primary factors that influence a promotion decision. Promising to do something is also not a reliable way to get a promotion, as it may not be feasible or may not be seen as a significant contribution to the company. Fishing in a lake is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam's beliefs and practices are traditional and strict, which is in opposition to his roommate who is described as the opposite. The word "orthodox" specifically implies adherence to established beliefs and practices, which suggests that the correct answer will be an antonym that represents a more free-thinking or unorthodox perspective. Of the given options, only "liberal" fits this description. The other options either have negative connotations (heretical, recalcitrant) or are specific to a certain religious denomination (conservadox, catholic) and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person needs supplies for a bass instrument, and the most likely place to find those supplies would be a music shop. A music shop would have a variety of strings and accessories for bass guitars, as well as other types of bass instruments commonly used in orchestral or marching band settings. A manual would not provide the necessary supplies, and the options of orchestra and marching band are not relevant to the context.
The personal telephone directory is typically used by an individual to record the contact numbers of their acquaintances, friends, or family members. Since it is a personal document, it is likely to be kept in a location that is easily accessible to the owner, such as a desk. A desk is also a common place to keep important documents and records. The other options, such as office, building, or phone booth, do not necessarily suggest a personal location where an individual would keep their personal telephone directory.
The sentence suggests that Frankie found a bone in her food, so it is most likely that the bone belongs to an animal source rather than a human source. The options "father" and "arm" are not related to food and do not make sense in the context. "Museum" is also not related to the context and is an unlikely option for a bone found in food. The option "human body" is unlikely because it would raise significant health concerns if a human bone was found in food. Therefore, the most likely option is that the bone belonged to a cow, which is a common source of meat in many dishes.
The sentence suggests that the medics were in a highly emotional and urgent state, indicating that the situation was dire. The fact that they were concerned about the patient losing consciousness implies that they were at risk of dying. The other options do not fit the context or severity of the situation described.
The word "solitary" suggests that the apple trees are growing alone or in small numbers. A valley is a low-lying area surrounded by hills or mountains and may be less favorable for planting large orchards, making it a more likely location for solitary apple trees. The other options, such as orchard and fields, imply larger areas of land dedicated to growing crops, making it less likely for apple trees to be growing alone. Pennsylvania and park are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
A doormat is usually placed at the entrance of a building or a house to help keep the inside clean. While it is possible for a patio to have a doormat, it is less common because patios are typically outside and not considered part of the interior of a building. The other options listed are all common locations where one would expect to find a doormat.
The sentence suggests that the student wanted to be left alone during finals week, which implies that they were in a private or semi-private space like a dorm room or apartment where someone might knock on the door. A "do not disturb" sign is often used in situations where someone wants privacy or is trying to focus, so it makes sense that the sign would be placed in a doorway to indicate that the student did not want to be disturbed while inside their room. None of the other options provide a clear indication of where the student might have placed the sign.
The sentence states that the small dog picked up the newspaper from the driveway, which implies that the dog had access to the outside of a house. The option "own house" is the only one that indicates a possible ownership of a property where the dog could live and perform these actions. The other options are either irrelevant or suggest different living arrangements for the dog.
The context of the sentence suggests that the day traders were on a trading floor, which is most likely located in a financial hub such as New York City. The fact that they celebrated at a steak house also indicates that they were in a city or town with access to upscale dining. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about what is important for a student's ability to learn, which suggests that the answer needs to relate to how students learn. The term "effectiveness" suggests that the answer is related to how well a student is able to learn and retain information, and how successful they are at applying what they have learned. The other options (learn more, distress, dysfunction, intelligence) do not directly relate to the process of learning or how successful a student is at it.
The question is asking for the best way to understand a theory better, which suggests that the answer should involve improving one's understanding or knowledge of the theory. Effort and time may be important factors in studying a theory, but they do not necessarily lead to better understanding on their own. Thinking may be a part of the process of understanding a theory, but it is not a complete answer. Singing is not relevant to the question. Therefore, knowledge of the theory is the best answer.
The word "crisis" suggests a situation of extreme danger or difficulty. In such circumstances, people often experience fear and anxiety, which can lead to panic. Panic is a common response to crisis situations, as it is a natural instinct to try and protect oneself from harm. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not related to crisis situations or do not reflect a common human response to crisis.
The sentence implies that there is a common place in school where students put their gum, and the word "stick" suggests that it is not a designated location. The options "books," "shelf," "water fountain," and "movies" do not make logical sense as places to put gum, while "sidewalk" is a common location where people may discard gum.
The sentence suggests that the person who was invited to the party is not comfortable in social situations. 'Stay home' is the most appropriate choice in this scenario since it implies that the person will not attend the party and avoid socializing altogether. The other options like 'meeting', 'medium', 'blowing off steam', and 'studying' have no relation with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the ECB's sole focus on fighting inflation had negative consequences, which is often associated with deflation. Deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services, which can lead to a decrease in consumer spending and investment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that children enjoy playing, which is often associated with having fun. Playing with toys and using their imagination are ways that children often have fun, while going to the movies and reading to may not be as enjoyable for some children. Therefore, the most likely answer is "have fun".
Shadows are cast when an object blocks the path of light, creating a shadow on the surface behind it. Bright light sources, such as the sun or a lamp, are often the source of the light that casts a shadow. The other options are not likely to be the source of a shadow, as a walking man or a bridge would not typically cast a significant shadow, and the ground and daytime are not sources of light themselves.
The question suggests that the high temperature is causing discomfort for the person. Discomfort can cause a person to wake up in the middle of the night and be unable to go back to sleep. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The phrase "special abilities far beyond normal ferrets" suggests that this is a fictional or fantastical ferret. Comic books often feature characters with unusual abilities or powers, making it a likely source for learning about this kind of ferret. The other options, such as being outdoors or in a specific location, do not seem relevant to learning about a unique ferret. Redwall is a book series featuring animal characters, but there is no indication that it specifically includes a ferret with exceptional abilities.
The question suggests that the small dog has trouble peeing indoors, so the correct answer would be where the dog should sleep. The options "water," "kennel," and "ASPCA" do not make sense in this context since they are not related to where the dog should sleep. "Person's home" could be a possibility, but it is too broad and not specific enough. "Basket" is the best answer since it implies a cozy space for a small dog to sleep comfortably and may be easier to clean if the dog has accidents.
Police cars are often associated with enforcing speed limits and traffic laws, which can cause other drivers to slow down when they see a police car on the road. Pitting refers to a dangerous maneuver where a police car intentionally collides with another vehicle, which is not a common behavior associated with police cars. Cost money, get to town, and move people do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking for advice on how to satisfy curiosity about another location, which can best be achieved by physically going there. The other options do not involve any sort of exploration or firsthand experience of the location. Seeing a favorite show, hearing the news, and eating lunch do not involve leaving your current location or learning more about the location you are curious about. Reading a book may provide some information, but it is not the same as experiencing the location firsthand.
Our sun is the center of our solar system, which consists of eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies that orbit around it. The other options are not accurate, as the universe is much larger than just our solar system, outer space is the vast expanse beyond our planet, a star is a celestial object like the sun, and beans have no relation to astronomy.
The sentence suggests that John hung something on his wall after returning from a trip to the west coast. The fact that it mentions a fox implies that the item hung on the wall was a representation of a fox, likely a painting or a taxidermied animal. The other choices do not align with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for inspiration for original paintings to put on their wall. Art shows are a great source of inspiration for original paintings as they showcase unique and diverse works of art by various artists. Classrooms, labyrinths, corners, and paint stores do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence and are less likely to provide inspiration for original paintings.
The sentence suggests that kids would go to a place where they could cool off if it's hot outside. A swimming pool is a common place where people go to swim and cool off on hot days. The other options, such as a lake, toy store or Disneyland, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence. A park may offer shade but doesn't necessarily provide a way to cool off on a hot day.
A heifer is a young female cow, and since she appears pleased with herself, it suggests that she may have just given birth or been recently milked. This would be more likely to occur on a dairy farm, where cows are specifically raised for their milk production. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a lecture happening and that the listener should pay attention to it. Paying attention to the lecture will enable the listener to gain knowledge or learn something from it. The other options may be related to the lecture, but they do not directly suggest what the listener should do during the lecture, unlike "learn from".
The question suggests that the act of cleaning the house will result in a particular outcome. The word "neatness" implies that cleaning the house will result in a clean and organized living space. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Order" is similar to neatness, but it does not necessarily imply cleanliness. "Tiredness" implies that cleaning the house will be physically exhausting, which is not necessarily the outcome the question is asking about. "Pass out" implies a very negative outcome, while "invigorating" implies a positive and energizing outcome, both of which are unlikely outcomes of cleaning the house.
Drinking too much alcohol can cause nausea, dizziness, and vomiting, which may explain why someone who drinks too much liquor is likely to throw up. Stumbling may also be a symptom of intoxication, but it is not a direct consequence of drinking too much liquor. Food and coffee are not related to the effects of alcohol, and choking is a more severe reaction that is not commonly associated with alcohol consumption.
Jellyfish are generally found in ocean and sea water, not in human hands, supermarkets, or stores. The Mediterranean sea is a known location where jellyfish can be found, making it the most likely choice among the options given.
A labyrinth is a maze-like structure with a series of pathways that can be confusing to navigate. It is easy to get lost in a labyrinth and end up at a dead end, which can feel like running into a wall when trying to leave. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a change that has occurred to ice, specifically one that would result in it no longer being ice. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid state, which would explain why it is no longer considered to be ice. The other options are not applicable because they do not involve a change in the state of the ice.
The sentence indicates that the man's facial injury was devastating and has affected his appearance in a negative way, leading him to believe that the woman he is looking at could never love him. The word "hideous" best describes something that is extremely ugly and unpleasant to look at. The other options do not carry the same weight of negative connotation as "hideous" and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that dogs are active and move around a lot, which requires them to have some physical ability to do so. The most obvious physical characteristic that allows dogs to move around quickly and easily is having four legs. The other options, such as pointed ears or fleas, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Running a marathon, which is approximately 26 miles, is an extremely physically demanding activity that can lead to extreme exhaustion for most people. It is not uncommon for marathon runners to feel completely drained after completing the race, as they have just exerted an enormous amount of energy. While injuries and other complications can occur during a marathon, the other answer choices (excruciating pain, bloody legs, death, and passing out) are not typical or desirable outcomes of running a marathon.
The phrase "automated ticket booth" suggests a location where tickets can be purchased without the help of a human clerk. Train stations and subways often have automated ticket booths for convenience and efficiency, whereas baby stores and auditoriums typically do not require ticket purchases. While a clerk may be present at a ticket booth, the phrase "automated" implies that the booth does not rely on human assistance. Therefore, the best answer is "subway".
A rest area is a location usually found along highways or interstates where drivers can stop to take a rest, use the restroom, and stretch their legs. Rest areas typically do not have beds available for use, making this choice the correct answer. The other options all commonly have beds available, such as in a hotel room, hospital room, or neighbor's house. A loft may or may not have a bed, but it would not be unusual to find one there.
The sentence suggests that despite being old, the bull had a lot of energy for a certain activity. The word "feeble" means weak and lacking physical strength, which contradicts the idea that the bull still had enough energy for sex. The other options, such as "charge rider" and "bullbleep," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Female" and "cow" are both incorrect because the sentence specifies that the subject of the sentence is a bull, which is a male bovine.
The question implies that the Antarctic Ocean is named after a continent, which means that we are looking for another ocean that is named after a landmass. The Atlantic and Pacific oceans are not named after specific landmasses, while the Indian Ocean is named after the landmass of India. Therefore, the correct answer is Indian Ocean. The last option is incorrect because it is a duplicate of a previous option.
Grapes are a common fruit found in food stores, supermarkets, and grocery stores. They are typically sold in large quantities, either packaged in bags or sold by weight. While grapes can be grown in a field or wine country, these locations are not typical places to purchase them directly. Lunch boxes and vending machines also do not typically offer fresh produce like grapes.
Drinking too much alcohol can lead to various negative effects on the body, including sickness, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Becoming drunk and having fun are also possible effects, but they are not necessarily negative or guaranteed to happen to everyone who drinks too much. Active and frequent urination may be a result of drinking a lot of fluids but are not directly related to the consumption of alcohol itself.
The sentence suggests that the office is in need of new computers, but upgrading them would be a challenge for some reason. The context of the sentence indicates that the issue is related to money, since the word "expensive" is a common adjective used to describe something that costs a lot. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb," "fun," and "fast" are not related to the function or cost of the computers, and "do work" is too vague to be a plausible answer.
The sentence suggests that the subject being discussed is excited babies. Although babies may not be able to make the same noise as adults when applauding, the sentence implies that they still engage in some form of clapping when excited. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
White rats are often used in laboratories for scientific experiments due to their ease of handling, breeding, and predictable behavior. They are particularly useful for studying genetics and behavior, and are often bred specifically for research purposes. The other options are unlikely places to find a white rat, as they are not natural habitats or common locations for white rats to be kept.
The question is asking about the reason for the biodiversity in the oceans, which could be influenced by various environmental factors. The phrase "so many different creatures" suggests that there is a high level of species diversity. One possible factor that could contribute to this is the depth of the ocean. The deeper parts of the ocean have unique environmental conditions such as extreme pressure, cold temperatures, and lack of light, which could provide habitats for different types of creatures. The other options do not have a clear connection to the question or the context of the oceans.
The sentence suggests that the main ingredient for the tacos needs to be cooked in a hot pan. The phrase "brown meat" is commonly used when cooking ground beef, which is a common ingredient in tacos. The other options do not match the context of the sentence as they either refer to general cooking instructions or are too broad.
The sentence implies that the person is playing an acoustic guitar while wearing headphones and sitting in a booth with a window, which suggests a soundproof recording studio setting. It is common for musicians to play while wearing headphones to listen to themselves or the other musicians they are playing with, and a soundproof booth with a window allows for visual communication while minimizing sound interference. The other options, such as a music shop or closet, do not match the context of the sentence.
The context of the question is about a student's performance in school sessions. To perform well in school sessions, a basic expectation would be to pass the courses being taken. This means achieving a satisfactory level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter. While studying history and asking questions are also important aspects of learning and becoming a successful student, they do not necessarily indicate a student's overall performance in school sessions. Similarly, "Michigan" is not relevant to the context of the question, and "better grade" is too vague to be a correct answer.
The sentence implies that the paper is no longer needed and is being thrown away. The word "crumpled" suggests that the paper will be crumpled up into a ball before being discarded. The other options do not fit the context of throwing away paper, such as "read" or "coloured." "Saturated with water" may be a possibility if the paper needs to be destroyed for confidential reasons, but it is not a common action for disposing of unwanted paper. "One dimensional" does not make sense in the context of disposing of paper.
The sentence implies that the shopping center was crowded and difficult to navigate, suggesting that there were a lot of people in the area. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for the overcrowding of the shopping center. Urban areas, suburbs, stores, and children may all be present in a shopping center, but they do not necessarily cause crowding on their own.
The sentence suggests that dogs become hot and tired, which can dehydrate them. It then implies that they do something "sloppily," which could be interpreted as a behavior that is not well-controlled or refined. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that the behavior being referenced is drinking water, which dogs may do messily or eagerly when they are thirsty. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the jellyfish being referred to is in its natural habitat and not kept in captivity. A shore is a location where jellyfish can be found in their natural habitat, typically in the ocean or other bodies of water. A store, tank, river, or movie are not typically associated with finding live jellyfish in their natural habitat.
A vacuum is a household appliance that is commonly used for cleaning floors, carpets, and other surfaces. It is typically stored in a closet or storage room when not in use. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Space and orbit refer to outer space, which is not a likely storage location for a household appliance. Dyson is a brand of vacuum, but it is not a location where a vacuum might be stored. Container is too vague and could refer to many different types of storage containers.
Stools are often found in bars as they are a common seating option at the bar counter. The other options do not have any clear association with stools.
The sentence suggests that the buffalo population suffered greatly due to hunting, which caused their numbers to become scarce. The word "endangered" indicates that the buffalo are still at risk of becoming extinct, but efforts have been made to increase their numbers. The other options imply that the buffalo are no longer in danger or that they were never in danger at all, which does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the teacher emphasized the importance of the topic by indicating that it would appear on the test. Therefore, everything the students were learning about the topic was likely very important for them to know. The other options do not reflect the gravity of the situation or the teacher's emphasis on the topic's significance.
The sentence suggests that the father is upset about the lack of justice being served, which implies that he is experiencing emotions related to sadness or disappointment. Out of the options given, anguish is the best fit for such a scenario, as it refers to severe mental or physical pain or suffering. Revenge, retaliation, and going to jail do not fit the context of the sentence, while remorse implies that the father was somehow responsible for the man's release, which is not mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that teenagers dislike going somewhere, but have a reason to attend anyway. This description fits most closely with high school, as many teenagers may not enjoy attending school but are incentivized to attend by the need to receive an education and graduate. The other options are not usually associated with being mandatory or necessary for teenagers to attend.
The question is referencing the story of Noah's Ark, in which it is said that every kind of animal was represented. The idea of having different kinds of dogs is connected to the need to have a diverse collection of animals, so that the world could be repopulated after the flood. The other options do not provide any clear explanation for why there are different kinds of dogs.
The sentence mentions that an agricultural specialist was walking from row to row, which suggests that he was likely in a location where crops were being grown. This narrows down the choices to farmer's field and vegetable garden. However, the context of the sentence suggests a larger area, so farmer's field is the more accurate choice. The other options, such as sequence of similar things or auditorium, do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking about the location of the world's most famous horse race, implying that there is a particular event that holds this distinction. Kentucky is known for its horse racing culture and hosts the Kentucky Derby, which is widely considered the most famous horse race in the world. The other options offered do not have any clear connection to horse racing or famous events.
The word "ambiguous" means unclear or having multiple possible interpretations. Therefore, the opposite of ambiguous would be something that is clear and has a single interpretation. The words "certain," "distinct," and "explicit" all suggest something that is clear and specific. The word "blurry" suggests the opposite of clear, so it is not the correct choice.
The sentence suggests that kissing is being described. Kissing is often associated with pleasure, as it can be a physically enjoyable experience. The other options may also be associated with kissing to some degree, but they do not fit as well with the idea that kissing is often pleasurable.
Monopoly is a board game where players compete to be the last one remaining in the game by accumulating as much wealth and property as possible. The game ends when one person has achieved a certain level of success, in this case, winning the game. The other options do not reflect the objective or rules of Monopoly.
The sentence implies that children are engaging in some activity while in the car, and the options provided all suggest possible activities that children can do. However, throwing things does not seem like a desirable activity and saying the alphabet is more of an educational task than a play activity. On the other hand, hearing stories, playing with toys, and playing games are all common ways for children to pass the time and stay entertained during car rides. However, since the sentence specifically asks about what children like to do, playing games seems like the most appropriate answer as it allows for creativity and interaction with others.
The question is asking for a reason to buy new cups when moving into a specific location - the city. When moving into a new apartment, it is common to purchase new kitchen supplies, including cups. The other choices do not have a clear connection to buying new cups when moving into a city.
The sentence suggests that John did not abandon his son, meaning he did not leave or neglect him. Instead, he did something else to him. Out of the given choices, "embrace" is the most appropriate, as it means to hold someone tightly and show affection or acceptance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The description suggests that James lives in a place where there are many cottages, which is a common feature of villages. Additionally, the fact that he enjoys drawing pictures of the cottages and people in the area and sharing them with others implies that it is a community where people know and interact with each other. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The question is asking for a reason why someone would stop buying products, which implies that they were previously buying products. Of the choices provided, running out of money is the most plausible reason for someone to stop buying products. Comparison shopping refers to the process of comparing prices and features of different products before making a purchase, so it doesn't necessarily lead someone to stop buying products altogether. Overstocking refers to having an excess of products, which is not related to why someone would stop buying products. Spending money and bankruptcy are related to financial difficulties, but running out of money is a more general and likely reason for someone to stop buying products.
The sentence suggests that there is a location where one can drive unrestricted on a superhighway, which is commonly associated with the autobahn in Germany. The autobahn is known for having stretches without a speed limit, allowing drivers to travel unrestricted. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Laddie's dental office is the only one in the area, which implies that it is located in a small town or a rural area. It is unlikely that Laddie would reside in the dental office or an office building, as those are not typically used as living spaces. "Main street" and "patient" are not likely options either, as they do not necessarily indicate where Laddie might live.
The other choices are all related to things a child might not want to do or might be restricted from doing, but "have sex" is not appropriate for a child to engage in and therefore can be eliminated as the correct choice.
In this context, the question is asking for a container that can hold water for the dog to drink from. A cup is a logical choice because it is a common household item that can hold liquids, and it is small enough for the dog to easily drink from. The other options (empty bottle, can, cabinet, backpack) do not provide a good solution for the dog's need to drink water.
The sentence suggests that the round piece of road was effective at slowing down traffic, while something else was not as effective at stopping traffic completely. The word "long" could indicate that the other option is a long, straight road, which may not have enough obstacles or turns to slow down traffic effectively. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that some people have a belief that providing aid to those in need can create a dependency, meaning that the individuals become reliant on the assistance and lose the ability to provide for themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is dependence. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence or convey a negative connotation.
The sentence suggests that the person was experiencing extreme hardship, which can lead to depression and thoughts of suicide. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence. "Grief" may be a natural response to difficulty in life but it does not specifically suggest an action that the person took. "Going to jail" and "not living" are not logical responses to a difficult life situation. "Writing his congressman" may be a course of action for some, but it does not address the severity of the situation described in the sentence.
The question is about finding a fun way to get in shape, but the word "disciplined" suggests that the answer may not be something that is inherently fun. A disciplined approach to fitness may involve sticking to a workout routine, eating a healthy diet, and setting achievable goals. While these activities may not be immediately enjoyable, they can result in long-term benefits and a sense of accomplishment. The other options do not have a direct connection to the idea of getting in shape. "Sitting down" and "overweight" may even hinder fitness goals, while "sex" and "feeling good" may have some health benefits but may not be reliable methods for achieving overall fitness.
The sentence suggests that the monsters in the dream are causing fear or unease, which is a common experience during a nightmare. Nightmares are often associated with scary or disturbing images and can create a sense of confusion and frightening experience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the canned vegetables need to be stored over the winter, indicating that they are to be kept long-term. The microwave and salad are not suitable storage options as they are not designed for long-term storage. The farmer's market is a place where vegetables are sold, not stored. Store is too broad and could refer to any type of storage location. The cellar is a common storage location for canned goods as it is a cool and dry space that can help preserve their shelf life.
The question is asking for the best place to get furniture from, indicating that the options should be places where furniture is sold or obtained. The option "room" is not a place where furniture can be obtained or purchased. "Warehouse" and "loft" could be places where furniture is stored or made but not necessarily where it is sold. "Rug" is only a type of furniture and not a place where it can be obtained. "Store" is the most appropriate option as it is a place where furniture is usually sold.
The fork is a common utensil used for eating food, and it is typically placed on a plate during meal times. The other options, such as video game, kitchen drawer, table, and road, have no clear connection to the context of the question and would not be a logical place for a fork to belong.
Drinking water is known to have a hydrating effect on most humans, as it helps to replenish the fluids lost through sweating, urination, and other bodily processes. This can also lead to the need to urinate more frequently, as excess fluids are excreted from the body. Swallowing is the act of ingesting food or beverages and does not necessarily refer to the effects of drinking water specifically. Sickness and runny nose are not typically associated with drinking water, unless the water is contaminated.
The use of the word "always" suggests that the answer relates to a recurring situation that the president finds themselves in, rather than a physical location. Out of the options provided, only "trouble" fits this criteria, as it implies that the president is often involved in controversy or difficulty. The other options (building, white house, board room, limousine) are all physical locations that the president may be in, but do not provide a fitting answer to the question.
A fiddle is a type of musical instrument commonly used in folk or country music. As such, it's likely that one would find it in a music store, which is a place that sells musical instruments. The other options - dance hall, orchestra, Tennessee, and rock concert - do not necessarily imply that a fiddle would be present.
The question suggests that the sloth was taken from its natural habitat or environment. Wilderness and countryside are both options that could refer to a natural setting. Encyclopedia, school, and dictionary do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the man's condition was a result of his decision to get drunk. The word "hangover" implies that he consumed a significant amount of alcohol the night before, which would have affected his ability to walk steadily or maintain his balance. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be "stagger," which means to walk unsteadily as if about to fall, and is commonly associated with the effects of alcohol consumption. The other options, such as "get arrested" or "sleep over," are not related to the context of the sentence.
The term "changing society" implies a desire for significant transformation in the way things are currently done. A cultural revolution involves changing the values, beliefs, and norms of a society, which would align with the idea of wanting a significant societal change. The other options, such as new laws, confusion and chaos, happiness for, and train, do not necessarily indicate a desire for a major societal change.
The question is asking for an illogically spelled word, which means it may have unconventional or irregular spelling. "Though" is a commonly misspelled word because of the silent "gh" at the end, and it may not follow normal English spelling patterns. The other options do not have any known spelling irregularities.
The question asks why someone would want to use a computer, and one of the choices, increased efficiency, is a benefit often associated with computer use. Computers can streamline tasks and automate processes, allowing individuals to complete work faster and with greater accuracy. The other choices, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain, are negative effects of computer use that may be avoided with proper ergonomic practices or breaks from screen time. Work and pleasure are general reasons for computer use, but they do not provide specific benefits or reasons for using a computer.
The sentence implies that the person is looking for a place to physically try out keyboard instruments before making a purchase. A music store would be the most likely option as they typically have a selection of instruments for customers to try out. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a band or orchestra may not necessarily have multiple keyboard instruments available for someone to try out, accompanying a singer may not require a keyboard specifically, and a museum likely would not have playable keyboard instruments available for visitors.
A library is a place where books are kept and people are expected to engage in activities related to reading and learning. Studies by librarianships show that libraries are quiet places where people go to read and work on their studies. Therefore, the most likely activity taking place in a library is studying books, which distinguishes it as a resourceful place for research and information gathering. The other options given in the choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are therefore not suitable answers.
Playing games is often seen as a form of entertainment and is viewed as an engaging activity that people engage in to relax and have fun. While people may enjoy playing games competitively or become excited when they win, entertainment is the most common reason people play games. Anger is generally not a desirable emotion associated with playing games, so that option can be eliminated as well.
The sentence suggests that the women were previously keeping quiet about an issue and decided to finally talk about it. This implies that they had been staying silent or sitting silently before. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to the idea of speaking up about an issue.
Mirrors are commonly found in dressing rooms or areas where people get ready, such as bedrooms or closets. The use of the word "usually" implies that this question is asking about the typical or expected location for a mirror to be long, and dressing rooms are often designed with mirrors that extend from floor to ceiling to provide a full-length reflection. The other options, such as a car or shoe store, do not typically have mirrors that are long in length.
Bald eagles are known for perching on tall trees, especially pine trees, in order to spot prey and protect their nests. While they can be found in many places, including Canada and wildlife refuges, the specific question asks where they would land, suggesting a preference for a specific type of location. Open country and on a lake are less likely choices since they are not typical perching spots for bald eagles.
The use of the word "contemplating" suggests that the student was deep in thought and considering different aspects of the problem. The phrase "that's when he made the" implies that the student did something intentional that led to the answer, indicating an active process of problem-solving. The word "reflection" fits in with this line of thinking, as it suggests a period of introspection or careful consideration that leads to a breakthrough. The other choices - action, discovery, deciding, and thinking - are all possible outcomes of reflection, but they do not fit as neatly with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the astronaut was looking for a specific location, namely, the United States, and needed a tool to help him navigate from outer space. An atlas or history book may provide information about the country's history or geography, but a map is the most specific and practical tool for locating a specific point on the Earth's surface. The option "towards ocean" is too vague and doesn't provide the necessary information to pinpoint a specific location. The northern hemisphere is a large area that encompasses many countries and doesn't provide the necessary specificity to answer the question.
The sentence suggests that Devil's food is a prize that you can win at a fundraising game that is commonly played at churches. The only option that fits this context is cakewalk, which is a popular game played at carnivals and fundraisers where players walk around a circle while music plays, and when the music stops, they must stop on a number. The number corresponds to a cake, which the winner gets to take home. The other options, such as satanism and yoke devil, do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the company's auditors are concerned about the speaker's practices, which implies that there may be some ethical or legal concerns involved. The phrase "commit crime" directly relates to this interpretation and is the most appropriate answer. The other options do not address the context of the sentence or provide a logical connection to the idea of auditors being worried about the speaker's practices.
In the context of the question, "filling a salad bowl with as much as you can eat" suggests a self-service situation where the person can take as much as they want. A buffet is a type of restaurant that typically offers self-service options and allows customers to serve themselves from a selection of dishes. The other options, such as a dishwasher or cupboard, do not make sense in the context of the question.
Ocean water is known to contain natural salt due to the various minerals and salts that dissolve into it from the earth's crust and ocean floor. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The act of imprisoning someone is commonly associated with the punishment for committing a crime, especially a serious one like murder. Incarceration refers to the act of being confined to a jail or prison, which is the punishment typically given to those found guilty of murder. The other options do not have any direct connection to the context of the question, and are not associated with the punishment for murder.
The question mentions that the producer requested the removal of a scene with "full nudity" and specifies that this was due to the restrictions of a PG-13 rating. PG-13 movies typically allow for some nudity, but it must be "non-sexual" and "brief," according to the Motion Picture Association of America. The term "partial nudity" is often used to describe the type of nudity that is allowed in a PG-13 movie, which involves brief glimpses of certain body parts but without showing everything. The other answer options do not accurately describe the type of nudity allowed in a PG-13 movie.
The sentence suggests that James was not successful in winning at chess, which caused him a great deal of emotional distress. The word "failure" also implies that James was not achieving his desired outcome. The word "frustration" accurately describes this feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment. The other options do not accurately describe the emotional experience that James may have had.
The sentence indicates that the boss has to pay the workers for their job and this usually happens at the end of the week. To pay the workers, the boss would have to sign checks, which is the only option related to paying employees. The other options, such as talking to each other, liking popcorn, disagreeing with each other, and reading a newspaper, do not have any relation to the context of the sentence.
The key information in the sentence is that the waiting room has "only some fathers". This implies that it is a waiting room specifically for a type of appointment that would typically involve mothers as well. The most likely option is a pediatrist's waiting room, as this would be a place where fathers might accompany their children for check-ups, but not necessarily their partners. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where you can find a non-living weasel, implying that it is a taxidermied specimen. The options "court room", "cherry tree", "chicken coop", and "zoo" do not typically have taxidermied animals on display, whereas a "natural history museum" often has exhibits of various animals, including taxidermied specimens.
The word "students" suggests that the answer will be related to a place where students typically spend a lot of time. The other options, such as "office" and "conference," are not typically associated with student life. "Drawing" may seem like a possible answer since pens are often used for drawing, but the context of the question implies a more everyday use. The word "backpack" might be misleading, as it suggests a physical location, but it is not a place where pens are commonly used. Therefore, "school" is the most likely answer as it is a place where students spend a lot of time and use pens frequently for taking notes, completing assignments, and other tasks.
The question is asking about an area with a high concentration of lizards. South America is known for its wide variety of lizard species and large populations, making it a likely answer choice. The garden, arctic, and New Hampshire are not known for high numbers of lizards, while Utah may have some, it is not typically considered one of the largest areas with lizards.
Accord is often used to describe when two or more people or entities are in agreement. It suggests a mutual understanding or a coming together of ideas. Harmony is also used to describe agreement or balance, but it usually refers to a pleasant combination of different elements rather than a direct agreement between individuals. Problem and text are not related to the concept of agreement, while acceptance suggests a willingness to agree or comply rather than an actual agreement.
Rocks are typically found on the surface of the earth in desert environments, as the arid conditions prevent much vegetation or other layers from covering them up. Oasis, countryside, and mountains may have some rocks, but they are not specifically associated with these geographic features. Bridges are unlikely to have rocks unless they are located near a rocky area.
The word "vapid" suggests that Sarah found the movie to be shallow or lacking substance, despite being entertaining. Therefore, it is possible that she may be more drawn to a book that has more depth and substance, leading her to appreciate it more. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A fortune typically refers to a large amount of money, which can be earned or found through various means. However, the context of the sentence implies that there is a specific place where one could "find" a fortune, rather than earning it through hard work or other means. Real estate and parks may offer opportunities for financial gain, but they do not guarantee the discovery of a fortune. A treasure chest and imagination are irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The stock market, on the other hand, is a well-known place where large sums of money can be made or lost, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that there is a distinction between a town and a township, and that townships are more common in particular locations. The word "fifty" likely refers to the fifty states of the United States, indicating that the answer choice should be a state. The other options (valley, train station, executive suites) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. While Michigan is a state, there is no indication in the sentence that it is the answer.
The sentence suggests that climbing is not something that can be achieved through sheer physical strength or muscles alone. Instead, it requires a certain set of abilities or techniques that are characterized by the word "particular." Skills are often associated with a specialized set of abilities that are necessary to perform a task. The other options, while important in their own way, do not emphasize the need for specialized abilities to climb effectively.
The sentence suggests that Sally used the leaves to add them to something that is used for disposing of organic waste. The option "compost pile" is the most logical choice as it is a common method of composting organic material such as leaves. The other options, such as trees or blower, do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "too old for this shit" implies that Jerry feels out of place or uncomfortable with something that may be more common or accepted among younger people. The mention of him being square and not doing drugs or drinking further reinforces this idea. The only choice that correlates with age is "fifties," indicating that Jerry is likely in his 50s and may not be as open to new experiences as he once was. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that someone who does good to others is likely to have a positive reputation. The word "garners" suggests that this positive quality is earned or acquired through their actions. "Admiration" is a commonly used word to describe a positive reputation or perception of someone, whereas the other options do not have a clear association with reputation or good actions.
The sentence suggests that exercise has a positive effect on stress. Stress can cause negative health effects, such as heart attacks, so that option can be eliminated. The option "busy" does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Exercise is commonly associated with good health, but the sentence specifically asks about the result of exercising when stressed, so that option can also be eliminated. Tiredness may not be the best result for someone looking to relieve stress, leaving relaxation as the most logical option.
The sentence suggests that the change in the way things are done is not popular with the public. In such a situation, it is likely that people will react with strong emotions like anger and protest, which are commonly associated with moral outrage. Going to court or trial would only happen in specific legal cases, and hurt feelings are unlikely to be the primary reaction to a larger societal change. Confusion is possible but would not necessarily lead to a strong public reaction.
The context suggests that the cards are used for entertainment and leisure, which is commonly associated with games. It is unlikely for a child to do homework with cards, and while they may play with toys or play ball, the context specifically mentions cards. Hearing stories is also not mentioned in the context and does not seem to be a common use for cards.
Footprints are typically created by people walking on surfaces such as the ground, rugs, or the surface of the earth. However, it is unlikely that anyone would leave footprints inside a chimney as it is not a surface designed for walking and is often inaccessible to humans. Therefore, the correct answer is "chimney", while the other options are more likely to show footprints.
The question refers to someone wanting to see Prague, which is a city located in Europe. Therefore, the correct answer would be to travel to Europe in order to visit Prague. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
Landfills are places where garbage is deposited and left to decompose over time. As a result, the smell of rotting garbage is a common issue for those who live near landfills. While it is possible for some materials to be composted in a landfill, the sentence suggests a negative outcome for the garbage in question. The options "container," "healthy," and "composted" do not make sense in the context of landfills or the decomposition of garbage.
The sentence suggests that starting the car had a specific effect on the attached device. "Set off" is a common phrase used to describe activating a device or triggering a mechanism, which may explain why it is the correct answer in this context. The other options do not make sense in this context or do not have any clear connection to the attached device.
The sentence suggests that Danny picked a grape out of some sort of receptacle on the table. The options "kitchen" and "painting of fruits" do not fit the context of the sentence. While a fruit basket, a fruit stand, and a bowl of fruit are all possible receptacles for fruit, the sentence specifically mentions that Danny picked a grape out of it, which suggests that the fruit was contained in a bowl with smaller pieces of fruit. Therefore, "bowl of fruit" is the most likely correct answer.
Too much alcohol consumption can lead to various negative effects, such as headaches, falling due to loss of coordination, vomiting, and general sickness or discomfort. However, it is important to note that hydration can also be an issue when drinking alcohol and can lead to dehydration.
The sentence implies that in order for customers to be respected by companies, they need to do something that is beneficial to the company. One action that is mutually beneficial is for customers to spend money, which supports the company's profitability and growth. The other options do not necessarily demonstrate the same level of support for the company's success or may have negative consequences, such as demanding satisfaction without reason or pestering on social media.
The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that is the antithesis of "deep". "Frivolous," "high," "light," and "funny" do not have an obvious antonymic relationship with "deep." However, "shallow" is a commonly used antonym for deep, particularly when referring to depth or knowledge, which gives us enough context to confidently choose this option.
Snakes are known to climb trees, so it is plausible that they could drop from a tree. Pet shops and cages are places where snakes might be kept, but it is unlikely that a snake would drop from these locations. Fields are open areas that do not provide much opportunity for snakes to climb or drop from, and a tropical forest is a general location that does not provide any specific information about where a snake might drop from.
The sentence suggests that the governments of republics typically have a certain form, which can be inferred from the choices given. The term "republic" usually refers to a form of government in which power is held by elected officials rather than a monarch or other hereditary ruler. Of the options given, democracy is the most commonly associated form of government with republics. The other options, such as dictatorship or aristocracy, are generally not associated with republics as they tend to involve the concentration of power in a single individual or group, rather than being distributed among elected representatives.
The question specifically mentions barbecue and apples, which suggests that the correct answer must be a region known for its BBQ but not for apple orchards. North Carolina is a famous location for BBQ, with various styles of pork-based barbecue served throughout the state. Although Washington State and Maine are located in the eastern United States, they are not particularly well-known for their BBQ culture. The Great Outdoors and Garden of Eden are not regions or states, so they can be eliminated as options.
The context of the sentence implies that the clock is still working, but the time is not accurate. "Wind down" suggests that the clock is mechanical and needs to be manually set by turning a knob or key. "Drop" and "stop working" are not actions that would help reset the time, while "continue ticking" and "tell time" are not actions that involve changing the time on the clock.
The word "teenagers" suggests that the answer is a place that caters to a younger crowd. The options "mall," "drive in movie," "high school," and "desert" do not seem to fit this criteria, but "nightclub" is commonly known as a place where young adults and teenagers can go to hear music and socialize.
The sentence implies that the person worked hard on fencing, which is a sport that involves the use of swords and requires a lot of dexterity. However, the sentence also suggests that the purpose of the fencing was to provide something, which in this case is likely to be protection. Fencing can be used as a form of self-defense or for other protective measures, such as fencing around a property. The option "obesity" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.

Refuse refers to waste or garbage, so it needs to be disposed of properly. The options basement, wastebasket, and garbage can are all places where refuse is temporarily stored before it is taken away for proper disposal. An incinerator is a device that burns waste, but not all places have them. A dump is a site where refuse is permanently buried and managed, making it the correct answer.
The sentence implies that Jane's quick thinking was needed to solve a problem that occurred during her flight, and the fact that she received a medal and promotion suggests that the situation was serious and potentially life-threatening. Catching on fire is a serious situation that would require quick thinking and decisive action from a pilot to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. The other options do not involve such a serious situation, and therefore are unlikely to be the cause of Jane's promotion and medal.
The phrase "off the rails" is commonly used to describe a situation where something has gone out of control or has failed. In this context, "flying off the rails" suggests that the situation or person in question is experiencing a sudden and dramatic failure or loss of control, which is most commonly associated with a train derailing or crashing. The other options do not make logical sense in this context.
The question is asking for a location where apple trees are not known to grow, so we can eliminate choices where apple trees are commonly found, such as Washington state and Wisconsin, which both have thriving apple industries. "Front yard" and "countryside" are too vague to know for sure, so we can assume they are possibilities. However, we can be certain that "concrete jungle" refers to a city or urban area, which is not a suitable environment for apple trees to grow. Therefore, the correct answer is "concrete jungle."
The sentence suggests that Billy wants to go home, but his mother is telling him to do the opposite. Out of the given choices, only "go away" accurately represents an action that is contrary to what Billy wants to do. The other options either suggest the same thing as what Billy wants to do (run away, leave, going away) or are not related to the context of the sentence (backspace).
The sentence mentions "Shark tank" and suggests that it is a popular reality show. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person had a reputation for causing trouble, but the teacher only needed to keep an eye on him when he was not behaving well. This implies that the person had a habit of good behavior, but also had moments where he acted out. The other options (being crooked, okay, calm) do not make sense in this context.
The sentence implies that John did not use any formatting techniques to indicate where one paragraph ended and another began, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The other options do not relate to formatting or written communication.
The question asks what people try to avoid, and suffering pain is a common experience that people try to prevent or alleviate. The other options do not have as much universal applicability - some people may avoid talking to others or believing in god, but these are not universal experiences. Banking money and waiting in line are also not universal experiences, as some people may actively seek out banking services or enjoy waiting in line for certain things.
The sentence suggests that the person does not believe in fate, which implies that they believe in free will and the ability of people to shape events. Therefore, the most likely answer is "control events." The other options, such as "pray" or "talk to each other," do not necessarily imply a belief in personal agency or control over outcomes. "Dress themselves" and "think creatively" are even more tangentially related to the topic at hand.
The sentence implies that jogging all day could lead to some negative consequences. While jogging is generally good for improving health and building strength, doing it all day could have negative consequences such as exhaustion and being tired. Heart attacks and shin splints are more likely to occur with an inappropriate level of activity, such as excessive jogging or jogging with improper form. Strong legs may result from jogging regularly, but the sentence specifically mentions jogging all day which could lead to fatigue rather than building strength.
The sentence suggests that when someone feels lost, they need someone who will listen and understand them. Being accepted or happy may be helpful, but the main focus is on feeling understood. The option of victory in war is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the consequences of hurting someone else, even if the perpetrator is not caught. "Jail time" is only a consequence if the person is caught and prosecuted. "Sadness" and "depression" may be experienced by the perpetrator, but the question is asking about a more general consequence that is likely to manifest regardless of the individual. "Resentment" could be a possible answer, but it is not a consequence that commonly arises in this scenario. "Bad karma" is a concept drawn from Hinduism and Buddhism that refers to the negative energy or consequences that accrue when someone performs an immoral act, regardless of whether or not it is detected or punished by society. This makes it the most likely answer to the question.
The question specifically asks about graduates who are not attending school later in life, suggesting that they have left school after completing their education. The term "dropping out" commonly refers to leaving school before completing a degree or program, and is the only choice that directly relates to this scenario. The other options (detention, stupidity, overwhelmed, much work) do not provide a logical explanation for why graduates would leave school.
Tin is not typically considered a valuable or desirable material, so it is often disposed of in landfills or junk yards. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not places where unwanted or discarded items are typically stored.
