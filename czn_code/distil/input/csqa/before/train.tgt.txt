The sentence suggests that the school had made efforts to change, but despite these efforts, they were still punished with sanctions. The word "ignore" implies that the authorities or whoever imposed the sanctions did not consider the school's efforts to be important or effective. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not convey the idea of disregarding or discounting the school's efforts.
The sentence suggests that Sammy is looking for a place where there are people. Populated areas is the only choice that directly relates to this, as it can refer to areas where there is a high concentration of people living or working. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A race track, the desert, an apartment, and a roadblock may not necessarily have a lot of people around.
The question asks where to find a choker that is not located in a jewelry box or boutique. A choker is a type of necklace worn tightly around the neck, which suggests that the correct answer is "neck." The other options are either places where one would normally find jewelry in a stored or displayed manner, or a type of container specifically designed for storing jewelry.
The sentence suggests that Google Maps and other GPS services have replaced something, which is most likely a physical object or tool that was used for navigation. The word "atlas" refers to a collection of maps or charts, often used as a reference for navigating. This makes it the most likely answer choice, since it highlights the type of resource that has been made redundant by the advent of digital mapping services. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fox was leaving the city, which is not a natural habitat for it, and entering the forest. This indicates that the fox was likely searching for a more suitable living environment, or its natural habitat. The other choices, such as pretty flowers or a storybook, do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while a hen house may be a potential target for a fox's hunting instincts but does not fit the idea of the fox looking for a habitat.
The sentence suggests that the equipment in question requires cable, which is commonly associated with devices that display audiovisual content, such as televisions. Radio Shack is a store that sells electronics products but is not a type of equipment. A substation is a part of an electrical power system and has nothing to do with entertainment equipment. Similarly, a cabinet and desk are pieces of furniture and not types of equipment that require cable.
The sentence mentions that the woman checked in a drawstring bag as her only baggage, which is typically done at airports. The other options (garbage can, military, jewelry store, safe) do not make sense in the context of checking in baggage.
The description of the forgotten leftovers being covered in mold suggests that the correct answer is a place where food is commonly stored and forgotten about. The options "carpet" and "coach" do not make sense as places to store food. "Breadbox" is a possibility, but the word "refrigerator" is specifically mentioned in one of the options, making it the most likely choice.
A blotter is a piece of paper or fabric that is used to absorb any extra ink that may have leaked or spilled from a fountain pen. It is a common tool that is used to keep the ink from smudging or smearing on the paper. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A business restaurant is likely to be located in the business sector, as it caters to professionals and executives who work in the area. The other options may be popular locations for restaurants, but they do not specifically cater to the business clientele. A restaurant in a town could attract locals and tourists, while a restaurant at a hotel may be more geared towards guests, and a restaurant in a mall may attract shoppers. Yellow pages, on the other hand, is a directory service and not a physical location.
The sentence implies that the person is shopping for groceries and has picked up grapes. Just before checking out, it is natural for a person to put their groceries in the grocery cart. The other options do not make sense in the context of grocery shopping.
The sentence suggests that the wife was doing all the work before the divorce, indicating that she may have felt resentful or bitter towards her spouse. Bitterness is a common emotion associated with feeling neglected or unappreciated in a relationship. The other options may also be associated with the end of a marriage, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Johnny is in a peaceful and relaxing environment, which is commonly associated with gardens. Gardens often have benches or other seating areas for visitors to sit and enjoy the scenery, which is consistent with the description of Johnny sitting on a bench to relax. The other options are less likely because they do not typically provide a tranquil atmosphere conducive to relaxation.
The phrase "cooling off" typically refers to a decrease in temperature or a slowing down of one's metabolism. The sentence suggests that James is cooling off too quickly, which could be dangerous if he continues to experience a significant loss of heat. "Revenge," "expansion," "relaxation," and "calm down" are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that would help to determine the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys the smells coming from a certain room in the house, which is a characteristic commonly associated with kitchens. Kitchens are often places where food is prepared and cooked, so it is likely that there would be many enticing aromas emanating from this space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The man speaking Cajun suggests a location in Louisiana, as Cajun is a dialect commonly spoken in that state. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "grill" in the sentence suggests that the correct answer is related to cooking outdoors. Of the given options, "barbeque" is the most closely associated with outdoor grilling. The other options, such as "backyard" and "neighbor's house," describe locations rather than cooking methods, while "restaurant" and "crockpot" involve cooking methods that do not typically involve grilling.
The sentence implies that the subject of the question is someone who is already experiencing illness, which rules out options like hospitals, doctors' offices, and heads. The other options are all groups of people who may be more susceptible to illness, but they do not specifically refer to someone who is already sick. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "sick person."
The sentence suggests that while shopping, one would expect to find a place to eat pizza. Pizzerias are often found in food courts in shopping malls, as well as in other locations like urban areas and neighborhoods with large Italian populations (such as Little Italy). However, none of the other options have a direct connection to the context of shopping and pizza.
The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a positive feeling after eating everything on the tasting menu. The word "satisfaction" directly aligns with this idea, as it signifies a sense of contentment or fulfillment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either imply negative feelings or are unrelated.
The sentence suggests that playing soccer for a long time has a negative effect on the body. The word "fatigue" is commonly associated with physical exhaustion after extended activity, which makes it the best choice. "Excitement" and "anger" do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not negative effects. "Hurting" is too specific and doesn't encompass all the different ways playing soccer can affect the body. "Getting tired" is similar to "fatigue" but is not as specific and does not capture the full extent of physical exhaustion.
The sentence suggests that there is a back entrance and implies that there are other options. "Front" is the most logical choice because it is the opposite of "back." "Side" is also a possible option, as it is a common location for secondary entrances. "Main" is a possibility, but it would depend on the context of the sentence and whether "main" is used to describe a specific entrance. "Anterior" and "current" do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that to share files with someone, a connection is required. The options "freeway," "radio," and "electrical circuit" don't match the context of file sharing. "Wires" could be a possible answer, but it is too vague and could refer to different types of wires. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "computer network," which is a logical connection to file sharing.
The sentence suggests that the object being described is a small vehicle that is controlled via a hand throttle and foot pedals. The fact that the object is being controlled via a hand throttle implies that it is a vehicle that moves through water, rather than land or air. The only option that fits this description is a boat. The other options, such as car, airplane, fuel system, or accelerate, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sean is fearful of being caught in a lie. The phrase "lying about the body" implies that Sean is not telling the truth about something serious, possibly even a crime. Therefore, he is likely worried about being found out and facing consequences for his actions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the term "drug kingpin" suggests that the context of the sentence is related to drug trafficking. In this context, "run errands" is likely a code for a specific task, such as collecting money from the dealers. The phrase "take money" is the only option that is directly related to the drug trade and would be a logical task for the dealers to do. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person's body had been active during the day and needed rest as a result. The word "working" is the only option related to physical activity that fits this context. The other options do not necessarily imply sustained physical activity throughout the day.
The sentence implies that there is a high demand for exotic snakes as pets, which suggests that these snakes are being sold in pet shops. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "ditch" and "outdoors" are not places where snakes would typically be sold, and "north america" is not relevant to the sentence. "Shop" could be a possible answer, but without the context of the sentence specifying what kind of shop it is, it is less likely than "pet shops" as an answer.
The sentence suggests that Joe faced legal repercussions from his action, which is commonly associated with a lawsuit. A lawsuit involves a legal complaint filed by one party against another that seeks to recover damages or enforce a legal right. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that cleaning something will prevent glare during a football game. Since football games are typically watched on a screen, the most likely option is a television. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for ways to share something one has in their head. All the provided choices are valid methods of communication that can be used to share one's thoughts and ideas with others. Writing an essay and summarizing main points are examples of written communication, while speaking information involves verbal communication. Organizing thoughts is an initial step in preparing to share information, and having information implies possessing knowledge on a specific topic.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a house that is separated from other places by a gate, which is a characteristic commonly associated with gated communities or subdivisions. These types of communities often have a centralized gate or entrance that restricts access to the area and provides a sense of security to its residents. The other options may not have the same level of privacy or security as a gated community.
The use of the word "canals" suggests that the correct answer is a city or location with a system of waterways. Also, the question narrows the options down to Southern Europe. The cities of Michigan, New York, and Bridge do not have a reputation for canals, while Amsterdam in the Netherlands is located in Northern Europe. Venice, on the other hand, is famous for its complex network of canals and is located in Southern Europe.
The question is asking about a specific step that a camper would need to take before starting to cook food. One essential step would be to light a fire, which is necessary for cooking food over an open flame or on a portable stove. The other options, such as making breakfast or going hiking, are not directly related to the act of cooking food while camping. Packing or bagging may be necessary to bring along cooking equipment and ingredients, but it is not a crucial step in the cooking process. Having a match handy is also important in order to start the fire.
Leaving a piece of paper outside can expose it to moisture, which can cause it to become saturated with water. This can affect the texture and appearance of the paper, making it wrinkled and potentially discolored. The other options are not related to the effects of being left outside.
The sentence suggests that Mark's semen had a change in consistency after his vasectomy. The word "thick" implies that his semen was previously viscous or dense, but the word "but" indicates that there has been a contrast in consistency. The word "thin" is the most appropriate choice to convey this shift in texture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a place to lay in the sun, which suggests an outdoor location with plenty of sunlight. The option "beach" is a common answer to this question, as beaches are known for their sunny weather and sandy shores, making them ideal for sunbathing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question specifically asks about the east coast of North America and seafood restaurants, which are commonly found in coastal areas. Maine, Boston, beach towns, and coastal cities all fit this description and are likely places to find seafood restaurants. The option "ocean" is not a feasible choice because it is not a specific location, but rather a general body of water.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a political leader, and the only option that aligns with that description is "government." The other options do not have any connection to being a political leader. Walmart and corporation are businesses, the white house is a building where the president lives and works, and the country is a geographic location, not an institution.
Sitting too close to a screen can cause eye strain and lead to headaches. This is because watching something up close forces the eye to work harder to focus, causing fatigue and discomfort. The other options do not have any connection to sitting too close to a screen.
The sentence suggests that a bald eagle needs a specific location in order to be safe. Bald eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, so it makes sense that they would be safest in a designated wildlife refuge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the game was advertised as free, but the child's parents ended up having to do something related to microtransactions, which usually involve paying money within the game. The word "paying" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to microtransactions. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "accidents" implies that something unexpected and unwanted has happened, potentially resulting in harm or damage. The other options - stressful, fun, illegal, and deadly - do not necessarily imply that accidents are involved. However, "dangerous" is directly related to accidents as dangerous driving behaviors, such as speeding or distracted driving, are often cited as common causes of accidents.
The question suggests that eating too much dinner has negative consequences. The options "living longer" and "illness" are not likely, as they are contradictory or too broad. "Tiredness" may be a result of overeating, but it is not specific to dinner. "Acid reflux" may also be a consequence of overeating, but it is not always associated with dinner specifically. "Stomach ache" is the most likely option as it is a common consequence of overeating at dinner.
When someone is chatting with friends, they are likely looking to connect with others and build relationships. Social bonding is a key reason for people to engage in conversations with friends. The other options may also be relevant in certain situations, but social bonding is the most common and likely motivation for chatting with friends.
The sentence suggests that James was walking on a surface that was made hot by the sunshine. This is a common occurrence on streets or pavement, especially during the summer months when the sun is at its strongest. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fox was searching for water during a drought, which is a condition commonly associated with California. California has experienced several severe droughts in recent years, so it is likely that this is where the fox was searching for water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that skiing can have a positive impact on the body, which is why a season of successful skiing may result in a healthy body. Skiing is a physical activity that can strengthen muscles and improve cardiovascular health, which may contribute to overall wellness. The other options imply negative outcomes, such as injury or discomfort, which are not necessarily associated with successful skiing.
The context of the sentence suggests that the sensor is used to measure distance and trigger an alarm when something comes too close. "Proximity" is a term that specifically refers to the state of being near or close to something, making it the most fitting option for describing this type of sensor. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the man looked at his watch while eating lunch suggests that he has somewhere to be, such as at work. The option "late for work" is the most logical answer in this context, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person showed how to do the work in a practical way, using their hands. This is commonly referred to as a hands-on demonstration. A demonstration often involves showing how to do something, rather than just telling or explaining it. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve teaching or showing how to do something.
Jumping jacks are a common exercise in military training, so it is likely that people would be doing jumping jacks on a military base. The other options (opera, water fountain, bus stop, church) do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to see people doing jumping jacks.
The sentence suggests that the bodyguard was successful in his role, which is to protect the person who hired him. Feeling safe is the primary purpose of a bodyguard, as they are hired to provide protection and security. The other options do not align with the purpose of a bodyguard or the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that making mistakes while learning a language can be uncomfortable, which will cause something negative. The word "misinterpretation" implies that the mistakes may lead to misunderstandings, which can be frustrating. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jim committed a crime that was serious enough to catch the attention of the police, which might lead to him being arrested and charged for his actions. Given the severity of his crime, it is likely that he would either be sentenced to jail or prison. Beating him up or killing him would not be a lawful response from the police. Get arrested is not a viable option, as Jim has already been arrested.
The word "fiddle" is often associated with traditional folk music and is frequently played at social gatherings like dances. Therefore, the most likely answer would be a dance hall. While a fiddle may be found in a music store or used in an orchestra or symphony, the context of the question implies a more informal setting. The mention of Tennessee may be a red herring, as it could be a state known for country and folk music, but the other options are a better fit given the context of the question.
The question is about recovering from exhaustion, which is typically caused by physical or mental fatigue. The most common and effective way to address this is by getting adequate rest, which usually involves sleeping. While meditating can help with relaxation and stress reduction, it may not be sufficient to fully recover from exhaustion. Staying in bed without sleeping may not provide the necessary restorative benefits to fully recover, and running out of steam refers to reaching a point of complete exhaustion and collapse rather than a method of recovering from it.
The sentence is asking for a realistic and practical action to earn money, which is often done through employment. Applying for a job is a logical step towards acquiring a steady source of income. Standing in line, taking care of proposals, and passing courses may or may not lead to job opportunities, but they are not direct or guaranteed paths to earning money. Playing the lottery is a form of gambling that is not a reliable or sustainable way of earning money.
The word "grumpy" implies someone who is easily irritated or in a bad mood. Headaches are a common physical symptom associated with stress and tension, which someone who is grumpy may experience. The other options do not have the same clear association with being in a bad mood.
While all of the choices may be potential effects of drug use, "damage" is the most general and inclusive answer. Drugs can cause harm to the body, brain, and overall health. "Cloud mind" and "lower I.Q." suggest more specific and immediate effects, while "cause illness" and "cause accidents" are potential consequences but not necessarily guaranteed. Therefore, "damage" is the safest and most accurate answer.
Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water like rivers and ponds to create a habitat for themselves. However, their dam-building activities can also cause problems for human-made structures, particularly those that rely on water flow, such as a millpond. The other answer options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not likely to be affected by beaver activity.
The phrase "hash things out" implies that they were trying to resolve a conflict or come to a decision. "After enough booze" suggests that they were drinking to loosen up or relax, which may have helped them to overcome any initial tension or disagreements. "Get close on a few things" indicates that they were making progress towards finding common ground. The other options are clearly negative or unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Most fungi thrive in environments that are warm, moist, and often dark. Sunlight can be harmful to fungi, as it can dry them out and cause them to die. Therefore, it makes sense that a fungus would not want to grow in an area where it is constantly exposed to sunlight. Under rocks provides a naturally shaded and damp environment where a fungus could grow undisturbed. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for fungi to grow.
The question is asking for a reason to attend school, which implies that the purpose of school is to gain knowledge or education. "Get smart" is the only answer choice that directly relates to this purpose. The other options ("boredom", "colds and flu", "taking tests", "spend time") do not provide a valid reason for attending school.
The question specifies that the state is south of Kentucky and north of Alabama, which narrows down the options to only Tennessee. The mention of people playing the fiddle suggests a musical tradition, which is commonly associated with Tennessee and its famous country music scene. The other options are not states, nor do they have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there are "figurative scars" that were caused by "making the cut," implying that the subject went through some sort of emotional or psychological trauma. Since the options refer to physical actions (such as stitching or pasting), the most appropriate answer is "heal." This makes sense because emotional or psychological scars don't physically "heal" in the same way that a cut or wound might.
The word "often" implies that the answer is something that commonly occurs when people engage in sex. Studies have shown that sex releases endorphins, which are feel-good hormones. This suggests that feeling good is a common result of sex. The other options are not necessarily always associated with sex. "Making love" is a euphemism for sex and does not describe a consequence. "Happiness" and "wonderful thing" are subjective and not supported by empirical evidence. "Cloud judgment" is not a common consequence of sex.
The sentence implies that there are people in uniform playing with a ball, which suggests that it is a sports-related activity. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hole, television, and pool table do not involve people in uniform or playing with a ball, while a sporting goods store is not a place where people typically play sports. Therefore, the correct answer is "sporting event."
The question is asking for the kind of place that could have a seafood restaurant. Seafood is typically associated with areas that have access to fresh seafood from the ocean, such as coastal cities. While New York City and Boston are both coastal cities, simply saying "city" is too broad and does not provide enough information to make an accurate guess.
The phrase "head of the branch yelling at" suggests that the person in charge is scolding someone under their authority. The word "subordinate" specifically refers to someone who is a lower-ranking member of an organization or company, which makes it the best choice among the given options. The other options, such as "owner" or "foot," do not fit the context of someone in a position of authority yelling at someone else.
The sentence suggests that the person is making continuous calls throughout the day with the hope that people will respond positively to his offer. "Respond" is a suitable choice because it indicates a reaction to what the person is offering. The other choices are not applicable to the context of the sentence - "hang up" suggests a negative reaction, "contact" suggests initiating communication rather than responding to it, "answer" suggests a positive reaction but not necessarily to an offer, and "attracting ducks" is irrelevant.
The sentence suggests that the person is already out shopping for fashion, which implies they are in a commercial area. A mall typically has multiple store options, including fashion retailers and bookshops, making it the most likely location for the person to find what they are looking for. The other options are less likely to have a bookshop within close proximity to fashion stores.
The question suggests that the medium for the advertisement is through a channel that one can access while reading news. The options television, bus, email and la ville are not directly related to reading news, whereas a web page is a common platform for news outlets to display advertisements.
The sentence implies that being good at playing tennis requires a certain level of ability or talent, which is commonly referred to as skill. While having a tennis racket, competing, playing on a tennis court, and having strong legs may all contribute to being a good tennis player, they are not the fundamental requirement like having skill.
The name "John Davis Lodge" suggests that this is a specific road with a designated name. A quick Google search reveals that the John Davis Lodge Memorial Toll Road is actually located in Connecticut. The other options do not have any connection to this specific toll road.
The sentence mentions that the man went to clown college, which strongly suggests that he has an interest in the world of circus performance. Running away with the circus is a common dream for many people who are drawn to the excitement and spectacle of the big top. The other options (carnival, surprise, spoons, party) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jamie's efforts to reduce her waist size were unsuccessful, which implies that her waist size may have increased or stayed the same. The words "augment," "dispare," "make larger," and "expand" all imply an increase in size, while "gain weight" specifically applies to the context of trying to reduce one's waist size.
The sentence suggests that James is experiencing a loss of consciousness, which is commonly associated with a coma. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. Death and loss of life would imply that James has already passed away, while peace and forgetfulness do not correspond with the fear and fright that James is expressing.
The words "aloof" and "self-important" both suggest that the person is distant and uninterested in social interaction. If someone is aloof, they are not friendly or sociable. If someone is self-important, they have an inflated sense of their own importance and may not be interested in others. Therefore, it is likely that they would feel bored when meeting people, rather than feeling stressed, nervous, or making new friends. Smiling is also unlikely, as their demeanor suggests they do not have a desire to engage with others.
The sentence implies that the person was injured while working on a location where buildings are being constructed. A construction site is an area where workers are engaged in building or repairing buildings or other structures, making it the most likely choice. The other options (factory, engine, shops) do not have the same association with building or constructing, while the option "insides of skyscraper's walls" is too specific and unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the time spent on communicating with each other impacted their ability to move forward with their project, suggesting a slowdown or hindrance in progress. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that playing with your dog will result in a certain outcome. The most logical option is "fun" because playing with your dog is typically an enjoyable and entertaining experience. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Alive" and "health" are not outcomes that would be expected from playing with a dog, and "playing dead" and "black" do not relate to the idea of playing with a dog at all.
The sentence implies that the book is currently being read, which suggests that the most likely location for it to be kept is somewhere where the reader is comfortable and relaxed, such as in bed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a closet or a library of congress would not be practical places to keep a book while it is being read, and a classroom or desk would suggest that the reader is in a more formal or academic setting.
The sentence states that the student needed to get some new pencils, which suggests that the student did not have any pencils on hand. The options classroom, backpack, and cabinet all refer to places where the student could potentially keep pencils, but none of them suggest that new pencils could be obtained from those locations. The option teacher also does not make sense, as the sentence does not indicate that the student would ask the teacher for new pencils. The best answer is store, as this is a common place to purchase new supplies such as pencils.
The sentence suggests that the woman has a strong motivation to shop beyond practical needs like necessities or budget constraints. The word "driven" implies an internal force or impulse that is guiding her behavior, which aligns with the concept of desire. The other options - money, time, credit, and spending money - do not fit as well because they are external factors that may influence shopping behavior but do not necessarily explain a strong drive to shop beyond practicality.
The question asks about a feeling associated with getting paid. Based on common experiences, getting paid is usually a positive experience that can bring satisfaction and relief. The other options, such as income tax and bill collectors, are typically negative aspects of financial transactions. The options "ocean" and "to happy" do not fit the context of the question. The option "sorrow" is unlikely to be associated with getting paid.
The sentence suggests that the fat man was not able to do simple activities, and therefore he refused to accept what was possible. The word "unable" fits this context and meaning. The other options either do not fit grammatically or do not make sense in the given context.
The question is asking where meat can last a long time, suggesting that the correct answer should be a place where meat can be stored for an extended period without going bad. The options "bakery" and "ham sandwich" are not places to store meat, so they can be eliminated. The option "butcher shop" may keep meat fresh for a short amount of time, but it is not a long-term storage solution. The options "fridge" and "freezer" are both places where meat can be stored, but the correct answer is likely "freezer" as it can preserve meat for a longer period of time than a fridge.
A cello is a common instrument found in a symphony orchestra, which is a group of musicians who play instrumental music together. A band typically refers to a group of musicians who play popular music, and while a cello could be included in a band, it is less common. The options "ocean", "music store", and "music shop" have no clear connection to the context of the question.
The choice of words "congregate" suggests that a group of bees is gathering in a specific location to collect nectar from red flowers. While bees are attracted to flowers in general, the color red is particularly appealing to them. A trash can or honey do not seem like likely places for bees to congregate with red flowers, while a bouquet of flowers could contain red flowers but not necessarily attract bees. A rose garden could potentially have red flowers, but it is not specified whether or not bees are present. A field of flowers, however, is a likely place for bees to gather and pollinate.
The question suggests that someone who gets angry after getting drunk is likely to engage in a specific behavior. While it is possible that they may experience other negative consequences like falling down or vomiting, anger specifically implies aggression or violence. Additionally, research has shown a link between alcohol use and increased aggression. The other options do not necessarily relate to anger specifically.
The sentence suggests that the teacher emphasized the importance of listening in order for students to acquire something valuable. Knowledge is a more logical answer because listening is crucial in gaining understanding and learning new information. Empathy may be gained through listening, but it is not specifically mentioned in the sentence. Anxiety and falling down do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "hear things" is too broad and does not provide any specific information.
The sentence suggests that Stanley had trouble distinguishing his dream from something else, which is commonly associated with confusing dreams with reality. The option "reality" is the most logical choice because if Stanley is having trouble telling his dream from reality, then it means that his dream was so vivid and realistic that it felt like it was actually happening. The other options either do not fit the context or do not make sense in the given sentence.
The sentence implies that the community garden was destroyed to make way for a new development or construction. Given that the other options (wasteland, ocean, desert, and flowers) do not logically fit with the idea of a community garden being demolished, the correct choice must be parking lot. This is a common reason for the destruction of public green spaces in urban areas, as developers often prioritize parking availability over community gardens or parks.
The sentence suggests that cats are doing something destructive and potentially damaging, so the correct answer would be something negative, like trouble. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence as well, as there's no indication of a dog or a garage, and "nature" is too broad and doesn't suggest any specific behavior. "Floor" is also too neutral and doesn't suggest any kind of trouble or destruction.
Losing weight can have many positive effects on the body and mind, including increased energy levels. When a person loses weight, they tend to have less strain on their joints and organs, which can lead to increased energy throughout the day. The other options are either negative (such as death) or not necessarily related to the benefits of losing weight (such as loose skin or beauty).
The word "lived" suggests that the person resided in a place, which is typically a building. The other options do not make sense in this context - a demonstration and conference are events, a garage is a type of structure not typically meant for human habitation, and living in someone's mouth is not possible.
The context of the sentence suggests that the skin was cut while the person was chopping onions. The most likely place for a skin to be cut in this situation is on the finger, as this is the body part most commonly used when chopping food with a knife. The other options do not make sense in this context - "good health" and "own family" are not relevant to the situation, while "meat" and "body" do not fit with the sentence's use of the word "skin".
The sentence suggests that the person who has been doing housework for hours may experience a negative emotional state as a result. Both boredom and anger are mentioned as being not what they might feel, which leaves stress and anxiety as possible options. Since housework is often viewed as a chore and can be physically demanding, it is reasonable to expect that it might cause stress, which is a common response to demanding or challenging situations. Anxiety, on the other hand, is less likely to be the correct answer since it is not directly mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the accountant used a calculator as part of their work, which is typically done in an office setting. The fact that the accountant kept one at home suggests that they might also do work from home or sometimes need to do calculations outside of the office. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with work in accounting.
The question is asking about something that typically happens at the end of a meal, which suggests that the correct answer is related to paying for the meal rather than serving, eating, or setting the table. The phrase "present bill" specifically refers to the action of bringing the receipt to the customer to indicate the total cost of the meal, which is a common practice in restaurants.
The question is asking for a word that describes a state of being that is not glad, unhappy, or gloomy. Out of the choices given, only depressed fits that description. Depressed is often used to describe a state of low mood, lack of motivation, and general feeling of sadness. The other options all describe negative emotions that are similar to unhappiness or gloominess.
The sentence suggests that in order to hear testimony about how spirituality changes lives, one must pay attention. The other options, such as going to church or appearing in court, do not necessarily guarantee that one will hear such testimony. Watching soap operas is unrelated to the topic of spirituality.
The sentence suggests that the person had a good sleep or rest, and woke up feeling a certain way. "Wakefulness" appears to be the best choice, as it indicates feeling alert and refreshed after resting. "Active" is a possibility but is not as definitive, as it could refer to feeling energetic or motivated to do things rather than simply feeling awake. "Hunger" and "in motion" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, and "lay down" is obviously not a feeling.
The sentence suggests that there is a famous temple located in a particular region. Based on the choices, the option most closely associated with a temple is Jerusalem, a city known for its religious significance and for being the site of several ancient temples, including the Temple Mount. The other choices (Jewish community, middle east, city, mosque) do not specifically reference a famous temple.
Bees are known to gather pollen from flowers in order to make honey. The only option that mentions flowers is "field of flowers," which is the most likely place for a bee to gather pollen. The other options do not have any clear connection to bees or their behavior.
The sentence suggests that the folding chair needs to be stored in a place where it won't be in the way or take up too much space. Since there are no large doors in the house, it is unlikely that the chair would be stored outside or in a garage. The most logical place to store the chair would be in a closet, which is a space that is designed specifically for storage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the conversation is about getting a divorce, which is a legal process that involves ending a marriage. The other choices do not have any relevance to a discussion with a lawyer about divorce. "Sisters" refers to a familial relationship, while "two people" is too vague and could refer to any type of relationship. "Marriage" and "lawyer" are relevant to the context, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question.
Geese are known for their ability to fly long distances during migration. They are also capable of flying at high altitudes and speeds, which makes flying the most likely method of transportation referenced in the question. The other options do not make sense in the context of geese traveling from place to place.
The sentence suggests that John's hands were injured as a result of punching the wall, which will make it difficult for him to hold his tools. The other options (hostility, anger, nose, fists) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the small dog was limited in its physical space but still felt as though it had a lot of space. This is a common description of how dogs feel when they are in a small, enclosed space like a basket or a crate. The other options do not convey the same sense of being enclosed or restricted in space.
Depression is a mental health condition that can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation may cause someone to feel overwhelmed, hopeless, or trapped, and they may consider ending their life as a way out of their pain. Overdosing, murder, and cyanide do not have a direct connection to depression, while sadness is a symptom of depression rather than a cause of death.
The sentence suggests that the person was unable to attend an event because they were sick and staying in bed. "Missing out" is the most appropriate choice since it implies that the person was unable to experience or enjoy the event due to their illness. The other choices may be relevant or important in other contexts, but do not fit the context of the sentence.
Lizards are often found in arid environments, such as deserts, where they can easily blend into their surroundings and surprise passersby. The other options may also have lizards, but the word "surprise" suggests that there is something unexpected about the location, which is more likely to be the case in a desert than in a forest or garden.
The sentence suggests that a group of people are gathering together to watch a sports game, and the person in question is making sure to bring plenty of food with them. The options "picnic" and "fairgrounds" do not seem like appropriate locations for watching a game, and "space shuttle" is completely unrelated. "Table" could be a possible location, but the fact that the person is bringing food with them implies that they are going to someone else's house. Therefore, "friend's house" is the most likely correct answer.
The phrase "caring heart" is often associated with empathy and compassion, which are traits commonly attributed to mammals. Mammals are animals that nurse their young and have a complex social structure that requires emotional connections between individuals. Therefore, it is likely that "all mammals" would be the correct choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to empathy or caring behavior.
The keywords "alcohol" and "fried foods" suggest that the speaker is looking for a place to eat and drink with a casual atmosphere, which is commonly associated with pubs. Pubs often serve a range of alcoholic beverages such as beer and also offer fried foods like fish and chips or chicken wings. The other options such as plane, store, and fraternity house do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the jar is likely to spoil if left out, which indicates that it requires a cool environment to maintain its freshness. The pantry and kitchen cupboard are typically warm and not suitable for preserving perishable items. The grocery store is not a proper storage option for an individual's jar. The refrigerator is the only option that provides the necessary cool environment to keep the jar from spoiling.
The sentence explicitly states that Sam went to Paris, which is in France. The fact that he ordered a blowfish at a sushi place further contextualizes the location as France, as sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that is commonly served in French restaurants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When skin is pinched in something, it will generally feel pressure due to the compression of the skin and underlying tissues. This pressure can cause discomfort or pain depending on the severity of the pinch. Feeling cold or clammy may be a result of external factors such as temperature or humidity, while feeling bumpy or itchy are unlikely sensations to arise from pinching alone.
The sentence suggests that Sally lost her kite because the string ran out or reached the end of the line. This would explain why it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the end of the line. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the man is preparing for a job interview, which typically requires a professional appearance. Grooming is an essential part of looking presentable and sending the right message to a potential employer. The other options, such as beauty and handsomeness, may not be as relevant or appropriate for a job interview setting. Tardiness is actually the opposite of what the man is trying to achieve by grooming, as it implies being late and disorganized.
The context of the sentence suggests that the scenario is related to a religious activity where people sit and listen to a speech. Synagogue is a place of worship for Jewish people, while confession is a confidential conversation between a person and a priest in Christianity. Both of them do not involve an audience sitting to listen to a religious speech. An office or an auditorium may have people sitting in chairs, but it is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is church.
Tabby cats are domesticated pets and are most commonly found in people's homes as companion animals. They are known to be affectionate and enjoy human interaction, making the home the most likely place for them to be happy. On the other hand, an alley or barn may be too dangerous or stressful for a pet cat, and a box or lap are not permanent homes.
The question specifies that the focus is on the east coast areas of Florida, which narrows down the possible locations. Denmark and California are not on the east coast of the United States, while "map" is not a geographical location. Therefore, the correct answer is the United States, which is where Florida is located on the east coast.
The sentence suggests that in order to work efficiently, a person must have the right tools. This implies that without the right tools, a person may struggle to complete tasks effectively. The other options, such as persistence or becoming knowledgeable, may be helpful traits or activities, but they do not directly relate to the need for tools to work efficiently.
The question is asking for a specific type of platform found in the ocean, which rules out options like launch pad, circus, and space station, which are not typically found in the ocean. The option of "large open area" is too broad, and could describe any number of things found in the ocean. The correct answer is aircraft carrier, which is a type of ship designed to launch and recover military aircraft.
The sentence suggests that the speaker expected to find potatoes in a container or bag, but instead found a snake. The only option that fits this description is "burlap sack," which is commonly used to store and transport potatoes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that listening to music can have multiple positive effects on a person's emotional state. Research has shown that listening to music can increase dopamine levels in the brain, which can lead to feelings of happiness and pleasure. Music can also trigger the release of oxytocin, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress. Furthermore, music can stimulate the facial muscles, leading to smiles and positive facial expressions. Finally, music is often used as a form of entertainment, which can provide a sense of enjoyment and distraction from daily stressors.
The phrase "make a big splash in a river with a rock" suggests that the goal is to create a significant impact in the water. A bridge is a good option for throwing a rock because it provides a height advantage, allowing you to throw the rock from a higher position and generate more force upon impact. The other options, such as mountains, countryside, or the surface of the earth, do not offer the necessary height advantage to create a big splash in a river.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath or giving false information in a court of law. This is a serious criminal offense and can result in sentencing to prison or jail time. The other options may also apply, but do not directly address the legal consequences of committing perjury in a court of law.
The sentence indicates that the new play was highly popular and well-received by the crowds, which is commonly expressed through applause. Applause is a sign of approval and appreciation for a performance, and is often used to indicate a successful and entertaining show. None of the other options are commonly associated with a successful performance, and do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence includes numerical information and asks for the solution to a mathematical equation, indicating that this is a math problem. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to involve numbers or equations.
Supermarkets are common places where people go to shop and buy food. They are often large stores that stock a wide variety of food items, making it a likely place for people to find food. The other options, such as opera, conference, building, and apartment, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely choices for the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the kid is doing something with a friend before going to play, which implies that they are making plans or coordinating their activity. Out of the choices given, only "meet" fits this context. "Laugh" and "being entertained" suggest that they are already playing or hanging out, while "math" has no clear relevance to the situation. "Sit" could be a possibility, but it doesn't capture the idea of actively preparing to go out and have fun.
The question is asking for a term that describes someone who has obtained a good education. "Illiterate" means the opposite of being educated and would not be the correct choice. "Own house," "have enough food," and "meet expectations" are irrelevant to the question and do not relate to educational attainment. Therefore, "knowledgable" is the appropriate choice as it directly relates to one's level of education.
The sentence suggests that Ben's mistake was significant enough to require him to spend 8 years somewhere as punishment. Given that he was described as an alcoholic, it's likely that his mistake involved drinking and driving, which is a serious offense that can result in a lengthy prison sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not seem like appropriate places for someone who committed a serious crime.
A ticket booth for games is commonly found at an amusement park. Train stations, cathedrals, metro stations, and fairgrounds do not typically have such booths as they are not necessarily associated with games or entertainment.
The sentence suggests that the soccer field is not located inside a building, which would rule out options such as playground, mexico, and town, which do not specify the location of the field. The option world cup refers to a specific tournament, rather than a location. Therefore, the correct answer is outside, indicating that the field is located in an open-air setting.
The sentence implies that the method of delivery being described involves physically bringing letters to their intended recipients. Therefore, options such as "mail box" and "post office" are not correct, as these refer to places where letters are dropped off or picked up, rather than delivered directly to the recipient. "Suitcase" and "bowl" are also unlikely options, as they are not commonly used for delivering letters. "Front door" is a logical choice, as it is where most deliveries, including letters, are typically made.
The sentence suggests that Sam does not like having others around him and prefers to be alone. The most fitting choice would be solitude, which refers to being alone in a calm and peaceful manner. The other options, such as abbreviation and you, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. Loneliness is related to being alone, but it has a negative connotation, which does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question likes cool temperatures, and may therefore use electric fans to keep their environment cool. The most likely places for them to have more than one fan would be at home or in a hot room. The hardware store and office options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest a personal preference for cool temperatures.
The sentence suggests that the person who is skydiving is becoming unconscious. This could be due to fear or some other reason. The options "injury" and "death" are unlikely because the person is still falling through the air, and there is no evidence of physical harm. "Playing uno" is unrelated and a non sequitur. "Falling down" is incorrect because the person is already falling, and this option does not explain how the person could become unconscious. "Coma" is the best option because it suggests that the person may have some medical or psychological issue that is causing them to become unconscious while skydiving.
The context suggests that the question is asking for a general term for seeing something through an eyepiece, which can apply to a range of devices such as cameras, binoculars, and telescopes. The other choices are more specific and do not necessarily apply to all instances of seeing something through an eyepiece. "Sights" is the most general option that fits the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the decorations are meant to be scary, and that the person responsible for them did a good job. The word "horrible" has a negative connotation and can be used to describe something that is frightening or awful, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions performing well on a test, which is usually a graded assignment in a school setting. The term "school grade" is commonly used to refer to the letter grade that a student receives on an assignment or for their overall performance in a class. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to test performance or grading.
The sentence suggests that if you tell your boss that you are bored, they will tell you to do something which implies that they want you to be productive. The option "work" fits this context the best because it is the opposite of being bored and is associated with being productive in a job environment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Jogging is a physical exercise that has numerous health benefits, such as improving cardiovascular fitness, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting weight loss. Insect repellent is not a result of jogging, while heart attacks and shin splints are negative effects that can occur if one does not exercise safely or appropriately. Being tired is a common feeling after exercising, but it is not necessarily a desirable result. Therefore, improved health is the correct answer.
Nailing is a common method of attaching something to a piece of wood by driving a nail through the material being attached and into the wood. This is a common woodworking technique that is used for furniture, construction, and many other applications. Carving involves removing material from the wood to create a specific shape or design, polishing involves making the wood smooth and shiny, petrification involves turning the wood into stone, and eating cake has nothing to do with woodworking. Therefore, nailed is the correct answer.
Foxes are often found in areas with vegetation and cover, such as grassy fields or forests. Tennessee and England are specific locations and do not provide any contextual clues about where a fox is likely to be caught. An inside joke is not a location at all.
The phrase "new dining table" suggests that the question is asking about a piece of furniture typically used for eating meals. The word "formal" in front of "dining room" implies that the space in question is specifically designated for formal events, such as dinner parties or holiday gatherings, which makes it the most appropriate location for a new dining table. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that fighting inflation might not be necessary or effective because it is not significant. The phrase "so negligible" indicates that inflation is not noticeable or important in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the idea of inflation being insignificant or not noticeable.
The question asks about something that is likely to have more than one level in a city, which suggests that the answer is related to the construction of buildings. A carpenter's shop, garage, and video game are all unlikely to have multiple floors, while the total number is not a thing that can have levels. Therefore, building is the most logical option as buildings commonly have multiple levels, particularly in urban areas where space is limited.
Hospitals are places that prioritize safety and have strict regulations regarding the prevention and management of emergencies. Given the high risks associated with hospitals, they are required to have fire extinguishers in many locations throughout the facility to ensure that the staff can respond to fires quickly and effectively. The other options do not have the same level of potential risk or regulations that would require many fire extinguishers.
The question suggests that the focus is on how someone can learn to play an upright piano. Learning to play piano often involves guided instruction which can be obtained through a music class although the other options may also provide access to an upright piano. A music room or house may have an upright piano but may not necessarily provide instruction. A music store may sell upright pianos but not necessarily offer lessons. "Medium" does not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking about what is necessary for someone to learn by themselves. Of the choices given, exposure, study, and thought may all be helpful in the learning process, but cooperation suggests that the person is not learning alone. Patience, on the other hand, is important because learning by oneself can be a slow process that requires persistence and endurance.
The sentence indicates that John and Jane wanted to be together for a longer time, which suggests that they were considering a long-term commitment. The most common long-term commitment in a romantic relationship is marriage, so it makes sense that they would plan to marry. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the couple's desire for a long-term commitment.
Getting paid usually results in a positive emotion such as happiness because it provides financial security and the ability to afford things that may bring joy, such as entertainment, travel, or hobbies. The other options are not commonly associated with getting paid. Sorrow is unlikely as getting paid is usually seen as a positive thing. Paying bills and frustration are associated with financial responsibility and management, but they do not describe the emotional response to getting paid specifically. Spending money is a consequence of getting paid, but it is not the emotion itself.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is likely going into a market to buy something. The option "food" makes the most sense as the purpose of a market is usually to sell food and other goods. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Stress" and "spending money" may be related to going to a market, but they are not as directly connected as the option "food." "That you" and "walking" are not relevant to the question.
Thin glass is often more fragile than thicker glass and therefore more likely to break easily. Its thinness makes it more vulnerable to pressure and impact, increasing the likelihood of cracks or breaks. The other options do not describe the characteristic of thin glass.
The sentence suggests that there is a consequence for not moving your car during a required time, and the most common consequence for this is getting a parking ticket. Towed and accidents are possible consequences, but they are not a direct result of not moving the car. Driving and getting tired are not consequences of not moving the car at all.
The sentence provides specific details about Bob running from a corner store to his home, indicating that he ran along a specific path. The option "city block" best describes a specific area of a town or city and would be most likely to refer to the distance that Bob ran. The other options do not accurately describe a specific area or distance. "Bed of nails" and "attractive consistent look" are unrelated to the context of the sentence, and "ground" is too broad to accurately describe a specific path.
The phrase "unpleasing fashion" suggests that the sound of the bassoon is not pleasant to hear in this context. High school bands are often known for being less experienced and polished than professional orchestras and symphonies, which may lead to a less pleasing sound. The other options, such as orchestra and symphony, are typically groups that consist of professional musicians who are skilled in playing their instruments with a pleasing sound. The phrase "baritone woodwind sound" is not specific enough to provide a clear answer, and "play music" is too broad and vague to be a relevant option.
The sentence explicitly states that John is competitive and loved competing. This implies that he enjoyed comparing himself to others and determining who was better than whom. The phrase "divide people into categories" suggests that John liked to categorize people based on their performance in competitions. The options "perform better", "might win", "losses", and "enemies" do not fit the context of the sentence as closely as "winners and losers".
The sentence suggests that the game was on sale, indicating that it was previously more expensive than its current price. The phrase "overpriced" implies that the original price was too high, which is why the game was discounted. The other options do not provide a reason for why the game was on sale or why the speaker decided to buy it at that time.
The sentence suggests that the building is large but poorly constructed, which implies that it may not be sturdy or well-built. The word "massive" suggests that the building has a significant size or weight, which makes "massless" a poor choice. "Dwarf" and "inconsequential" both suggest that the building is small or unimportant, which contradicts the fact that the building is described as "massive." "Good" is not an option because the sentence explicitly states that the building is not constructed well. Therefore, "insubstantial" is the most appropriate option as it implies that the building is not solid or substantial due to poor construction.
While a printer can be used in a variety of settings, the option that best fits the description of being used by thousands of people is a print shop. Print shops are businesses that specialize in printing services and typically handle large volumes of printing tasks for a diverse range of clients. Schools and home offices may have printers, but they likely do not serve thousands of people. A people store is not a commonly used term, and a newspaper office may have a printer, but its use would likely be limited to employees.
The question asks for a factor that could prevent someone from buying Christmas presents, indicating that there is a financial limitation. "Lack of money" is a common barrier to purchasing gifts, especially during holidays when people tend to spend more. The other answer choices do not relate to the concept of financial constraints and therefore are not correct in the context of the question.
The question asks what the hope is of playing sports without competition. "Having fun" is a key phrase that indicates that engaging in sports without competition should be an enjoyable experience. Running, balls touching, winning, and getting tired may all be related to sports, but do not specifically address the enjoyment or lack of competition.
The sentence suggests that the reason for the move was to have a master bedroom, which is a feature commonly found in larger and more spacious homes. However, the use of the phrase "moved out of the city" suggests that they were looking for a suburban home rather than a large or old house, which could be located in various areas. The option "keeping personal objects" is not related to the context of the sentence.
The word "line" is commonly associated with graphs, as they often include lines or curves to represent data trends. The other options do not have a clear connection to adding a line. A bus stop typically already has lines marking where people should stand, and adding another line would not be necessary. A post office would not typically require adding a line unless it was for some specific purpose. Adding a line to grass or a play activity does not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that Joe bought a ficus, which is typically a type of indoor houseplant. Since the other options do not correspond to indoor areas of a home, it is reasonable to assume that Joe intended to place the ficus in a room within his house. The term "family room" is often used to refer to a casual living space within a home, where people gather to watch television or spend time together. Therefore, it is the most appropriate choice.
The sentence mentions an inkwell, which suggests that there was a writing surface nearby. The most likely piece of furniture to have a writing surface is a desk. The other options do not have any clear connection to writing or ink spills.
The question suggests that the reason people continue talking when they discover something new while chatting with friends is because they are interested in learning more about the topic. This is a common motivation for discussing new information with others, as it allows individuals to deepen their understanding of the subject and gain new insights. The other options, such as agreement, discomfort, and misunderstanding, do not provide a clear explanation for why people would continue talking in this scenario. To fill their time may be a motivation for some people, but it is not specifically related to the context of discovering new information while chatting with friends.
The question asks specifically how learning about science can affect one's views, suggesting that the answer will likely involve a change in perspective or understanding. The option "increased knowledge" is a possible answer, but it does not reflect a specific change in view. "Appreciation of nature" may be a potential outcome of learning about science, but it does not fully capture the range of possible changes in perspective. "Become educated" and "excitement" may indeed result from learning about science, but they do not address the question of how one's views may change. "See things differently" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how learning about science can alter one's outlook or understanding of the world.
The sentence indicates that traveling underwater is risky due to low visibility, which can lead to a specific danger: disorientation. Disorientation can occur when a person loses their sense of direction or becomes confused about where they are. This is particularly dangerous when diving because it can lead to getting lost or running out of air. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
An intersection is where two or more roads meet, and people can stand at different locations depending on their purpose. However, the most common place for pedestrians to stand at an intersection is on the street corner or sidewalk. This is because it offers a safe place to wait for the traffic to clear, and it also provides a view of the traffic flow from all directions. The other options, such as cars or at a red light, are not typical places for pedestrians to stand at an intersection.
The sentence suggests that Janet is aware that she is dying from her injuries and is experiencing symptoms that indicate this. The option "stop breathing" is a common symptom of death, as the body's respiratory system shuts down. The other options may be indicative of other conditions or symptoms, but they do not necessarily indicate that Janet is dying.
The sentence suggests that traffic on an expressway can vary based on certain factors. Since the answer choices are all location-related, it can be assumed that the factor affecting traffic is the proximity to a certain location. The most likely answer is an American city, as expressways are commonly found in urban areas and experience higher levels of traffic as you approach the city center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the location with the highest number of telephone booths. The options given are gas stations, city, London, train station, and airport. Gas stations are unlikely to have many telephone booths as people tend to use their cell phones for emergencies. London may have a large number of telephone booths, but it is unclear if it has more than other options. Train stations and airports may have telephone booths, but their numbers may be limited. Therefore, the best answer is city, as cities typically have more telephone booths scattered throughout their streets and public areas.
The sentence indicates that John moved away from his family for a job, and even though he needed the job, he was a bit upset about the move. This implies that he would have preferred a job that was closer to his family so he would not have to move away. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Alexa needs to switch from an electric guitar to an acoustic guitar to avoid disturbing her housemate James while he works. To find an acoustic guitar, she would be best served by going to a music shop, which stocks a variety of guitars and other musical instruments for sale. The other options (house, storage, closet) are unlikely to yield any new guitars and the studio may or may not have guitars for sale.
The question is asking what can happen when someone is feeling happy. Out of the given choices, "smiles" is the most appropriate as it is a common physical expression of happiness. The other options could potentially be associated with happiness in some contexts, but they do not directly answer the question as asked. For example, "love" could be a source of happiness for some people, but it does not necessarily cause someone feeling happiness to fall into it.
When someone is leaving, it's common and polite to wave goodbye. This is a non-verbal way of saying farewell and indicating that the interaction is coming to an end. The other options are either inappropriate or not relevant to the situation of someone leaving.
The context of the sentence implies that the chef is working in the evening, which is a common time for people to eat dinner. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the chef is cooking dinner. The other options may be things a chef does in general, but they do not specifically relate to working in the evening.
The question is asking about the emotional reaction a person may have if their money is stolen. Feeling angry is a common response to being robbed, as it is a violation of one's personal space and belongings. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or offer any plausible consequences of having one's money stolen.
The sentence suggests that the people in class were asked to come up with ideas, which requires using their minds in a creative way to generate new and innovative solutions. Brainstorming is a common technique used in group settings to encourage free-flowing ideas without judgment or evaluation. The other options do not relate to the concept of coming up with new ideas or brainstorming.
The sentence suggests that someone who doesn't have immortality will eventually experience death, which is a characteristic commonly associated with mortality. Mortal refers to anything that is subject to death, decay, or destruction, whereas the other options all directly refer to the act or state of dying. Therefore, mortal is the best fit for the sentence as it describes the overarching quality of the subject rather than a specific moment in time.
The sentence implies that the protagonist's mother was unhappy with his report card, and so he knew he would be doing housework as a result. The only answer that suggests a possible solution to this problem is "getting good grades," as this would make the mother happy and potentially alleviate the need for housework. The other options do not offer any clear way to prevent the punishment.
The sentence suggests that the glass being referred to is not extra strong, which implies that it is not as durable or resistant to damage as treated glass. Fragile is a word commonly used to describe objects that are easily broken or damaged, making it the most likely choice. Weak and forceless do not accurately describe the nature of glass, while regular and flimsy do not convey the level of potential harm or susceptibility to damage implied by the word "treated."
The phrase "thrown a rod" is commonly used to describe a serious mechanical failure in a car's engine. This happens when a connecting rod breaks or detaches from the crankshaft, causing significant damage to the engine. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the phrase.
The question asks about a mode of transportation that "most people" use, and "own cars" is the most common form of transportation for the majority of people. The other options are not as commonly used for transportation. A helicopter is a luxury form of transportation and not accessible to most people. Speaking words, believing in God, and dancing together are not modes of transportation but rather abilities, beliefs, and activities.
Families often share last names or are given similar first names within the family. The other options are characteristics that are not necessarily shared by all members of a family.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to collect items to sell at a roadside stand, and that this place does not have any grass. A rest area is a common location along highways where travelers can stop to rest and use facilities, and they often have large areas with pavement or gravel that would not have grass. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - a supermarket would not be a place to collect items to sell at a roadside stand, a state park and a garden are unlikely to have areas with no grass, and the surface of the earth is too broad and vague to be a useful option.
The sentence suggests that the context is about kids finding fish in their backyards, which is more likely to be a pond rather than a boat or ocean. The option "end of line" is also unlikely to be the correct answer because it does not make sense in the context of fish and backyards. The option "ocean" is repeated twice, which shows that it is likely a mistake or a distraction.
White shoes are often associated with formal occasions such as weddings. Tennis shoes are usually designed for athletic activities and not usually white. Closet and left foot are irrelevant and house shoes are often comfortable, casual shoes that are not typically white.
The sentence suggests that James wanted to add a personal touch to the cards he chose, which would be achieved through writing them by hand. The option "handwriting" and "hand written" both suggest the act of physically writing the cards. The options "cursive writing" and "store bought" do not convey the same level of personalization as writing the cards by hand, and "online media" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the weather was checked one more time suggests that the travelers were concerned about its condition. Since they are on their way to paradise, they would want the weather to change quickly if it is unfavorable so that they can enjoy their trip without any interruption. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the purpose or goal of talking to someone. The options "hurt feelings" and "dry mouth" are not commonly associated with the act of speaking to someone, while "intimacy" is too specific and may not always be the goal of a conversation. "Changing behavior" may be a desired outcome, but it is not the main purpose of communication. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "communicating with others," which is the basic function of talking to someone.
A hairpin is a commonly used tool for styling hair, particularly for women's hairstyles. It is typically used by professional hairstylists in places such as hair salons or beauty parlors. The other options, such as "hair of woman" or "woman's hair" are not likely places of work, while a pincushion is a sewing tool and a barber shop typically specializes in men's haircuts.
The context of the question is a football field, which is typically where players compete in the sport. The other options, such as a specific state or university, a college campus, or a yard, do not have a direct connection to the context of a football field.
The phrase "master of their craft" suggests that the person is highly skilled and knowledgeable about a particular skill or trade. The verb "learn" is the most fitting of the options given, as it implies that the person has gained knowledge and skill in their craft over time. The other options, such as "drill" or "committed murder most vile," do not make sense in the context of someone being an expert in their chosen profession.
The sentence implies that watching television without accomplishing anything is a negative consequence. "Wasted time" is a commonly used phrase to describe an unproductive use of time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Getting/get fat" may be a result of watching too much television if it interferes with exercise or healthy eating habits, but it is not directly stated in the sentence. "Typing words" is not related to the activity of watching television. "Falling asleep" may occur while watching television, but it is not a consequence of accomplishing nothing.
The sentence states that the man was in a cabin in the woods and saw a fox through the window. The fox is most likely to have been outside, as it is a wild animal that lives in natural habitats such as forests and meadows. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no mention of a location like Indiana or England, a wall or a picture.
The sentence suggests that the hippy was seeking peace and harmony with all humans, which implies that they had positive emotions and sentiments towards people. "Feelings" is the most appropriate answer choice, as it directly relates to the concept of emotions towards other individuals. The other options ("names", "words", "naval", "bladders") are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not help in choosing the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the engineer was skilled overall, but had difficulty with the details of his calculations. The word "sharp" implies intelligence and competence, but the phrase "when it came to the details" suggests a specific weakness. The word "inaccurate" indicates that the engineer made mistakes in his calculations, which is a common problem when details are overlooked or not given sufficient attention. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "in the middle of the day" suggests that the person is likely to take a break from their activities to eat a meal. The options "cook dinner" and "make bread" are unlikely, as these activities typically take more time and are associated with preparing meals later in the day. "Eating in a restaurant" is a possibility, but the phrase "because of being hungry" suggests that the person is looking for a quick and easy meal, which is more likely to be found at home or in a casual dining setting. "Having lunch" is the most appropriate choice as it fits both the context and the expectation that someone would eat a meal in the middle of the day.
The sentence suggests that John is an academic person who enjoys learning and studying. This is evidenced by his desire to spend more time at the museum in order to learn more about the exhibits. The other options are not consistent with John's character or interests.
The word "embarrassing" implies that the situation is one that would cause discomfort or shame. Telling many people about such a situation is likely to result in the situation becoming more widely known, which is what the word "notoriety" suggests. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the electric motor is used in a household item that is present in almost every house. Among the given choices, the only household item which is commonly present in almost every house and uses an electric motor is an electric refrigerator. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence at all.
Peanut butter comes in a variety of packaging types, but generally, it is either stored in a jar or a plastic container. These options provide a tight seal that can preserve the freshness of the product and protect it from oxidation. Supermarkets are primarily places where peanut butter can be purchased, not stored. A pantry or sandwich are places where peanut butter can be consumed, not stored.
Board games are typically played in a comfortable and familiar setting, and "home" is the most likely location. The other options ("toy store," "school," "toy shop," and "shelf") are unlikely because they are not commonly used for playing board games with family.
The sentence suggests that James needs a garage for a specific purpose, and the other options do not fit the context as well. While it's possible that James spent a lot of money on a bike or tool storage, the fact that he needs a garage implies that he needs space to store something larger or more valuable. Additionally, the mention of "spending a lot of money" suggests that the item in question is likely to be expensive, like a car.
The sentence suggests that the person referred to in the question has a unique ability that differentiates them from other things or beings. Among the choices given, only standing upright can be considered a unique ability that only a person possesses. The other options are either common to many other things (crossing the street) or can be learned by anyone (speaking Spanish or Chinese, furthering education).
The question suggests that the friends were looking for a quiet activity to do together, which makes a movie a likely option. Going to a wedding or a restaurant can be noisy and crowded, while going to a friend's house or an internet cafe may not necessarily be a quiet activity. Therefore, the best answer is likely "movie."
The sentence indicates that the animal is tired, which is commonly associated with the need for rest or sleep. It is unlikely that a tired animal would bite, and keeping alive and needing to eat are basic functions that are unrelated to the animal's state of exhaustion. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely to be "go to sleep" or "lie down" because they are actions that an animal would typically take if it is tired.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to watching four-legged animals complete, which is likely a reference to horse races or dog races. In this case, the most appropriate location to watch this activity is at a race track. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar and can also be found on the nearby Comoros Islands. Therefore, it would be unlikely to find a lemur in Russia, a hole, a field or heaven. The only option that makes sense is that a lemur would be found at home, which would be their natural habitat in Madagascar.
The sentence suggests that John needed to go somewhere to obtain more pencils. The options "desk drawer," "cup," and "pencil case" are locations where John may have kept pencils, but it is unlikely he would need to go anywhere to obtain more. "Shelf" is too vague to determine if it is a location for pencils or a possible store. "Office Depot" is a store that sells office supplies, including pencils, so it is the most logical choice for where John went to get more pencils.
The only choice in the list that involves making a piece of wood reflective is polishing. Burning, carving, composting, and nailing all involve altering the wood in ways that would not create a reflective surface. Therefore, the correct answer must be "polished."
The sentence suggests that the people in question are expressing themselves, which indicates that they are conveying some kind of message or emotion through their actions. The fact that they trip and break their leg in front of a crowd suggests that their message or emotion is related to that situation. Suffering and pain could be possible emotions in this scenario, but the phrase "people expressing themselves" doesn't strongly suggest those emotions specifically. Laughter seems unlikely, given that breaking a leg is a serious and painful injury. Embarrassment, on the other hand, makes sense given the social awkwardness and potential humiliation of stumbling and falling in public.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is waiting for their friend at a public location, specifically a fitness center with a squash court. The other options, such as a country club or rich person's house, imply a location that would not be open to the public or would not have a squash court readily available. A pool or park may be public locations, but they do not have a clear connection to squash or waiting for someone at a specific spot.
The phrasing of the question suggests that the answer has to do with edible plants, and "vegetable" is a common category of plants that are grown specifically for food. The other options do not fit this category - "flower" and "flower petals" are not typically eaten, and "animal" and "alive" are not plants at all.
Basketball courts can be found in a variety of locations, including gyms, schools, and outdoor spaces like parks. However, the question specifically asks for a location that is likely to be outdoors. Parks are a common location for outdoor basketball courts, as they provide ample open space for the court and allow for easy public access. The other options do not necessarily indicate an outdoor location.
A balalaika is a musical instrument traditionally used in Russian folk music. It is unlikely that an artist would have any use for it, and it would not be found in a junkyard. While it could be used in singing or in an orchestra, a music store would be the most likely place to buy or rent a balalaika.

The sentence mentions a governor's office, which is typically associated with a state government. Four out of the five choices are states, but the question specifies that the city name is "popular," implying that it is a commonly known city. Mississippi is likely the correct answer as it is a well-known state with a capital city named Jackson that houses the governor's office. The other state options may have cities named Jackson, but they are not typically associated with a prominent governor's office.
A microphone boom is a type of stand used to hold a microphone in place during recording or performance. It is commonly used in a recording studio where an artist or band would record an album. A radio station or TV studio might also use a microphone boom, but they are more likely to use stationary microphones instead. A concert setting could also use a microphone boom, but it wouldn't be used specifically for recording an album, as live performances are usually recorded with multiple stationary microphones. New York is not relevant to the context and does not provide any useful information for answering the question.
The sentence implies that the injury being referred to can have serious and potentially fatal consequences. Cause death is the most extreme and severe outcome of an injury. Bleeding, falling down, becoming infected, and claiming insurance are all possible consequences of an injury, but they are not necessarily the worst outcome.
The sentence suggests that the person has a strong emotional connection to their TV, which implies that they would also have a strong attachment to the tool that allows them to control it - the remote. "Attached" best describes this emotional connection, whereas "nostalgic" and "companionable" don't make sense in this context. "Likely" and "close" are vague and don't offer any insight into the person's feelings towards their remote.
The sentence suggests that the man wanted to take a bus but was unable to because all the seats were taken up by people who were "doing" something. The only option among the choices that fits this context is "sitting down." The other options do not relate to what people may be doing on a bus such as "refusing" or "going outdoors." "Save money" is also not likely to be a reason why all the seats on a bus are full.
The sentence suggests that Bob had undervalued his Pokemon cards, but that he was mistaken. The word "common" implies that Bob believed the cards were not special or unique, but the phrase "but he was wrong about them" implies that they were actually in some way exceptional. The word "rare" means something that is not common or is unusual, which fits with the idea that Bob's cards were more valuable than he had believed. The other options do not strongly suggest that the cards were more valuable than Bob had assumed.
The sentence suggests that the husband's marriage is coming to an end, which is typically associated with feelings of sadness and mourning. The word "even" suggests that the husband's emotions may be complex and not focused solely on his relationship with his wife. The other options, such as happiness and pleasure, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not likely to be appropriate emotional responses to the end of a marriage. Isolation may be a possible secondary emotion, but it is not the primary emotion suggested in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the camper was overwhelmed by the vastness of the night sky, which made him feel small and powerless in comparison. "Insignificant" is a word often used to describe feelings of smallness or lack of importance, whereas the other options do not fit the context as well. "Stellar" could be a possibility, but it is not the best fit given the tone of the sentence.
The question suggests that the location mentioned is close to the USA but is still considered an imported product. The only option that fits this description is Canada, as it shares a border with the USA and is a commonly imported source of apples. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the old man did the crossword puzzle every morning as a routine, suggesting that it was a leisure activity he enjoyed. The phrase "simply just to do" implies that the purpose of the activity was not to achieve a specific goal or outcome, but rather to occupy his time. The option "mentally challenged" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it implies a difficulty or struggle, which is not suggested by the sentence.
The question suggests that someone does not like learning, so changing the learning process is necessary. The answer choices "interesting, fun, joyful" imply that the learning process should be engaging and enjoyable, rather than boring or unpleasant. The option "very important" may not necessarily address the issue of someone not liking learning. The option "free" relates more to cost rather than the actual learning process.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the qualities needed to effectively instruct children in a school setting. Of the choices provided, "patience" stands out as the most relevant quality for this purpose. Teaching children can be a challenging and often frustrating task, so it requires a great deal of patience to ensure that they understand the material and remain engaged in the learning process. The other options, such as "boredom" and "inspiration", do not make sense in the given context.
The sentence suggests that grooming pet's nails can be done without causing a negative impact. The choice "satisfaction" could be inferred from the fact that an owner would feel satisfied or happy after successfully grooming their pet's nails without causing any harm. The other options do not appear to fit the context of the sentence, as training and beauty may not necessarily have a direct connection to the action of grooming nails, late may not make sense in context, and injury would be a negative consequence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the man was cleaning his clothes specifically for a date, which implies that he was looking to make himself more attractive to his date. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "ruined" and "sadness" are negative outcomes that the man would not be actively seeking, and "clean clothes" and "look better" are too general to accurately capture the specific goal indicated by the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the person was searching for airline and hotel prices, which strongly suggests that they were planning a trip or vacation. The option "go on vacation" is the most relevant and logical choice, whereas the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence indicates that the person applied lotion for a specific purpose. Lotion is commonly used to moisturize and hydrate skin, which can make it feel smoother and softer. The other options do not make sense in the context of applying lotion.
The sentence suggests that eating breakfast in bed can have a positive effect on one's emotions. The word "assuming that you don't spill anything" implies that the experience can be enjoyable if done correctly. The options "vomiting" and "mess" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Happiness" and "contentment" have positive connotations, but "pleasure" is a more specific and fitting description for the experience of indulging in breakfast in bed.
The sentence states that an "adult man" is getting ready for work, which implies that the person is male and capable of dressing themselves. Therefore, the correct answer would be "dress himself." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are not appropriate actions for someone getting ready for work.
The sentence suggests that the woman was surrounded by other trees while picking from an apple tree, which would likely indicate a natural, outdoor environment rather than an urban or commercial location like a farmer's market. Illinois, New York, and Indiana are all states that have wooded areas, but the word "woods" specifically refers to a dense forest or wooded area, making it the most appropriate choice.
The dictionary is a book and therefore normally belongs on a shelf. A library or classroom might also have a suitable shelf, but the context of the sentence suggests that Mom is cleaning a personal household rather than a public space. The table and desk are possible options, but they are not as suitable as a shelf for long-term storage and organization of a dictionary.
The sentence suggests that the judge played a significant role in the man's ultimate fate, indicating that this decision was crucial. The context implies that the severity of the sentence was what condemned the man, and the option "death" is the most severe punishment that a judge can impose. The other options, such as "go to jail" or "incarceration," may be significant penalties but do not match the severity implied in the sentence. "Intercourse" and "judgement" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Simon bought the cow for work, not for meat, which suggests that he plans to use it for a purpose other than being sold for slaughter. Taking the cow to a butcher shop would contradict this purpose, as it implies that Simon is interested in obtaining meat from the animal. The countryside or city options do not provide any insight as to where Simon might be taking the cow, as both locations could be home to various types of farms or businesses. Canada, while a possible location, is not hinted at by the context of the sentence. The most likely option is a dairy farm, as cows are commonly used for their milk in such establishments.
The word "bored" suggests that the children are looking for something to do to alleviate their boredom. Playing tag is a common activity for children that is both fun and active, making it a likely choice for children looking to pass the time. Walking and changing shoes are not typically activities that children will choose to do to alleviate boredom, while smelling smoke and reaching over have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Canned goods are typically stored in a pantry, which is a small room or closet used for storing food or household items. A pantry is designated specifically for food storage and is often a separate room or space from the kitchen. The other options may also be used for storing canned goods, but they are not as commonly associated with canned goods as the pantry.
The sentence implies that the speaker is recalling a positive memory to help them feel better while they are in the hospital. The word "massage" suggests a relaxing experience, which would likely bring someone pleasure. The other options, such as depression or nostalgia, do not fit the context of a positive memory.
Since the question is asking about maximizing potential customers, it is logical to choose a location with a larger population to draw from. A big city would have more potential customers than a small town or even a shopping mall. While New York is a big city, the answer does not necessarily have to be that specific and could apply to any big city. The other options, such as Idaho or a shopping mall, would likely limit the number of potential customers.
The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A ball is typically a toy, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that a toy store would have a wide variety of balls available for purchase. The kitchen, child's hand, and street are unlikely places to find a ball, and while a soccer game is a possible location, it is not necessarily a good place to get a ball if one is not already in possession of one.
The question is asking for a common chemical reaction that is used as a heat source, and fire is the most commonly known example of this. Coal or wood are fuel sources that can be burned to create a fire, but they are not the actual chemical reaction. Lava is a type of molten rock and not a chemical reaction. A house and solar energy are not related to the question at all.
Piggy banks are often used to save money in a way that makes it difficult to access the saved money without breaking the bank itself. Unlike a cash drawer or purse, piggy banks do not have an easy opening or access point, while boxes and pockets are usually not specifically designed for holding money.
In a restaurant, the menu typically lists all the available food and drink options, including milk. Checking the menu would be the easiest way to find out if the restaurant serves milk. The other choices, such as asking the waitress or checking the accompaniment to the meal, may not always provide accurate information. Cafeterias and home are not related to the context of the question.
The given sentence suggests that the thing being described can hold a limited number of people, and that number is around 100. Classrooms are commonly associated with a specific number of students and are designed to accommodate a limited number of people at a time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John joined the army with the intention of traveling and exploring new places, but when the fighting started, he only saw a specific type of scenery. The most likely option is the battlefield, as it is where soldiers typically fight in wars. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not imply that John would have seen them during his service.
The context of the question suggests that the game being referred to is likely a typical childhood game, which is often played indoors in a family environment. The toy store, bar, and casino are unlikely places for children to play games, while the table is too generic to be a specific location for playing games. The family room, on the other hand, is a commonly known location where families gather and play games together.
The sentence indicates that the consequence of driving a car mentioned in the choices will not involve pain. Automobile accidents and car crashes often result in physical pain and injury, while backache and eye strain can cause discomfort and pain. The only option that does not involve pain is getting tired, which is a common experience for drivers who have been on the road for long periods of time.
The sentence suggests that the air in the place mentioned has been breathed by only a few people recently. A cupboard is a small, enclosed space that is usually kept closed, making it unlikely that many people have been breathing the air inside. The train station, house, and cricket stadium are all large spaces with a lot of people passing through, making it more likely that the air has been breathed by many people. The surface of the earth is a vast area where air is constantly being circulated and exchanged, making it unlikely that the air in any one place has been breathed by only a few people recently.
Bankruptcy is a legal process in which an individual or entity is unable to repay their debts. When a company goes bankrupt, it may file for bankruptcy protection or be forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. In most cases, the company's assets are liquidated or sold to pay off its debts. This process is called liquidation. The other choices do not accurately describe the outcome of bankruptcy. "Own resources" and "branch out" suggest that the company may recover on its own, while "commit crime" is not a legal outcome of bankruptcy, and "game over" is too vague to be a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that a sport is being referred to that doesn't allow the use of hands and in which blood isn't usually spilled. Soccer is a sport that meets both of these criteria, as it is played without the use of hands and physical contact that could cause blood to be spilled is generally discouraged. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the dog ran to the front window and barked, which suggests that the presence the dog is reacting to is located at the front of the house. The options "building," "friend's house," and "classroom" are too general and do not provide any contextual clues related to the sentence. The option "window" is already mentioned in the sentence and would not make sense as the answer. Therefore, "front door" is the most logical choice as it is directly related to the context of the sentence.
The image of people lined up next to a sign suggests a location where people gather to take transportation. A bus stop is a common place where people wait in line to catch a bus, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the image of people lined up next to a sign.
The sentence suggests that the person is doing something actively for a reason, and that reason relates to being able to pay bills. The most logical choice from the options is "making money," as this is the most direct way to ensure that bills can be paid. The other options are either too general or not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that John has achieved a prestigious position, which is likely to be related to professional violin playing. First violin is typically a position in a symphony orchestra, where the first violinist leads and coordinates the other violinists in the orchestra. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general or not related to professional violin playing.
The other options - suitcase, filing cabinet, desk drawer - are physical storage solutions and not suitable for digital files. A computer can be used to store digital files, but it is not the only option. The cloud is a popular and secure way to store digital files, making it the correct answer.
The question specifically mentions water and soap, which are commonly used in washing machines to clean clothes. The other options have no clear connection to the use of water and soap.
An apiary is a place where bees are kept, which suggests that the answer should be related to beekeeping or honey production. The options "jar" and "stick to fingers" do not make sense in this context, while "farmer's market" could be a possible answer as they often sell locally sourced products including honey. However, the best answer is "beehive" as that is where honey is produced and harvested directly from the apiary.
An attache case is a type of briefcase that is traditionally used for business purposes. It usually contains important documents or work-related items, which is why it would make the most sense to bring it to a business meeting. The other options do not align with the professional connotations of an attache case. Bringing it to a hospital or in a shirt, for example, would not make much sense contextually. The overhead compartment and chair options are both possible, but less likely since they do not reflect the purpose or context of the attache case.
The sentence mentions "books" and "chapters", indicating that the context is related to reading. The question asks why books have chapters on the back, suggesting that the answer will involve knowledge about the purpose of book chapters. Chapters in a book are typically used to organize the content and make it easier for readers to navigate and find specific information. Therefore, the correct answer is "read book". The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the family is enjoying their time playing cards and experiencing a positive emotion. Happiness is the most likely option as it is the opposite of sadness and anger, and matches the description of the family being "full of joy." Amusement is also a possibility but may not fully capture the intensity of the joy described in the sentence. Losing money and anger are not consistent with the positive tone of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Jimmy cannot drink in his own home because his wife is an alcoholic on probation. Therefore, he may go to his neighbor's house to drink instead. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions both Amsterdam and Fortis bank, which are both associated with the Netherlands. Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, and Fortis bank was a Dutch multinational bank that was based in Amsterdam. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a place where glue bottles are commonly used. The options of police station and classroom are unlikely as glue is not a common material used in those settings. Desk drawer is too specific and not a location where many glue bottles would be stored. School is too broad and does not offer any specificity to the question. This leaves the art room as the most likely answer, as glue is a common material used in art projects.
The sentence suggests that the meeting between the king and the ambassador is a formal and official one, which would likely take place in a grand and ceremonial space. The throne room is a common location for important meetings and events in monarchies, and is often the designated space for welcoming important guests and conducting official business. The other options do not have the same level of significance or formality as the throne room in this context.
The use of the word "concrete" suggests that the ball is meant to be bounced or played with on a hard surface, making the soccer field and soccer game options potential correct answers. However, the use of the word "kids" and the lack of mention of any organized teams or games makes the street option the most likely correct answer. Playing with balls on the street is a common activity for kids, and concrete is a commonly used surface for playing with small balls like bouncy balls or handballs. The other options do not fit with the context of the question.
The words "diving off a cliff" and "cartoon character" suggest a humorous or exaggerated scenario, which would align with the word "comedy." The word "splat" is often used in cartoons to represent a character hitting the ground or a solid surface after a fall, which would make sense given the context. The other options (exhilaration, dismemberment, spinal injuries, and getting wet) do not fit the comedic tone implied by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jimmy did not enjoy the atmosphere of the party. The phrase "did nothing but" indicates that the guys at the party were engaged in a repeated or continuous behavior. Of the given choices, "getting drunk" is the most likely behavior to elicit a negative reaction from someone who does not enjoy that kind of activity. The other options, such as dancing or meeting new people, do not necessarily imply negative feelings.
The sentence suggests that a person needs to get something when they have more kids, and larger house is the option that directly relates to this need. When a family expands, they may require more space in their home to accommodate everyone's needs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they all relate to personal growth or relationships rather than practical needs for a growing family.
A ficus is a type of tree commonly found in indoor settings, often used for its decorative foliage. Botanical gardens and arboretums are both places where one might find a special ficus, as they are locations dedicated to the cultivation and display of plants. A doctor's office or public place would be less likely to have a special ficus, and "in a sea" does not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James is concerned about not having all the qualifications that the job requires, which could make him less likely to be accepted or hired. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there may be a sign that someone will not be living soon, and out of the options given, shuddering is the most likely choice. Shuddering can be a symptom of a serious medical condition, such as a stroke or seizure, which could potentially threaten one's life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that riding a bike through rough terrain can be dangerous, indicating that there is a risk of an accident occurring. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "obtuse" typically means confusing or difficult to understand, so the opposite of this would be something that is easy to understand or clear. The other answer choices (pointed, bright, acute angled) do not have a clear connection to the definition of "obtuse" and are therefore unlikely to be correct.
The sentence suggests that some customers prefer to have their purchases delivered straight to their doorstep, which is a service commonly provided through mail orders. Mail orders allow customers to purchase products remotely and have them shipped to their preferred address, which can be more convenient than going to a physical store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Exercise has been widely associated with various health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle strength and endurance, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The other options, such as heart attacks or fatigue, are negative outcomes that are not commonly associated with exercise. Relaxation and rest may be some benefits of exercise, but they are more specific and not as overarching as good health.
The question is asking about the placement of a utensil on one side of a plate, which indicates that it is a part of the table setting. The other options do not make logical sense in this context. A spoon would not typically be placed in a bowl of soup or a serving dish, and it would not be relevant to a placemat or a glass of iced tea.
Sheet music is the most common form of written music notation and is specifically designed to indicate a melody, often including information about rhythm, tempo, and dynamics as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to music notation or indicating a melody.
The question implies that the years of playing tennis have a negative impact on the player's body. Tennis elbow is a common injury that occurs from repetitive wrist and forearm motions, which are common in tennis. The other choices do not fit with the context of the question, as they are either positive outcomes (professional player, victory) or general effects of playing tennis (exercise, becoming tired).
The sentence mentions a roller coaster, which is a common attraction found at amusement parks. Parking lots near roller coasters are likely to be located at amusement parks. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A virus is a type of microorganism that infects living organisms, including humans. The word "primarily" in the question indicates that there may be other actions a virus can do, but the primary one is to infect. Reproduction and mutation are also common actions of viruses, but they are secondary to their ability to infect. The other options are not related to the function of a virus.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place where they can buy a cake instead of making one themselves. The options "theater," "refrigerator," and "oven" do not make sense in this context. A "grocery store" might have the ingredients to make a cake, but it is not necessarily where someone would go to buy a pre-made cake. A "bakery," however, is specifically known for selling baked goods, including cakes, so it is the most appropriate choice.
Synagogues are places of worship in the Jewish religion, and cleanliness is considered a vital component of religious observance. The floors and other surfaces are kept clean to prepare for prayer and other sacred activities. In contrast, restaurants and other buildings may have a less strict standard of cleanliness, and carpets are often not considered the most hygienic surfaces. The basement is also unlikely to be associated with holy purposes in this context.
The sentence implies that there is a war happening and that a bullet projectile is involved. It is likely that the bullet projectile would be found on the battle field, where the fighting is taking place. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to the concept of a queen not always being present. In a bee hive, there may not always be a queen bee present, as she may have died or been replaced by a new queen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of a queen not always being present.
The sentence suggests that learning hard concepts requires a certain quality or characteristic. "Intelligent" is a common trait associated with the ability to learn difficult concepts. The concept of copying is not relevant to the context of the sentence, and the other options may contribute to learning but do not directly answer the question of what is needed to learn hard concepts.
The sentence suggests that exercise is a way for addicts to cope with their addictions, and the correct answer should reflect why exercise is helpful for this purpose. Exercising helps individuals expend energy and release endorphins, which can produce a natural high and reduce cravings for drugs or other addictive substances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence contrasts the sound that a person would hear at sunset (a night owl) with the sound that they would hear at sunrise. The options "morning person," "early bird," "lark," and "early riser" all refer to people who are awake early in the morning, but they do not make a noise that is commonly associated with that time of day. A rooster, however, is known for its crowing at dawn, which makes it the most likely answer.
The other choices are all places or activities that are commonly associated with children's interests or enjoyment. A classroom may be associated with learning and socializing with peers, a toy store offers the opportunity to explore and choose from a wide variety of toys, a soccer game provides the chance to engage in physical activity and competition, and school in general offers a more structured environment for children to learn and grow. In contrast, dinner may be seen as a routine or tedious activity, especially if it involves eating something that the child dislikes.
The question is asking about the preference of rich people in terms of bagels. The word "like" suggests that the answer is a positive attribute, so we can eliminate options like "poor" and "homeless." The word "sleepy" has no clear connection to bagels, so it can also be eliminated. The words "plain" and "needy" might be more likely to describe a bagel, but "needy" is not a positive attribute, so we can eliminate it. This leaves us with "plain" as the most likely answer, as many people enjoy plain bagels and it does not have any negative connotations.
The sentence suggests that the shop will give you something in exchange for your purchases, which is commonly a container to carry the items. This is a common practice in retail, where customers are given shopping bags or other types of containers to hold their purchases. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
A small knight is likely referring to a chess piece, which is used in the game of chess. Therefore, the correct answer would be a place where chess is played or where chess pieces are commonly found, such as a chess board. The other options, such as fairy tales or doll houses, do not have a clear association with chess pieces.
The question is asking about a method of getting in shape when there is no land nearby. Swimming is a good option because it can be done in bodies of water such as pools, lakes, or oceans. Jogging and working out usually require a solid surface to run or exercise on, and rock climbing requires a specific type of terrain. While exercise in general can help with getting in shape, the question specifically mentions a lack of land, making swimming the most viable option.
The question is asking about the consequences of doing a poor job. While the other options may be related to work performance, criticism is specifically related to receiving negative feedback from one's boss in response to poor performance. The other options do not directly address the consequences of doing a poor job.
The cabinets were bought by John and their purpose is not very clearly stated, but it can be inferred that they will be installed in a place where they can be seen and appreciated for their looks. Kitchens are a common area where cabinets are installed for both practical and aesthetic purposes. The other options, such as pantry or containing pots and pans, are related to the kitchen and may be areas where cabinets can be installed, but they do not specifically suggest that the cabinets were bought for their looks. In a flight or in Mexico have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a negative consequence that two people competing might experience. Of the choices given, stress, tension, and winning or losing can be consequences of competition, but they don't necessarily involve interaction between the competitors. Debates also involve interaction, but they don't necessarily have negative connotations. Arguments, on the other hand, are typically negative and involve two or more people attempting to prove their point, often leading to heightened emotions and conflict. Therefore, the correct answer is argument.
AI (artificial intelligence) machines are typically programmed to perform a variety of tasks, including answering questions. AI technology is designed to analyze data and provide responses based on that data, making it well-suited for tasks that require processing large amounts of information quickly and accurately. The other options (flying, milking cows, eating, failing to work) do not have any direct connection to AI technology.
The sentence suggests that Bob and Boris were bothered by the loud children in front of them in the queue, which is commonly associated with being annoyed. Frustration and delays can be caused by various factors such as long waiting times or slow service, but there is no indication of this in the sentence. Irritation may be a similar option, but being annoyed captures the specific feeling of being bothered by the noise. Out of order does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the blowfish lives on its own and is not confined to a specific location. This suggests that the blowfish lives in the wild or the natural environment, which is often referred to as the great outdoors. The other options are not likely habitats for a free-living blowfish.
A paper notice is typically left on a front door as a way to communicate information to the occupants of a house. This could be a notice from a delivery service, a reminder about an upcoming appointment, or a notice about a community event. The other options, such as conference or suitcase, do not make sense in the context of leaving a paper notice.
The sentence suggests that the people being described are intentionally hurting others, which is a trait commonly associated with cruelty. Deception and aggression could also be traits exhibited in such a scenario, but they do not necessarily imply the intention to harm others. Altruism is the opposite of harming others, and stupidity is not a trait commonly associated with intentional harm.
The sentence mentions the child pounding his mitt, which is a common action seen in baseball games. Additionally, the sentence mentions "enjoying his first game in the bleachers," which implies that the child is watching a spectator sport rather than participating in an activity like a laboratory or pharmacy. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Eating uncooked chicken can lead to various illnesses caused by bacteria such as salmonella, which can cause symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The poor man likely felt sick after eating the uncooked chicken. The other options are also possible consequences of eating uncooked chicken, but "illness" is the most general and accurate description of what the poor man experienced.
The sentence suggests that the man's excessive handwashing caused some negative consequence, which is likely to be irritation. Excessive handwashing can lead to dry and irritated skin due to the loss of natural oils and moisture. The option "use soap" is not a consequence but a possible action related to handwashing. "Cleanliness" and "thinking" are unlikely to be negative consequences of obsessive handwashing. "Wet towel" is also not relevant to the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person is on the beach, which is often associated with sunny weather and opportunities for sunbathing. Additionally, the phrase "laying on the beach" suggests a relaxed and leisurely activity, which supports the idea of sunning oneself for enjoyment or relaxation. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence or are unlikely motivations for someone laying on a beach.
The description of the child's playroom as "massive" implies that they are wealthy and live in a large home. The option "big house" is the only choice that fits this description, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "begins and ends with new life" suggests that the sentence is about reproduction and the creation of new life. The word "reproducing" in the sentence also supports this idea. Of the answer choices, "birth" is the only option that directly relates to the creation of new life. The other options are not related to reproduction and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The North Pole is located at the top of the globe, and is known for its extremely cold temperatures and consistent presence of snow and ice. Africa is located near the equator and tends to have warm temperatures year-round, making it unlikely to always have snow. The roof and surface of the earth are not specific locations known for having snow, and Canada is known for its cold winters and snow, but not necessarily always having it year-round in all regions.
The sentence suggests that a person wants to fit in with their friends and have fun. To fit in and have fun, it's important to feel understood by others, which is a common desire among social beings. The other options may contribute to having fun with friends, but they do not necessarily address the underlying desire to fit in and feel understood.
The sentence suggests that the goal is to teach the children teamwork, which is a common objective in sports. Sports require coordination and communication among team members to achieve a common goal, so it makes sense that the parents would sign their children up for sports to help them learn about teamwork. The other options do not necessarily involve teamwork in the same way that sports would.
The sentence suggests that the human is feeling sleepy and needs to be more alert. Drinking coffee is a common solution for feeling more awake and alert, as caffeine is a stimulant that can help counteract drowsiness. The other options, such as dreaming, thinking critically, crossing a road, or driving a car, are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide a solution for feeling more alert.
A city is a large urban area that is densely populated and has a high concentration of businesses and services, including sporting goods stores. In contrast, a town is a smaller urban area that typically has fewer businesses and services, and would be less likely to have hundreds of sporting goods stores. ESPN is a television network that specializes in sports coverage, but does not have any physical stores. Jerseys are a type of athletic equipment, but the question asks for a place, not an item. Therefore, the best answer is city.
The sentence suggests that the little girl had a selfish upbringing, which may have influenced her behavior. The phrase "she didn't even care" implies that she was intentionally doing something that was considered negative or hurtful. "Being mean" is a common behavior associated with selfishness, while the other options (crack, antipathy, disinterest, unfeeling) do not have a clear connection to the context given in the sentence.
The sentence explicitly mentions "exploring space," which immediately eliminates the options of a public place, roadblock, hoverboard, and supermarket. The only logical answer remaining is a space shuttle, as it is a vehicle designed specifically for space travel.
Botanic gardens are known for their collection of various plant species, including rare and exotic ones. Roses, being a popular flower species, can be found in many botanic gardens across the world. Flower gardens may also have a variety of roses, but they may not necessarily have the rarest or most unusual varieties. Backyards and supermarkets typically have a more limited selection of rose varieties, while "outdoors" is too vague to be a reliable answer.
The other options (ocean, universe, attic, chair) are too broad or unrelated to the context of the question. The context suggests that a light is needed for a specific task, and a desk is a common location for a task light.
The sentence implies that there is a specific risk associated with eating a hamburger from someone you do not know, which is not present when you usually eat a hamburger. Food poisoning is a common risk when eating food that has not been prepared properly or stored correctly, especially when eating food from sources that may not have strict food safety standards. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence clearly indicates that the person touched an exposed wire, which can result in an electric shock. Therefore, it would not be surprising for the person to feel shocked when touching the wire. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the physical sensation or action of touching an exposed wire.
The sentence provides information about the geographic location of the person, indicating that they are located in a landlocked, southern state. Of the options provided, South Carolina is the only southern state listed, and the option "hen house" is not a location where a person would typically see a fox. Additionally, the option "at the zoo" implies that the fox is in captivity, which is not specified in the sentence. The options "louisiana" and "arkansas" are both southern states, but the sentence narrows the possible location down to one state, South Carolina.
The phrase "more orthodox behavior" suggests that the priest is advocating for traditional and strict adherence to religious doctrines and practices. The word "heretical" means departing from or denying fundamental religious beliefs or principles, and is the opposite of orthodox. The other choices may not necessarily be opposed to the priest's push for more orthodox behavior, or may be unrelated to religious principles.
The sentence suggests that the person felt a sense of relief and freshness after getting out of the car in the mountains. The phrase "breathing fresh air" indicates that the person may have been in a stuffy or polluted environment before, and is now enjoying the clean air in the mountains. Therefore, it is logical that the person would take deep breaths to fully appreciate the fresh air. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the person's response to the mountain air.
The sentence suggests that the cow prefers to be inside the stable even after the storm had passed, which implies that the stable is the cow's shelter or home. It is commonly known that cows and other farm animals seek shelter during severe weather conditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Contraceptives are typically obtained at healthcare facilities such as health centers or clinics. Vaginas and medicine cabinets are not places where contraceptives are obtained, and drawers and emergency rooms are not typically associated with contraceptive access.
The Indian Ocean is a body of water on Earth, so the correct answer would be Earth. Mars is a planet and does not contain the Indian Ocean. Asia and the East refer to a geographic region, while the Southern Hemisphere refers to a part of Earth, but none of these answer choices specifically identify the location of the Indian Ocean.
The question is asking where a ficus plant would be suitable for adding brightness to a room. The word "room" suggests that the correct answer will be an indoor location, which rules out the options of middle east and palace. The option of dictionary doesn't make sense since a ficus plant cannot brighten up a book. The option of pots is also not suitable since it refers to a container rather than a location. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is apartment, which is a common location where people might have plants to add aesthetics to their living space.
The sentence suggests that the turkey needs to be stored in a way that prevents it from spoiling. The refrigerator and freezer are both commonly used for this purpose, as they are able to keep food at colder temperatures and slow down the growth of bacteria. The oven is not useful for storing food, as it is typically used for cooking. The option "bought at store" is irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about how to store the turkey.
The word "giant" implies that the hole is large in size, which fits the definition of a gorge. A gorge is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides, often formed by a river or other body of water. The other options do not fit the description of a "giant hole" and are less likely to be found in a plain.
Oxygen is a component of the air we breathe, so if someone needs to keep track of how much oxygen there is, they are likely in an environment where air is present. The other options do not typically contain a significant amount of breathable air, except for possibly the space shuttle, which does have an artificial atmosphere, but still primarily relies on air as a source of oxygen.
The sentence suggests that the man put on his headphones to block out the noise of the other passengers and to relax. The option to "listen to music" makes the most sense, as it is a common way to relax while also shutting out external distractions. The other options do not fit with the context of being on a bus and trying to relax while surrounded by noisy passengers.
The sentence suggests that the person was aware of being pursued by the police and likely preparing to flee or escape. "Prepare to go" is the most logical choice in relation to the context of the sentence. The other options have no clear connection to the situation of being pursued.
Running is often associated with feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction, as it is a physical activity that requires effort and endurance. The other options (flying, sweating, falling down, trip) do not accurately reflect the common feelings and experiences associated with running.
The sentence suggests that the person is fiddling through a music book instead of playing. This implies that they may not have practiced enough to be able to play without looking at the sheet music. Dexterity refers to physical skill, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that this is the issue. Idle time and knowledge of music are not directly related to the problem described in the sentence. A conductor is not relevant to the question as well.
The sentence describes a character who is causing accidents and implies that the character is fragile, suggesting that the character is likely to be easily damaged or destroyed. The character's hope is to find a person who is the opposite of him, suggesting that the person he is looking for is likely to be extremely strong and resistant to damage. The word "indestructible" fits this description well, as it means impossible to destroy or damage. The other options do not fit the context as well, with the exception of "unbreakable," which could also work but is not as strong as "indestructible."
The question is asking where one could obtain a bass clarinet to take home, implying that it would be a rental or purchase. The options of orchestra, school band, and opera house do not typically provide musical instruments for individual use outside of rehearsals or performances. Home is not a realistic option for obtaining a bass clarinet. Therefore, music store is the most likely answer as they specialize in selling and renting musical instruments.
The sentence suggests that in order to make a decision about whether to view artifacts, one needs to undergo some process of knowledge acquisition or understanding. Learning is the only option in the choices that is related to the idea of acquiring knowledge. Painful memories, thinking, awe inspiring, and pleasure are not directly related to the process of making a decision about viewing artifacts.
The sentence indicates that Mary was not comfortable speaking with James because she was not familiar with him. It can be inferred from this that she may come off as shy, as someone who is hesitant to engage with others they do not know. The other options do not necessarily suggest that Mary would appear as shy in this situation.
The sentence suggests that the launch pad was just one component of a larger complex, which is commonly associated with a space center. A space center is a complex where rockets are launched and space exploration operations are conducted, often consisting of various launch pads, communication centers, and support buildings. The other options, such as movie or military installation, do not have any clear connection to the context of launching rockets.
The sentence mentions that items in an electronics store were damaged from the rain, suggesting that they were not properly protected from weather elements. Therefore, it makes sense to store them in a building, where they can be protected from rain and other weather conditions. The other options either do not provide sufficient shelter from the rain or are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man committed suicide, which is often associated with feelings of unhappiness or despair. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the man chose to end his life. It is possible that he was suffering from mental health issues or other personal struggles, which may have contributed to his decision to commit suicide.
The sentence suggests that being "thick" is not desirable, which implies that the opposite trait would be ideal. The word "slender" is commonly used to describe someone who is thin and has a desirable body shape. The other options, such as "free flowing" and "sparse," do not relate to body type or shape in the same way that "slender" does. "Unacquainted" and "diet" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wore inappropriate footwear while walking all day and that as a result, has developed something on their heels and toes. Blisters are a common consequence of wearing poorly fitting or inadequate shoes for a prolonged period of time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the action being described would release energy, but not primarily in your muscles. Thinking requires mental energy, which is not primarily generated by muscles. Venting, shouting, working off, and exercising are all physical actions that can release energy from the body's muscles.
Crossword puzzles are often associated with the use of a dictionary to help solve them, as they require knowledge of words and their meanings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of someone looking to alleviate boredom with the aid of a dictionary.
The question suggests that the answer is something that is made out of only one piece, indicating that it is a single unit without any additional components. A jigsaw puzzle has multiple small pieces that are assembled together, a chess game has a board and multiple pieces, and the misspelled options "jigsaw puzzel puxxle" and "puxxle" are not actual objects. The puzzle box, however, is typically made out of one piece of material that is intricately designed to be assembled or opened in a specific way.
The word "mascot" implies that the giraffe was a symbol or representative of a business or organization, and the fact that it was called a cow suggests that the child was not yet familiar with the specific animal. The reference to a "now defunct" entity indicates that the business no longer exists. Out of the given options, a toy store is the most likely candidate for having a mascot, and the fond memory implies that the child enjoyed visiting the store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was navigating through a large building with different levels and rooms, indicating that they were likely in an office building or a similar complex. The other options, such as a school or a hotel, may have multiple floors as well, but do not have the same connotation of being a labyrinthine structure that can cause confusion and get someone lost.
The sentence lists different ways that corn can be prepared, which suggests that the topic of the sentence is related to food. The phrase "people like to" further indicates that the sentence is discussing a popular activity or preference. The options "expect to die" and "believe in god" are not relevant to the topic of corn or food in general, while "stay in" and "watch movies" do not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, "eat corn" is the most appropriate answer.
The word "conscience" refers to a person's inner sense of what is right and wrong. Committing a murder is a serious violation of societal and moral norms, and it is likely that the perpetrator would experience a powerful sense of guilt and remorse. The other options refer more to the legal consequences of committing a murder and do not directly address the emotional or moral consequences.
The sentence suggests that the man had a car, but that it caused more problems than benefits while living in the city. The fact that he "still had to walk" suggests that he did not use his car to commute. The most likely reason for this is that he parked his car elsewhere, such as in a parking garage, which would require him to still walk to and from it after commuting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "notoriety" means the state of being famous or well-known, especially for something considered negative or controversial. If the goal of telling many people about a new organization is to gain attention and recognition, then "notoriety" would be the most appropriate answer. The other options do not fit the context as well: "accomplish" suggests achieving a specific objective, "learn about" implies seeking knowledge, "money" implies financial gain, and "religion" limits the scope of the possible goals mentioned.
Stool legs are typically made of metal or wood, and a blacksmith's shop would be a likely place to find someone skilled in metalworking who could create sturdy, durable legs for a stool. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of stool leg construction.
The sentence suggests that the people are scared of someone, which implies that they perceive the person as a threat or a source of danger. The other options lack any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When traveling to another country, a common mode of transportation is by train. Train stations sell tickets for cross-border trips, and these tickets are necessary to gain entry to another country. The other options, such as a baseball stadium, lottery, movie, or bus, do not have any clear connection to cross-border travel or the need for a ticket to enter another country.
The sentence suggests that playing aggressively can have negative consequences, which may be associated with physical harm or injury. Laughter, having fun, and feeling happy all suggest positive emotions that are commonly associated with enjoyable activities, while getting hungry has no clear connection to playing aggressively.
The sentence implies that the students are actively doing something, and that something is related to asking questions. This suggests that they are in a learning environment, where asking questions is expected and encouraged. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence - becoming an adult, studying philosophy, and furthering education are more general goals that may apply to students, but they do not necessarily describe what the students are doing at the moment. Studying together is a possible activity for students, but it is not mentioned in the sentence.
The question is asking about where farmers keep toothpicks, which suggests that toothpicks are used for something specific on a farm. One possible explanation is that toothpicks are used to clean the teeth of animals, such as horses or cows. Keeping the toothpicks in a box would be a practical way to store them in a organized and accessible manner. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the detective had to carefully examine all of the clues left at the scene to solve the case. The word "analyze" specifically means to examine something in great detail or to break it down into smaller parts, which is exactly what the detective would need to do with the clues. The other options do not match the meaning of the sentence.
The context of the sentence refers to skin color, which is a hereditary trait. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a person with brown skin may share that trait with their family members. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A chain ring is commonly seen in the context of a motorcycle, as it is a component of the motorcycle's drive system. It is used to transfer power from the engine to the rear wheel using a chain. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of screwing a chain ring, and would not require such a component to be used in their construction or repair.
The question is asking where to put a dictionary while it's being used, which implies that the dictionary needs to be easily accessible. A table is a flat surface that is commonly used for tasks that require close attention and access to materials, such as reading or writing. A dictionary is a reference tool that is frequently used alongside other materials, so having it on a table would make it convenient to reach and use while working. The other options (library, study area, classroom, shelf) do not necessarily offer the same level of accessibility or convenience for immediate use.
The phrase "go forth" typically means to move forward or proceed, so the contrasting word or phrase would suggest the opposite of forward movement. The only choice that directly contrasts with "go forth" in this way is "backwards." The other options either repeat words or do not provide an opposite meaning.
The sentence suggests that being awake is related to being aware of what's going on. Being alert is typically associated with being awake and aware of one's surroundings, while deep sleep and drinking coffee may indicate the opposite state of mind. Opening one's eyes is a necessary step to becoming awake, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee alertness. Consciousness is a broad term that could include both wakefulness and other states of awareness.
Swords are typically kept in a container called a scabbard, which is designed to protect and hold the sword while not in use. A sheath is another word for a scabbard, and a sword closet or collection may also contain swords, but neither term specifically refers to the container for the sword. A museum may have swords on display, but they would not be found in your personal house.
The sentence suggests that Bill continued to fight against the enemy, indicating that he actively participated in the conflict rather than giving up or surrendering. "Engage" is commonly used to describe someone who is actively involved in a fight or battle. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest actions that are not related to fighting or conflict.
The word "reserve" suggests that the question is about making a reservation for a place to stay. Among the options, the only one that typically involves reserving a room is a motel. While other places may have showers available, a motel room is the most likely option to have a shower as an expected amenity. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "race" in the question suggests a competition or contest, and humans typically compete with each other in races such as running, swimming, or cycling. The other options such as laying eggs or eating fruit are not relevant to human races, and wrestling may not always be a part of a race. Drawing pictures also has no connection to the context of the question.
The presence of light sensors and automatic doors suggests that the garage is part of a modern house. Such houses typically incorporate cutting-edge technology and design elements that prioritize convenience and efficiency, including features like smart lighting and automated doors. The other options do not provide any indication of the type of house described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a workplace where people gather near liquid. The option "water cooler" is the most likely choice as it is a common fixture in workplaces where employees often gather to chat and take a break. The other options are not relevant to a workplace context or do not involve liquids. The option "opera" is a cultural event, "hospital" is a medical facility, "hockey game" is a sports event, and "beach" is a recreational spot.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to carry their tent with them while camping. The only option that allows for this is a backpack, which can be worn on a person's back and store a tent inside of it. The other options do not provide a way to carry a tent on one's person.
The sentence suggests that Billy moved away from a place where his parents were fighting. The most likely place for this to occur is at home. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that fox hunting is a common activity in England, and the question is asking where a fox hunting might occur outside of a typical forest habitat. The other options such as arctic tundra or beach do not provide a suitable environment for fox hunting. "Great outdoors" is too broad, and "open meadow" could potentially work, but the sentence does not provide any evidence to support that as a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Lindy is old enough to be considered a senior, and that he is living with his children. The most likely reason he would do this is if he did not want to go to an old people's home. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
When the ground gets wet, it is likely due to something melting such as snow, ice, or frozen ground. Solidifying would not cause the ground to get wet, but rather the opposite - it would become more solid. Getting cold or feeling cold may be related to weather conditions, but they do not directly explain why the ground is getting wet. Skin rash is not relevant to the context of the question.
The question is asking about where most people keep magazines, which implies that it is a common practice for individuals to keep magazines in a specific location. Out of the choices provided, only "home" fits this criteria as it is the most likely place for an individual to keep their own personal magazines. Bookstores and libraries are locations where magazines can be found, but not necessarily where they are kept by individuals. Doctors' offices may have magazines for patients to read, but again, this is not where most people keep their own magazines. "Table" may be a location within a home where magazines are kept, but this is not necessarily the most common location.
This question is likely referencing the controversial practice of consuming dog meat in some regions of China. While consuming dog meat is not a widespread practice in Chinese cuisine, it does exist in some regions and has been subject to criticism from animal rights organizations. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Counseling is a form of therapy where a person can talk to a trained professional about their problems or concerns in a safe and non-judgmental environment. An important part of counseling is the therapist's ability to listen actively and provide empathetic responses that validate the person's feelings and promote self-awareness. Therefore, going to counseling is usually for the purpose of getting a chance to talk and be heard, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of oneself. The other options do not accurately reflect the primary goals of counseling.
A water spout is a weather phenomenon, which is commonly seen in coastal areas during thunderstorms. Florida is a coastal state and is known for experiencing frequent thunderstorms, which makes it a likely location for a water spout to occur. The other options such as basement, sink, beach, and fountain do not have any connection with the context of the sentence.
The Empire State building is widely known for being one of the tallest buildings in the world, so the answer is likely to be "tall." The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - the Empire State building is not small, underground, or huge, though it certainly is high!
The use of the term "frat boys" suggests that the sentence is referencing a group of college-aged men who engage in partying and sexual activities. The phrase "have fun" is often used as a euphemism for engaging in sexual activity, and the specific wording "get laid" is a more explicit way of expressing this. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the behavior associated with frat parties.
The phrase "having fun" typically implies that someone is enjoying themselves and finding pleasure in the activity they are engaged in. Laughing is a common physical expression of happiness and enjoyment, so it would make sense for someone who is having fun to also be laughing. The other choices, such as smoking or stress relief, do not necessarily correlate with having fun.
Jogging is a form of exercise that can burn calories, which can contribute to weight loss. The other answer choices, such as feeling pride or getting tired, are not necessarily goals of jogging. Additionally, "run away" is not a common or appropriate goal for jogging.
The sentence mentions smoke detectors going off, which suggests that there was a potential danger of fire. However, the sentence also states that it was a false alarm, meaning that there was no actual fire. This narrows down the possible reasons for John being stuck to something other than a fire. The sentence also mentions a winter storm, which is a more likely explanation for John being stuck in his house. Face south and belong to are unrelated to the context of the sentence, while burn down is a possible consequence of a fire but not a reason for John being stuck.
The phrase "master control for the Tardis" suggests that this is a specific location within a larger structure or vehicle. The word "center" is also commonly associated with control panels, command centers, or other central locations for operations. The other options - nuclear power plant, basement, main office, and bowel of the ship - are either irrelevant, too specific, or too general to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the old barn was damaged to the point that it couldn't be repaired, and therefore needed to be demolished before a new one could be constructed in its place. The word "build" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as the other options do not relate to the idea of constructing a new barn. "Make" and "entice" do not make sense in connection with a barn, while "raise" is typically used in reference to money or raising animals, not constructing a building.
A shopping bag for packing groceries is typically provided by a supermarket or grocery store for customers to carry their purchased items. The other options (home, closet, mart, hardware store) are not relevant as they do not typically provide shopping bags for this purpose.
The context of the sentence suggests that the lady is concerned about the safety of people in their area, as the article discusses an increase in accidents. The husband's response implies that accidents are a common occurrence and that they happen to people. The other options may also be true, but they do not directly relate to the context of the article or the conversation between the couple.
An anthology refers to a collection of literary works or episodes from a television series that are related in some way. In the given sentence, it is mentioned that there was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, and the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers. This suggests that both episodes were related to the theme of flowers, and were part of an anthology series that focused on different aspects of gardening or nature. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the cupboards were empty or barren, meaning there were no ingredients or food available to cook with. Therefore, the only option left for them to eat was to leave the house and obtain food from an external source. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not address the lack of food in the cupboards.
Fleas are known for their ability to jump, and this is their primary mode of locomotion. Fleas use their powerful hind legs to propel themselves up to 200 times their body length, allowing them to move quickly and efficiently through fur or hair. The other options - attack, suck blood, stay, and lay eggs - are all behaviors or actions associated with fleas, but do not describe how they move.
While it is possible to find prostitutes on the street corner, this option may not be the most reliable or safe. A more professional and regulated location for prostitution would be a brothel or whorehouse, which is likely to offer a higher level of safety and hygiene. New York is also known for having a high concentration of sex workers, making it a likely choice for finding a professional prostitute. The option "corner of two streets" does not provide any relevant information to this question, and "brother" is completely unrelated.
The sentence suggests that the object being referred to is a light source that is decorative and vintage. This description is most commonly associated with lamps, which are often used for their aesthetic value as well as their functional purpose of providing light. The other options (sun, sky, candle, house) either do not fit the context of the sentence or are not commonly associated with being vintage or decorative light sources.
The question suggests that the person is unable to leave their house but still has a desire to learn or explore a topic. Surfing the internet would allow them to access a wide range of information and resources about the topic of interest without having to physically leave their home. The other options require leaving the house, such as going to see exhibits, attending an outdoor concert, or hearing testimony in person.
The sentence states that Sam was against Allison's decision and Joe was the opposite. This suggests that Joe was not against Allison's decision like Sam was, but rather for it. The option "being for" expresses this idea directly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or convey the opposite of Sam's stance in relation to Allison's decision.
Working with wood can be physically demanding and requires the use of tools that can create friction against the skin, leading to blisters. This suggests that the reason for not wanting to work with wood may be related to physical discomfort. The other options are focused on financial or emotional reasons, which do not relate to the physical pain of blisters.
The sentence implies that the person was better at social science than traditional science, and that social science was their favorite subject. Geography, history studies, and religion could fall under the category of social science, but the sentence doesn't specifically mention them as being the person's favorite subject. Math and dancing are not related to either traditional or social science, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the gentleman in question is very rich and likes to show it off. Living in a palace would be a fitting choice as they are grand and luxurious buildings typically associated with wealth and status. The other options, such as "big house" or "men's room," do not necessarily connote wealth or lavishness in the same way that a palace would.
A bookstore is a type of retail establishment that specializes in selling books, so it is likely to be found in a location where there is a significant population of book buyers. Towns and cities are both likely to have bookstores, although they may differ in their size and variety of offerings. Carpeting, phone books, and magazines are not likely to be places where one can find a bookstore.
The sentence suggests that Jill was not well-liked or respected by many people, except for John. The word "respect" indicates that John held her in high regard, but the phrase "not many other people did" indicates that most others did not feel the same way about Jill. The word "disparagement" means criticism or belittlement, which could explain why Jill was not well-liked or respected by many people. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the person has trouble beginning work, which can be a symptom of procrastination. Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing something that needs to be done, often due to a feeling of anxiety or a lack of motivation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as sitting down, excitement, tiredness, and progress do not necessarily have a direct link to starting work.
The sentence implies that waiting for the doctor is a problem for people who need to do work, which suggests that the waiting process takes up a significant amount of time. "Time consuming" is a phrase commonly used to describe activities that take up large amounts of time or resources, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why waiting for the doctor would be difficult for people who need to do work.
The question suggests that the goal is to ensure viewing enjoyment while not experiencing curiosity, which may imply that the person wants to watch something familiar or comforting. Watching a favorite show is likely to provide entertainment and a sense of familiarity, which could satisfy the desire for viewing enjoyment. The other options, such as examining things or staring into a mirror, do not relate to watching something for entertainment or enjoyment. Hearing news or going somewhere may spark curiosity, which is not what the question is asking for.
The sentence implies that the gambler had won a significant amount of money and chose to do something with it. "Cash in" is a common phrase used to describe the act of exchanging something for money, which would make sense in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The phrase "make love" is a common euphemism for engaging in sexual activities with a partner. Given that the question asks about what a lover is likely to want to do with their partner, it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer pertains to intimacy or physical affection. The other options may be desirable outcomes in a relationship, but they do not specifically relate to physical intimacy.
The sentence suggests that the person filling the bag with clothes will need to go to a retail location where bags are typically provided after purchase. Shopping malls are a common location for retail shops that sell clothes and provide bags for customers to carry their purchases. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the sample needed to be pure, but the lab assistant did something to it that affected its purity. The word "contaminated" means that something has been made impure or tainted, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices don't fit with the context, as they don't describe something that could happen to a sample in a lab.
Historically, leeches were commonly used in medical treatments to "let blood" from a patient's body as a means of addressing various ailments. This practice was known as bloodletting and was believed to balance the body's humors, or fluids. While leeches have also been used in modern medicine for certain purposes (such as promoting blood circulation and reducing swelling), bloodletting is generally considered a outdated and ineffective treatment. The other options (heart transplant, distance himself, perform surgery, study medicine) do not have any connection to the historical use of leeches.
The sentence implies that the person is actively seeking new experiences or opportunities in their life, which suggests a desire for change. The phrase "looking for new things" is a clear indication of their motivations, and the option "welcome change" best captures this sentiment. The other options are either irrelevant or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about where to put a handle if you want to bring the object with you. Out of the choices given, only "carry object" makes sense because a handle on a carry object, such as a bag or suitcase, is designed to make it easier to transport. The other options do not make sense in this context - a handle on a coffee cup or frying pan would not make it easier to carry, and a handle on a hat would not serve a practical purpose for transportation.
It is a basic requirement to have money or financial resources before buying any products. Desire and needs may influence the decision to purchase, but ultimately, having the monetary means to pay for the item is necessary. Spending money and time are not prerequisites for purchasing, as the former implies that the money has already been spent, and the latter may not be relevant to the context of buying products.
The sentence mentions that they were competing in basketball, which is a sport where the objective is to score points by throwing the ball into the opposing team's basket. The other options are not the specific objective of basketball, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that traveling can be tiring, which typically leads to a feeling of exhaustion or weariness. This is commonly referred to as fatigue. Sickness and motion sickness are unrelated to the context of traveling, while relocation refers to a permanent move rather than a one-time trip. Jet lag is a common side effect of traveling across time zones, but it is more specific than the general feeling of fatigue that the question is asking about.
The sentence implies that being great at something requires more than luck, and that a person needs to have a certain quality in order to achieve greatness. The use of the word "focus" suggests that this quality is related to being committed and determined, which can be further described as "dedication". The other options do not match the meaning of the sentence, as hatred and surprised have negative connotations, compliments are not related to achieving greatness, and solutions do not fit the context.
The question is asking about the effect of exposure to noises on humans. Hearing sounds is the most logical answer as it is a direct and immediate effect of exposure to noise. The other options, such as petting a dog, having sex, or driving cars, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question. Reproduction may be a possible long-term effect of noise exposure, but it is not an immediate or certain outcome.
The sentence implies that the purpose of listening to an expert speak is to gain knowledge or information. Learning is a common reason why people attend lectures or speeches given by experts. Fatigue, mercy, empathy, and anxiety do not relate to the context of gaining knowledge from an expert speaker.
An old copy machine would likely be found in an office since copy machines are commonly used in work environments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are less likely places to find a copy machine.
The sentence implies that the child has to do a task related to cleaning up after breakfast. Washing dishes is a common chore that is performed after meals. The other options, such as dropping out of school or entering school, are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Asking questions and reading a book might be something a child does, but it is not something that has to be done before getting on the bus.
The phrase "dime a dozen" suggests that the large container is very common and easily found. The options that fit this description are factory, supermarket, garage, and warehouse. However, the mention of "hundreds of rows" suggests that the container is being stored in a large space, which is most likely a warehouse. The other options do not fit the context as well.
The sentence indicates that the snake in question is a cottonmouth, which is a venomous snake found in the southeastern United States. One of the states where this snake is commonly found is Georgia, making it the correct choice. The other options do not provide any relevant information about where the snake might be from.
The question is asking about what surface one would place furniture on, which logically would be a flat surface within a living space. The options "roof," "apartment," and "neighbor's house" do not fit this description, whereas "room" and "floor" do. However, a room can have furniture placed on the walls or ceiling if it is designed that way, whereas a floor is always a surface meant for furniture placement.
The question is asking about a way to view a county highway as a line, which implies a visual representation. The most likely option is a map, which shows highways and roads as lines for navigational purposes. The other options (from the sky, cross counties by car, country, michigan) do not specifically relate to the ability to view a highway as a line.
The sentence implies that stress can lead to a serious health consequence that could be fatal if not quickly addressed. Heart attacks are a common consequence of stress, as stress can cause the heart to work harder and increase blood pressure. The other options are also potential effects of stress, but they are not specifically mentioned as having the potential for a life-threatening outcome.
The sentence implies that the person is settling down to watch a movie, which is an activity commonly associated with a cinema or movie theater. The other options (park, Martorell, jeep, airplane) do not provide a suitable location for watching a movie.
The sentence suggests that the location where you can read a magazine is a place where you wait for transportation on rails to arrive. This limits the options to train stations, as they are the only location where transportation on rails typically arrives and departures. The other options, such as airports, bookstores, and newsstands, do not fit the criteria outlined in the sentence. Waiting room could potentially fit, but it is not specific enough to suggest that transportation on rails is involved.
The sentence mentions that the farmer chose plants he could make bird feed from and use again the next year. This suggests that the farmer planted seed crops, which are plants grown specifically for their seeds that can be used for replanting or for feeding birds. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that cake might be served alongside ice cream in a social setting, such as a party or celebration. Eating cake and ice cream together is a common tradition for birthdays and other special occasions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context or tradition of serving cake with ice cream.
The sentence explicitly states that James lived in a tall tower, which is a structure that is commonly associated with being high up and providing a good view of the surrounding area. Additionally, the sentence mentions that James can see clouds from his window, which further supports the idea that he is living high above ground level. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as living in books, working at a radio station, or living in a medieval castle do not involve living in a tall tower.
The sentence indicates that the police wanted to clear the scene of an accident, which implies that there was a traffic buildup or obstruction. To address this, the police would likely direct traffic to clear the area and prevent further accidents or delays. The other options either do not relate to the context of the sentence or are not actions the police would typically take in this situation.
The phrase "betting with a shark" is likely meant figuratively, as sharks are known for being predatory and aggressive in various contexts. Betting in a pool hall, a place where people often play billiards or other games for money, can attract players who are skilled or "sharks" at the game. The other options do not make sense in the context of the phrase.
When someone writes a check, it is typically for payment of goods or services. The clerk would take the check and process it by depositing it into the cash register as payment for the sale. The desk drawer, pay envelope, throw away, and box options do not make sense as places to put a check after receiving it as payment.
The word "performers" suggests that the context is related to live entertainment. The phrase "on a platform" indicates that the performers are elevated and visible to an audience, which is commonly found in concert halls. Arenas can also have performers on a platform, but they are more commonly associated with sporting events. A building or museum may have performers, but they are unlikely to be on a platform in a public space. A dock is not a common location for performers, and the sentence does not suggest that the performers are on a boat or ship.
The sentence implies that the person was searching for holiday decorations in a specific location, and unexpectedly found an old box of clothes. The most likely location for someone to store items they don't frequently use, such as decorations or old clothes, is in the attic. The other options, such as trash or closet, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The word "yard" typically refers to a small area of land around a house or building. Farmland, property, and subdivision all suggest larger pieces of land, so they are unlikely to have a "tiny" yard. City could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough to make a definitive choice. Neighborhood, on the other hand, suggests a smaller, more densely populated area where yards might indeed be small.
The question suggests that love is something that many people continue to feel, even though it may be difficult or painful at times. The wording of the question implies that love is a lasting emotion, rather than something that is temporary or fleeting. The other options do not accurately reflect the common understanding of love, which is often associated with long-term commitment and lasting emotional connection.
The word "staple" suggests that balloons are a common and important element at this event. Balloons are often associated with celebrations, and birthday parties are a common occasion where they are used as decorations or given as gifts. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way.
The question is asking about how to transport potatoes from a location to another, suggesting that it is a small amount intended for personal use rather than a large quantity for commercial purposes. Grocery stores are one option for purchasing potatoes, but a bushel basket would be too large for personal use. Restaurants would not be relevant in this context, and while farmer's markets can be a source for potatoes, they are typically sold in smaller quantities that can be easily carried in a bag.
Paper programs are typically provided at live performances, such as theater productions and concerts, as a way for audience members to follow along with the program and learn more about the performance. The other options, such as computer, television, and opera, do not typically provide paper programs as a part of the experience.
The sentence suggests that Billy was playing a game that involved bouncing a ball off a wall, which is a common activity in playrooms. Playrooms often have designated play areas and toys, which could include a ball and a target on the wall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking how an artist can immortalize or remember a horse, and one common way to do this is through a painting. Artists often create portraits of horses to capture their beauty and personality, and these paintings can serve as a lasting tribute to the animal. The other options - hoof, Kentucky Derby, race track, and Triple Crown - are all related to horse racing and do not necessarily involve artistic expression.
The question is asking about where people live, which suggests looking for options related to human habitation. The option "surface of earth" is the most logical choice since it encompasses all areas where people can live, including apartments and houses. The other options are not related to human habitation at all, making them incorrect answers.
The context of the question suggests that the answer should relate to a living thing with a literal lip, which eliminates options like "can" or "Kentucky fried chicken." While both humans and snakes have lips, the latter is more commonly associated with a physical "lip" in the form of the curved upper and lower jaws that make up the snake's mouth. Therefore, the correct answer is "snake."
The question suggests that the color yellow is associated with a characteristic that is the opposite of "fearless." This may be because yellow is often associated with caution or warning, which is a characteristic that might be perceived as lacking in courage or fearlessness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The term "instituting civil action" refers to bringing a legal case against someone in a civil court. The other options are not related to legal proceedings and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The word "celebrating" typically implies joy and happiness, which would make "happiness" the most appropriate choice. While "drinking" or "dancing" may be activities that take place during a celebration, they are not necessarily indicative of the overall mood or feeling of the occasion. "Intimacy" also does not fit the context of a celebration, as it suggests a more personal and private setting. "Enjoyment" could be a possible alternative, but "happiness" is a more direct and appropriate choice.
The sentence mentions a large delivery of shampoo, which implies that it is being delivered to a place that uses a lot of it. The options "supermarket" and "hotel" could also use a lot of shampoo, but the mention of a crate suggests a larger quantity than these locations might typically use. "Shampoo bottle" is unlikely since it refers to a product rather than a location. "Motel" is possible but less likely than "hair salon" since motels may offer other toiletries besides shampoo. Therefore, the best answer is "hair salon."
The phrase "balls of cotton" suggests that the man is looking for some sort of medical supply, likely for cleaning or bandaging a wound. Of the given options, "pocket" is most likely to contain such an item, as people often carry first aid supplies in their pockets or bags. The other options ("south," "Georgia," "North Carolina") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "medicine cabinet" would only be applicable if the man were at home or in a medical facility.
Based on the sentence, it is implied that a rosebush is being discussed and there are no containers available to store it. A flower garden is a logical place to plant a rosebush as it provides the necessary soil and space for the plant to grow. A garden center is where you might buy a rosebush, but it is not a place to plant it. A pot is a container and contradicts the initial statement. A formal garden may or may not have a specific place for a rosebush, but it is not the logical choice without further information.
The question implies that the paper in question is not available for purchase. Therefore, it is unlikely to be found in an office supply store or a printer. A cabinet or a suitcase might contain paper, but there is nothing in the question to suggest that the paper is located there. An artist's studio, however, is a logical place to find large pieces of paper that may be used for artwork and may not be sold to the public.
The sentence suggests that James is hesitant to take a particular action because he fears it will ruin his relationship with Jen. However, he also believes that taking this action might have a positive outcome related to fixing or repairing something. The word "fix" implies that there is something that needs improvement or repair and that James believes this action might help to resolve that issue. The other answer choices do not relate to the context of the sentence or suggest a positive outcome.
When driving at high speeds, it is important to have the ability to stop quickly and safely. This is typically achieved through the use of brakes, which slow down the car and bring it to a stop. Stripes and radios are not related to driving performance or safety, while seat belts are important for overall safety but not specifically related to stopping at a light. Tires may also play a role in braking ability, but are not as directly related as the brakes themselves.
Bob needs a level to hang a shelf, which is a tool used to ensure that objects are straight and even. While the options "glass of water" and "build evenly" may suggest methods to make things straight, they do not provide an answer to where Bob can obtain a level. The option "garage" is too general and does not specify whether there is someone in the garage who may have a level. The option "video game" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the only logical option is "carpenter's shop," where Bob can purchase or borrow a level.
The question is asking about a reason why professionals playing sports would be unable to compete. The most likely reason is due to injuries, which can range from minor sprains and strains to more severe fractures and tears. Pain, sweating, and rain may all be uncomfortable or inconvenient, but they would not necessarily prevent athletes from competing. A mudslide is a rare and extreme weather event that would likely result in the cancellation or postponement of a game, rather than simply preventing athletes from competing.
A concerto is a classical musical form that typically features a soloist accompanied by an orchestra. Therefore, it would be most likely for a musician to perform a concerto for clarinet with an orchestra. The other choices, such as music store, jazz band, rock band, and music studio, do not typically feature orchestral performances of classical music.
The sentence is discussing a newborn opening its eyes for the first time, suggesting that it is experiencing visual stimuli for the first time. Therefore, the correct answer should involve sight. "See light" is the most obvious choice, as it describes the normal response to opening one's eyes. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to the action of opening one's eyes for the first time.
A shed is a small outdoor storage unit typically used for lawnmowers, garden tools, and other outdoor equipment. The sentence indicates that the shed would be located in a town, which suggests that the options "farm yard" and "ranch" are not appropriate choices. The shed is also meant to be close to the house, as per the option "next to the house." However, the best location for a shed in a town is often the backyard because it allows for easy access to the outdoors while keeping the shed out of sight and secure.
The sentence suggests that James's bouncing rubber balls were active and bouncing before he went to sleep, and that he had to put them back in that state in the morning. Therefore, the correct choice would be "in motion." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Meowing is a common vocalization that cats use to communicate with humans and other cats. It is often used to express a variety of needs or desires, such as wanting attention or needing food. The other options do not relate to typical cat behavior or vocalizations.
The sentence suggests that people are receiving bills along with bread, which implies that the bills are being sent through some sort of delivery system. Envelopes are commonly used to send bills and other documents through the mail, making them the most likely answer in this context. The other options do not have a clear connection to the concept of receiving bills through the mail.
An atlas is a commonly used paper map that shows roads, highways, and other geographical features. It is a useful tool for people who are traveling and need to find their way along a specific route. The other options, such as the United States or parks, are not useful for navigation purposes when traveling along a highway.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was comfortable in their own home, but had a fear of going somewhere else. The word "crippling" implies that the fear is severe and debilitating. The option "outside" is the most logical choice, as it is the opposite of being inside one's own home and could potentially cause discomfort or anxiety for someone with a fear of leaving their safe space. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lemurs are primates that are native to Madagascar, an island country off the east coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to many different types of rain forests, including tropical rain forests, which are likely the habitats where native lemurs would be found. The other options do not provide any real connection with the natural habitat of lemurs.
The question mentions a specific location, a red bridge, which suggests that the answer is a place where such a bridge exists. The choices "refrigerator," "engineering school," and "tree" do not fit this criterion. The choice "market" could potentially work, as some markets have decorative bridges, but the most likely answer is "san francisco" as the city is famous for its landmark Golden Gate Bridge, which is red and has pedestrian walkways where people could eat fruit.
The question references a place to keep head wear in an entrance hall, which typically suggests a small space or area. The options "school," "large home," and "house" do not fit this context. The option "closet" could be a possibility, but the question specifically mentions head wear and a hat rack is more commonly associated with storing hats. Therefore, the correct answer is "hat rack."
The sentence suggests that John needs access to electricity for cooking, which is commonly found at rest areas along highways and roads. Rest areas are designed for travelers to take breaks and often have amenities like restrooms and electricity hookups for RVs. The other options do not have any clear connection to providing electricity for an RV.
Turkey is located in both Europe and Asia, but the majority of its land lies within the region of Asia Minor, which is also known as Anatolia. This region is located in western Asia and encompasses most of modern-day Turkey. The other options are not correct geographical regions for Turkey.
The question suggests that something that is surprising and unexpected can make people happy, and the options are related to humor and emotions. Jokes and humor are often associated with making people happy, but they are not necessarily surprising and unexpected. Frightened and fight are related to negative emotions and do not relate to making people happy. Laughter is a common response to humor and unexpected situations, and can be a sign of happiness or amusement. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be laughter.
The sentence suggests that the location must be a place where lizards live in their natural habitat and where Spanish may not be the primary language. Utah and New Hampshire may have lizards, but they are not typically associated with Spanish-speaking communities or culture. Japan is not known for its reptiles, and South America is a large continent with many countries, some of which may speak Spanish. New Mexico, on the other hand, has a variety of lizard species and is known for its culture and history that includes both Spanish and Native American influences.
The other options in the list (suitcase, department store, safe deposit box) all suggest a level of security and protection for the jewelry during travel. However, "lady's boudoir" does not provide any security measures and may even make the jewelry more vulnerable to theft or loss. Therefore, it is not a safe way to transport jewelry on vacation.
The sentence suggests that Johnny wants the conflict between him and Bill to end. The most logical option would be to settle everything, meaning to resolve the issue between them and come to a mutual agreement. The other options are not relevant to the context and may even make the situation worse.
The sentence suggests that the man spends a significant amount of time grooming himself each morning, which implies that he values his appearance. Looking good is the most likely outcome of such a regular grooming routine. Tardiness and injury can be ruled out as they are negative outcomes that do not relate to grooming. Vacation is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Neatness may be a possible result, but is less likely than looking good as the focus of the sentence is on the man's grooming routine rather than his overall tidiness.
The sentence suggests that Sarah found a second heart in the chest of a patient, which indicates that the patient is not a typical human being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "surprise" suggests that the attack caught the opposing force off guard, implying that they were not prepared to defend themselves. Therefore, the attack likely brought an end to the defending force's ability to continue resisting or protecting themselves, making "defence" the correct answer. Surrender would imply that the defending force chose to yield, while retreat suggests they were able to withdraw instead of being defeated. Cease fire implies a mutual agreement to stop fighting, rather than a single force being defeated. Defend is not the correct answer because it is the action taken by the defenders, rather than what the attack ended.
Potatoes are a staple food in Ireland and have played a significant role in the country's history and economy. The potato industry in Ireland dates back to the late 16th century when potatoes were first introduced to the country. Today, Ireland is one of the largest potato producers in Europe, with potatoes being a key component of many traditional Irish dishes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the potato industry.
The sentence suggests that dancing for a long time can have a negative impact on the body, which is commonly associated with fatigue. Fatigue is a condition where the body feels tired or weak, often as a result of physical activity or lack of rest. The other options do not accurately describe the effects of dancing for a long time. Soreness is a possible symptom of fatigue, but it is not a direct result of dancing. Intercourse and expression are unrelated to the topic of dancing for a long time.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about where the majority of people keep their personal curling iron. According to common conventions and habit, people tend to store their personal grooming devices such as curling irons in their bathrooms, which is the most appropriate option among the given choices. The other options don't quite fit because they are not commonly used for storing personal grooming tools like curling irons.
The sentence indicates that the location was once home to a thriving fishing industry, which suggests that it would have been a town or village situated by the sea. The option "resort" implies that the area was primarily developed for tourism, while "ocean" and "beach" are not specific enough to identify a location. "California" is a state and not an appropriate answer for this specific question.
Becoming inebriated or drunk can impair a person's ability to speak coherently and communicate effectively. This is because alcohol affects the brain's ability to process information, making it difficult to concentrate and think clearly. As a result, people who are intoxicated are more likely to slurr their words, mumble, or say nonsensical things. The other options are either consequences of becoming drunk (regret, automobile accidents, drunk driving) or unrelated to the question (talk intelligently).
The question is asking for something that can break up or eliminate a mundane routine, which suggests the need for something different or fresh. The word "new" is directly associated with this idea of introducing something different, and is therefore the most appropriate answer. The other choices - "sophisticated," "arcane," "heavenly," and "imprevist" - do not directly relate to the concept of breaking up a mundane routine, and are therefore incorrect.
A master carpenter is skilled in the craft of woodworking and uses various tools to create and modify objects made from wood. A drill is a commonly used tool for creating holes in wood, and is therefore the correct answer. "Learn," "understand," and "require obedience" are not relevant to the context of the question or to the skill set of a master carpenter. "Spoon" is a tool, but not typically used for creating holes in wood.
Falling from a mountain can be a very dangerous situation, and it is likely to result in severe injury or death. "Die" is the most appropriate answer because it accurately reflects the gravity of the situation. "Act dead" and "explode" do not make sense in this context, while "too much" and "rush" are not fitting choices as they do not pertain to falling from a mountain.
The question is asking for a reason why someone is not listening to music. The answer "deafness" makes the most sense as it is a medical condition where a person cannot hear any sound. The other options are all possible activities or moods that someone might be experiencing while not listening to music, but they do not provide a clear reason for why they are not able to hear it.
The sentence describes David as tired, shaking, and in pain, which suggests that he is experiencing exhaustion or fatigue. The sentence also mentions that he hasn't gotten what he needed in a long time, which could suggest that he has been overworking or not getting enough rest. Addiction may cause physical symptoms, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Relaxation and overeating do not fit with the symptoms described. Headaches could cause pain, but they are not strongly suggested by the context.
The word "moistener" suggests that the item being referred to is likely a product for moisturizing the skin. The options of bathroom, purse, and water do not provide any indication of where such a product might be found. Hand lotion is a similar product, but not necessarily the same as a moistener. Therefore, the best option is a drug store, which is a common place to find moisturizing products such as lotions and creams.
The sentence suggests that there is a specific saucepan that is only used for marinara, and therefore it is likely that this saucepan is kept in a convenient and accessible location in the kitchen. The other options are unlikely to be the correct answer, as they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Vegetarians are people who choose not to eat meat, including beef, pork, chicken, and fish. Instead, they often consume a plant-based diet that includes fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Therefore, the answer that corresponds with a vegetarian's behavior is "eat plants." None of the other answer choices are associated with being a vegetarian.
The phrase "many a song and dance" is commonly associated with musicals, which are movies that incorporate songs and dance into the story. Bollywood is a type of Indian cinema that often features song and dance numbers, but this term is not commonly used to refer to musicals outside of India. Record, jukebox, and Napster have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Danny was enjoying himself while singing in front of his class. Glee is a feeling of great happiness and enjoyment, which fits the context of the sentence. Laughter and being happy are similar but do not specifically fit with the act of singing, while opera and injuries are not relevant to the context at all.
The context of the question suggests that the system of electronic devices is related to education, specifically in a school setting. "Computer science" is the only option that is related to technology and education, and it is common for schools to use electronic devices such as computers and tablets in computer science classes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Reproduction is a biological process that involves the joining of sperm and egg cells to create a new organism. In humans, this typically occurs through sexual intercourse where sperm is transferred from the male to the female reproductive system. Eating ice cream, sitting down, making mistakes, and hearing sounds are all unrelated to reproduction and do not provide any contextual clues to suggest they are the correct answer.
The use of the word "guilty" in the sentence suggests that the murderer was found to be at fault for the killing. The judge's use of the word "pure" suggests that the murderer's actions were completely wrong or immoral. The other options do not accurately capture the severity of being found guilty of murder.
The sentence suggests that the method being described involves using violence to bring about change in society. This is commonly associated with the term "revolution," which refers to a drastic and sometimes violent change in the political or social order. The other options do not convey the same sense of upheaval and change that is implied by the use of violence to bring about societal transformation.
The sentence suggests that there was a change in the formula of Coca-Cola, which was known as "new coke," but it was later discontinued. The question then asks what formula was used after that. Therefore, the correct answer would be the original formula, as it was the formula used before the introduction of "new coke." The other options, such as "old," "coke clear," "former," and "familiar," do not indicate what formula was used after "new coke" was discontinued.
Monkeys are arboreal animals, which means they live primarily in trees. Rainforests are known for their dense foliage and tall trees, which provide ideal habitat for monkeys to climb and swing from branch to branch. While it is possible to see monkeys in zoological gardens or zoos, they are often kept in enclosures or exhibits and may not have access to actual trees. "Rainforest" and "great outdoors" are too general and do not provide specific information about where in the rainforest a monkey may be found.
The sentence suggests that the donation allowed the college to construct something related to science, which would require a specialized building. Fraternity houses and banks are not typically associated with science, while "big town" and "big city" are not specific enough to be a likely answer. Therefore, "building" is the most reasonable choice.
Breathing involves the inhalation of air, which contains oxygen, and the exhalation of waste gases like carbon dioxide. The lungs and diaphragm are organs involved in the breathing process, while the abdominal muscles and open throat are not directly involved. Therefore, the correct answer would be oxygen.
The sentence suggests that the person does not have positive feelings towards the other person and wants them to fail. Antipathy means a strong feeling of dislike or hostility towards someone, which fits the context of the sentence. Unfeeling means lacking in emotion or compassion, but it does not necessarily imply a negative feeling towards someone. Negligence means the failure to take proper care, and indifferent means having no particular interest or sympathy. Rapport means a close and harmonious relationship, which is the opposite of what the sentence describes.
The word "reckless" suggests that the driving behavior is dangerous and potentially harmful. The options "injuries" and "accidents" are both related to the negative effects of reckless driving, whereas "fatigue" and "tired" suggest a different type of driving behavior. "Traffic jams" are not necessarily caused by reckless driving, although it can contribute to it in some cases.
The sentence suggests that the containers were on a long sea journey and needed to be unloaded. The most logical place for this to happen would be at a port, which is a location where ships can dock and unload their cargo. The other options, such as cargo ship or refrigerator, do not make sense in this context as they are not places where containers can be unloaded. Food and lorry may be associated with transporting goods but do not provide a clear answer to where the containers are unloaded.
Lions are primarily found in the grasslands and savannahs of Africa, which are characterized by tall grasses and scattered trees. The other options, such as the ocean and jungle, are not suitable habitats for lions due to their different environments and lack of suitable prey. The veldt is similar to a savannah and could be a possible answer, but the context of the question and the more commonly used term "savannah" suggests that it is the more likely answer.
The sentence mentions that the person's favorite type of entertainment are rollercoasters and ferris wheels, which are commonly found at fairgrounds or amusement parks. The other options do not offer similar attractions and are not relevant to the person's interests.
The phrase "getting lots of attention" suggests that the ferret is in a place where people are interacting with it frequently. A petting zoo is a place where people can interact with animals, including ferrets, and give them attention, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A ferret in a trouser leg, sick bay, own home, or mother's hair may not necessarily be getting a lot of attention.
To confirm an applicant's reference means to verify the information provided by the applicant with the reference. If the reference denies any knowledge of the applicant, it would fail to confirm the reference. The other options do not necessarily imply a failure to confirm the reference. Questioning, disputing, contradicting, or refusing to provide information may still allow for some verification of the applicant's credentials.
The sentence suggests that the group raised their drinks as a gesture of celebration or acknowledgement. The phrase "cheered" further solidifies this idea. "Toasting" is a common action associated with raising a drink in celebration, which makes it the most appropriate choice. "Thirsty" and "refreshment" are not accurate options, as they do not suggest any kind of celebration or gesture of acknowledgement. "Getting drunk" is possible but is not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a person playing a guitar, and someone is watching them. The most logical activity for the watcher to be engaged in would be to listen to the music being played. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - auditioning applies to a different scenario, hear sounds is too general, making music implies that the watcher is also playing, and arthritis is a medical condition that is unrelated to the sentence.
The sentence implies that the animals had difficulty swimming, which could make it harder for them to find a mate and reproduce sexually. Therefore, they may have had to resort to asexual reproduction, which does not require the ability to swim or find a mate. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a microphone boom is likely to be present at a specific type of event, and that event is related to the stock market. This immediately eliminates options like concert, gig, and recording studio, which are not typically associated with stock market events. TV studios are commonly used to broadcast live events, including stock market events, and New York is a major financial center where many such events take place. However, the sentence only suggests a likelihood, so the answer cannot be determined with complete certainty without further information.
The question suggests that something important is happening to John, which is likely to evoke a positive emotion. The choice "being happy" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the most commonly associated emotion with receiving or achieving something important. The other options, such as "headaches" and "wanting more," do not align with the context of the sentence and are not likely to be related to the emotion that John is feeling. The choice "stoic" also does not fit, as it refers to a person being unemotional and not showing any feelings.
The sentence suggests that James made a decision about how the AI should be raised based on his belief that a religious upbringing would have negative consequences. The other options (eternal, unpredictable, holy, and monastic) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the owner is restricting the kitten's access to certain areas of the house, specifically the bedroom. Therefore, the correct answer would be "closed" as this implies that the owner is keeping the door shut to prevent the kitten from entering the room. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "opened" contradicts the idea of restricting access while "found at shower" and "falling down" are unrelated to the sentence. "Locked" is a possibility, but is not explicitly stated and "closed" is the more common way of restricting a pet's access to a specific room.
The sentence implies that whatever happens to cats every day is a regular and necessary part of their routine. Cats, like all animals, need water to survive, and therefore it makes sense that they would drink water every day. While some cats may enjoy playing or annoying others, these actions are not necessary for their survival and do not happen every day for all cats. The other options, such as opening doors or needing food, could happen every day for some cats but are not as universal as drinking water.
The sentence implies that the person had a job where they danced and waved an advertisement outside of somewhere. This suggests that they were hired to attract attention to a particular store or business. The other options (advertisement, magazine, web page, bus) do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they are not physical locations where someone could dance and wave an advertisement.
The question asks what activity is related to listening to music. Out of the given choices, only "play piano" directly relates to listening to music. Skating and having fun are not related to music, and "fiddle" is a musical instrument, but the question does not specify if the person knows how to play it or if it involves listening to already recorded music.
A teakettle is a small kitchen appliance used for boiling water, typically used to make tea or coffee. It is usually kept on the countertop for easy access when a hot beverage is desired. While it is possible to keep a teakettle in a cupboard, it would not be the most convenient location for frequent use. Water and hardware department have no connection to the question, while England is a location and not a place to store a teakettle.
Bleachers are typically associated with outdoor sports events where spectators need to sit on a temporary structure. Movies, opera, and theater commonly have permanent seating with individual seats. Lecture halls may have fixed seating arrangements, but they are not typically referred to as bleachers. Therefore, the option that best fits the description of bleachers is a hockey game, or any outdoor sports event.
The sentence suggests that someone has a broken leg and needs to elevate it. The most logical place for them to do this would be on a hospital bed, as this is where medical care is typically provided and where patients can receive treatment for a broken leg. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "Why did the chicken cross the road?" is a famous joke, and the punchline is "To get to the other side." Therefore, the answer is "cross road." The other options are not related to the joke or the behavior of chickens in the joke.
The sentence suggests that researchers were seeking something urgently in response to the fast-spreading disease. "Cure" is the most likely answer as it refers to a solution for a disease. The other options ("cause spots on leaf," "healthy," "wellness," and "ball stopped") are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information to help answer the question.
The sentence mentions "a vehicle on rails," which indicates that the location is likely related to trains or rail transportation. The specific activity of reading magazines while waiting further suggests a place where people wait for trains, such as a train station. The other options, such as vegetables or a doctor's office, do not have any connection to rail transportation or waiting for a vehicle on rails.
The question is asking about a common skin condition that affects the feet, specifically the heels. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions being near the coast, which suggests that seafood is likely readily available. The phrase "relieve your hunger" implies a need for sustenance, which can be satisfied by eating fish. The other options either do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are less likely to be available near the coast.
Electrical connections are typically found in walls, as wires are run through the walls to connect outlets and switches. The other options have no connection to electrical connections or the context of the sentence.
The phrase "silver screen" is commonly used to refer to the medium of movies, which were originally shown on a screen made of silver. This phrase is rarely used to describe other types of performances, such as plays, theater productions, or television shows. Therefore, the correct answer is "movies."
The sentence suggests that the person had an index card that they needed to return, which is a common item found in libraries' card catalogues. The purpose of a card catalog is to help library patrons find and locate specific books, so it is logical that the index card would have been returned to the card catalogue once the person found the book they needed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shelf is unstable, which indicates that it may be leaning or wobbling. The carpenter would need to identify which part of the shelf is causing the instability and fix that component. Given that the sentence specified "corner", it is likely that this is the area of the shelf that requires attention to stabilize it. None of the other options provided are directly related to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Jan went to an actual theater to listen to a speech. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context and therefore are not likely answers to the question.
The sentence implies that there is a monster that the beauty loves, and the word "nickname" suggests that the monster is commonly referred to by a certain name. The word "beauty" may be a reference to the fairytale "Beauty and the Beast," in which the protagonist falls in love with a beast. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "beast." The other options (ugly, ugliness, satellite, top of mountain) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the coffee mug has been washed and dried, indicating that it is ready to be put away. The most logical place to put a dry mug would be on a shelf, as this is a common storage location for cups and other dishes. The other options, such as "desktop" or "kitchen," do not provide a clear indication of where the mug should be placed in relation to other objects or surfaces.
The question is asking where all participants are likely to need sports equipment, which suggests that the context is related to sports. Dicks Sporting Goods and Sears are both stores that sell sporting equipment, but mall does not specifically indicate any stores that sell sports equipment. Sporting event could be a possible answer, but it does not necessarily mean that all participants will need sports equipment as some may just be spectators. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a sporting goods store, which is a location dedicated to selling sports equipment for all participants.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker needed to go to a place to purchase canned food items to contribute to a food drive. The grocery store is the most logical choice as it is a location where one can purchase a variety of canned food items. The other options, such as a shelf or cupboard, suggest locations within one's own home where canned goods might be stored, but not purchased. The cellar and refrigerator may contain canned goods, but not to the extent that a grocery store would.
In London, telephone booths are famously painted red, while in other places like the United States, they are often gray or in other colors. This is a distinct feature of London's landscape and culture that sets it apart from other cities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Since John is in a wheelchair, he would not be able to use the stairs to reach the third floor. The other options, such as the space shuttle and downtown, are not applicable to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be the elevator, which is typically used for vertical transportation in multi-story buildings and would be accessible for someone in a wheelchair.
The context suggests that the mother is wrapping gifts in preparation for Christmas. The most common place to put wrapped gifts during the holiday season is under a Christmas tree. The other options, such as department store or specialty store, do not make sense in relation to the mother wrapping gifts. A Frazier fir is a type of Christmas tree, but it does not fit logically in this sentence. A Christmas stocking is typically hung up and not used to store wrapped gifts.
The sentence suggests that the wheel was loose and in danger of falling off when something specific was happening. The word "fast" indicates that the wheel was in danger of falling off when going quickly, implying that the object it was attached to was in motion. The other options do not provide any clarity on what action caused the wheel to become loose.
The question suggests that the person in question is causing harm without intending to, which would likely lead to feelings of remorse or regret. Empowering and glee are unlikely emotions in this context, while despair and sadness may be too extreme for someone who is simply unable to stop unintentionally causing harm.
The sentence suggests that someone's mail has been stolen, and specifically mentions letters that had been delivered. The most likely location for this to occur is a mail box, where letters are often left for delivery. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the physical contact between the man and woman resulted in a physiological response, which is typically associated with sexual arousal. The option "erections" is the most likely physiological result in this context, while the other choices are not relevant or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the teams were equally skilled and competitive, which creates an expectation among spectators about who will emerge victorious. Spectators are likely interested in whether one team will win or both will end in a draw, which is why winning or losing is the correct answer. Envy and resentment do not relate to the context of the sentence, while one winner and two winners do not make sense since there are only two teams competing.
The capitalization of "House" suggests that it is a proper noun and likely refers to a specific institution or group. The mention of Sally being a senior indicates that this institution or group has some sort of hierarchical structure, which is commonly found in high schools and colleges. The other options - assisted living facility, old people's home, and republican party - do not fit the context of a senior in the House. "Organization" could potentially fit, but it is too vague without additional context.
Skyscrapers are tall buildings that typically have many floors and are designed to accommodate a large number of offices. New York is known for its skyline of skyscrapers, many of which house a variety of businesses and offices. The other options (school building, grocery store) are unlikely locations for offices, and "work" and "business" are too general to provide a clear answer.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was originally going to stay in a small cabin, and that they were then upgraded to something larger or more luxurious. The options "spacecraft," "hall," and "palace" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are all significantly larger than a cabin. "Hotel" could be a possibility, but "villa" is a more likely choice given that it suggests a higher level of luxury and comfort than a typical hotel room.
The sentence states that Johnny is looking for blowfish in places that aren't near America. Therefore, we can eliminate Gulf of Mexico and Hawaiian waters as they are located in or near America. The other options remain, but tropical sea is too vague a description and could refer to multiple locations. Therefore, the best answer is South Pacific Ocean, which is a specific location known for its diverse marine life, including blowfish.
The question specifies that John is traveling on a highway heading South from Texas without stopping. Since Mexico is located to the South of Texas, it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as developed land, desert, United States, and Oklahoma do not provide information that would lead to a logical conclusion as to where John will end up.
The sentence implies that the person did not expect the idea to become reality, indicating that they did not think it would happen. The word "finally" suggests that they had been working towards this idea for some time, and it was unexpected for it to come to fruition. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a projector and a huge screen, which are commonly associated with showing movies. Additionally, the fact that the audience is laughing suggests that they are likely watching something entertaining, which is another characteristic commonly associated with movies. The other options, such as theatre or conference, do not necessarily imply that the audience would be laughing or that a projector and screen would be present.
The sentence suggests that the item in question was once considered cutting edge technology, and that people now use "smart" versions of it. This is a common way of referring to the development of technology over time. The options "mobile phone," "briefcase," "office," and "desktop" are all more modern inventions and do not fit the historical context suggested by the sentence. A calculator that fits on a wristwatch, however, was a major technological breakthrough when it was first introduced.
Taking a shower after exercise, such as running, can help you feel refreshed and rejuvenated. It can also help to cool your body down and reduce sweating. The other options, such as becoming tired or experiencing leg cramps, are not typical outcomes of taking a shower after exercise.
The sentence implies that the negative effect being referred to is not related to the spouses themselves, but rather to someone else impacted by the divorce. The options "no spouse" and "lose money" may be negative consequences for one of the spouses, but not for someone else. "Lot of grief" and "depression" could be experienced by anyone involved in the divorce, not just someone other than a spouse. Therefore, the option "children suffer" is most likely the correct answer as children are often deeply affected by their parents' divorce, both emotionally and in other ways such as their living arrangements and financial stability.
The question mentions a tower that is used to transmit signals. This is a common feature of radio stations, as they need to broadcast their signals over a large area. The other options are not likely to have towers specifically for signal transmission, and are not directly related to the context of the question.
The sentence states that the friend lives close to you, which implies that meeting up should also be in a nearby location. Among the choices, the neighbor's house is the most likely option as they live close by. The other options are unlikely to be the correct answer because they do not provide a clear indication of a nearby location.
The sentence suggests that regardless of a person's background, they deserve to be treated equally when applying for a job. This means that the hiring process should be fair and unbiased so that everyone has an equal chance of being hired based on their qualifications and skills. The other options, such as critical thinking, congratulated, compliments, and raffle tickets, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information in answering the question.
The sentence suggests that James is likely in a location where he would have access to a desk or workspace, such as a home or office. A desk drawer would be a logical place to store a pencil sharpener in this context. The other options do not have a clear association with storing office supplies. A cabinet could be used to store a variety of items, a library would not typically have office supplies, a nightstand is typically used for personal items, and a stationery store would require James to leave his current location to find a sharpener.
The sentence suggests that the crab was having difficulty moving and was "strained." This could be due to an obstacle in its path, such as sand, which could impede its movement. Tide pools, current, and cooking pots do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be obstacles in the crab's path.
A pantry is a specific type of storage space typically used for storing food items, including dishes. In many homes, pantries are located near the kitchen and are designed to keep dishes organized and easily accessible. On the other hand, shelves can be used to store both dishes and books, as can a living room, table, or apartment depending on the individual's preferences and living arrangements.
The sentence suggests that grooming may sometimes take longer than expected. In such a case, the next appointment may be delayed, indicating that the correct answer is "late." The other options, such as "injury," "beauty," "mistakes," and "annoyed," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that James is interested in outer space and specifically mentions that he loves the idea of going to Mars. This suggests that James is interested in space travel and would ideally want to reach Mars on a spacecraft. The other options, such as love, zoo, school, and library, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The other choices do not fit the concept of putting something in a container. A cargo ship is a vessel for transporting large quantities of goods, and a port is a location for ships to dock. A refrigerator is used for storing food, but it is not a container. A closet and garage are spaces to store items, but not necessarily in a container. Therefore, the correct answer is food, as it is something that can be placed in a container for transport or storage.
The sentence suggests that parents yell when there is chaos to exert control over their children's behavior. Yelling may be a way for parents to assert authority and get their children to follow directions, especially in situations where there is a lot of noise or activity. The other options do not match the context of the sentence as well – guiding, understanding, caring for, or venting anger are not necessarily associated with yelling in times of chaos.
The sentence mentions needing a coat if it is cold, which suggests that the location is outdoors. Among the options, a bus stop is an outdoor location where people often stand in line and may need a coat in cold weather. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James was searching for a place to buy bitcoins, which is typically done through online exchanges or websites. The other options, such as a bar or cafe, do not make sense in this context as they are not commonly associated with buying and selling digital currency.
Casinos have strict rules and regulations when it comes to gambling. Counting cards is considered cheating and is illegal in many casinos. This practice involves keeping track of the cards that have been dealt, enabling the player to better predict which cards will be dealt next. This increases the player's chances of winning and is seen as an unfair advantage against the house. Remembering, helping, winning, and dealing are not necessarily illegal, depending on the circumstances and rules of the particular game.
Strip malls often contain a variety of shops and businesses, including beauty salons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Parks are often public spaces where people gather and spend time, making them a common location for trash cans. Additionally, parks usually have designated areas for waste disposal in order to keep the space clean and enjoyable for everyone. The other options may have trash cans, but parks are the most likely choice based on the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the notepad is small enough to be stored on your person, which rules out options such as home and school. The word "meeting" could potentially suggest a briefcase or bag, but there is no clear indication that the notepad needs to be taken to a meeting specifically. The phrase "on your person" implies that the notepad needs to be easily accessible, which makes the back pocket a logical choice. The drug store has no relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that judging pigs is a process that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Evaluating is a more appropriate term in this context because it implies a comprehensive assessment of the pigs' qualities and characteristics. Verdict suggests a final decision, but judging is an ongoing process. Responsibility is not specific enough to the context of the sentence, and prejudice implies a biased perspective, which would not be appropriate in a fair judging competition.
Civil actions are typically initiated by individuals who feel wronged and seek justice or compensation. Anger is a common emotion that may motivate someone to take legal action, as they may feel that their rights have been violated or they have suffered some form of injustice. Complications and tiredness do not typically lead to civil action, and trial and court case are more specific steps within the legal process rather than emotions or motivations.
The sentence suggests that John is opposed to animal abuse and loves animals, which could make him hesitant to go to a pet store. Pet stores have been criticized for mistreating animals, so John may avoid visiting them to avoid supporting this kind of abuse. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Reading a newspaper is usually considered a way to stay informed about local and global events, and to gain knowledge about various topics. The phrase "gives you" suggests that the correct answer should indicate a positive outcome (i.e. gaining something), rather than a negative one (i.e. getting angry). "Education" is the most appropriate choice, as it implies that reading a newspaper can broaden your understanding of current events and increase your knowledge of the world around you. "Concern" and "worrie" are similar in meaning, both indicating a feeling of worry or unease, but they do not accurately reflect the positive benefits of reading a newspaper. "Learning about world" is also a possible choice, but it is more general and less specific to the question of local current events.
The sentence suggests that the lady was doing a one man show, which means she was performing alone. When a performer takes center stage, it means they move to the main area where all attention is focused on them, typically the middle of the stage. This is a common phrase used in theater and performance to indicate that the performer is starting their performance. The other options do not make sense in this context - "persuade", "challenge", and "speak clearly" suggest actions during a performance, but not necessarily at the beginning, while "slept" is clearly an incorrect option.
Fishing rods are equipment used for fishing and are commonly sold in sporting goods stores. Furniture stores do not typically sell fishing equipment, nor do hardware stores, which specialize in hardware and construction tools. While a fishing camp may sell fishing rods, it is not a common place for consumers to purchase them. Engines do not have any relation to fishing equipment.
The sentence suggests that if Ali bumps into the speaker while they are walking, they should do something specific. The correct answer is "slow down" because if someone bumps into you while walking, it's likely because they need to slow down and watch where they're going. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person is watching TV to pass their time and find something to occupy themselves, which is typically associated with seeking entertainment. The other options (erections, boredom, getting fat, sadness) do not seem to be appropriate options for what someone might expect to get from watching TV in this context.
The question is asking where you would store a shopping bag if all the seats in your vehicle are full, which suggests that you are transporting the shopping bag in your vehicle. The car trunk is a common storage area for items in a vehicle and is designed for keeping items secure and out of sight. The other options, such as the roof or a retail store, are not relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence specifically mentions a temple, which is typically associated with religious sites. Jerusalem is known as a holy city for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and has a rich history of religious architecture, including the Temple Mount. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "passenger" implies that the question refers to people who are traveling in an airplane, rather than pilots or crew members who might be flying or landing the plane. The sentence also mentions that people are waiting to use electronics, which suggests that they have already boarded the plane. Reading is a common activity for people to do on planes, especially during takeoff and landing when electronic devices have to be turned off. Buying tickets is also not relevant to the question, as that is done before boarding the plane.
The sentence suggests that someone who has attended school for twelve years is expected to do something specific afterwards. One possible outcome is to "graduate," which means to receive a diploma or certificate of completion after finishing a program of study. The other options, such as "inspiration," "much work," and "boredom," do not make sense in this context and are unlikely to be the correct answer. "Degree" is a related term, but it does not necessarily imply that someone has completed a program of study and may not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is yelling after getting a bruise, which indicates a physical sensation. The options "self pity," "communication," and "embarrassment" do not directly relate to physical pain. "Understood" may suggest that the person's pain is being acknowledged, but it is not a clear answer on its own. Therefore, "pain" is the most fitting option.
The word "helm" is related to steering or controlling a vessel. The fact that the sentence mentions the helm moving the masts suggests that it is a device used on sailing vessels, which use masts to power their movement. The other options may not have masts or may use alternative methods of propulsion that do not involve masts, making them less likely choices.
The question is asking for a location to store a wind instrument in your home. The most logical answer would be a room dedicated to music, such as a music room, as it would likely have proper storage and conditions for musical instruments. The other options, such as under a bed or at a symphony, do not make sense in the context of the question. The option for a music store also doesn't make sense as the question is asking for a location in your home, not a store outside of your home.
The sentence suggests that someone delivers the morning paper to your home, which is a common practice for newspapers. The choices are all different locations, but only the front porch is a place where someone would typically deliver a newspaper to your home. The other options, such as a classroom, synagogue, bathroom or grocery store, do not have any connection to receiving a newspaper delivery.
Speech therapists work with individuals to improve their ability to communicate effectively. This can involve working on a wide range of skills, such as articulation, fluency, and language development. The option "complete sentences" is the most closely related to this definition, as forming complete sentences is a fundamental aspect of effective communication. The other options do not have any clear connection to the role of a speech therapist.
The sentence suggests that the reason John disliked mosquitoes is not because they suck blood, but because they make a particular noise. Mosquitoes are known for their high-pitched buzzing sound, which is often associated with irritation and annoyance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person curled up under a blanket to get warm, which is a common behavior when someone is feeling chilly. The addition of "feel more comfortable" implies that the action of curling up under the blanket accomplished its goal of making the person feel more at ease. The other options (sleep, sweating, blush, cuddle) do not match the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence mentions that the blowfish was found off the coast of the Carolina's, which are located near the Atlantic Ocean. The other options do not have any connection to the location mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, blowfish are commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean, which further supports the answer choice.
The sentence suggests that the person was doing favors for their coworkers and was frustrated that they were not receiving anything in return. The word "gratitude" is the most fitting option as it refers to the feeling of being grateful for someone's actions. The other options do not directly match the context of the sentence. "Let down" and "disappointment" would be more suitable if the person had expectations that were not met. "Respect" would be more appropriate if the person was looking for recognition, and "illness" and "satisfaction" do not fit the context.
The sentence suggests that the family was playing cards for leisure or enjoyment. The use of the word "playing" suggests that the activity was not a serious one, and the absence of any mention of gambling or money indicates that the family was not playing to win or lose anything. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "having fun".
The verb "moving" indicates that cars are in motion, which typically involves someone driving the car. The other options, such as "road," "getting tired," "accidents," and "ticket," may be related to the concept of driving, but they do not fully capture the action of moving cars.
A rural area generally refers to a region that is characterized by a low population density, with most people residing in small communities or villages. Therefore, it is more likely for a large village to be located in a rural area rather than a big city, suburbs, or a specific state like Ohio. The term countryside also refers to a rural area, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of a large village.
The sentence suggests that the business has a requirement for people entering their store. One common requirement for most stores is that customers must wear shoes for hygiene and safety reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to a store's requirements.

A binder containing homework assignments is typically owned and carried by a student, who would most likely keep it in their backpack. The other options do not fit the context of the question as well. A bookcase is where books are kept, not typically school supplies. An office supply store may sell binders, but it would not be the location of the actual binder containing the homework assignments. An office or classroom may have a binder containing assignments, but it would not be the most common location for a student to find their own binder.
The description of Shane's behavior as "ridiculous" and "cheerful" suggests that it was not appropriate for the somber and serious occasion of a funeral. The word "somber" means serious and solemn, which is more in line with what people typically expect at a funeral. The other options do not fit with the context of a funeral or the tone conveyed in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the college kids were lacking in design aesthetic when it came to decorating their living space. The fact that they used a folding chair inside their room suggests that they may not have had enough furniture or were using makeshift items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence provides geographic information that the department store is located in the Northwest USA. New York and big city are not in the Northwest region, while town and shopping mall are not specific enough to determine a location. Idaho is a state in the Northwest region, so it is the best choice.
Blinking lights in the air at night are typically associated with airplanes. Planes use flashing lights to communicate their position and help prevent collisions. The other options do not make sense in the context of blinking lights in the air at night.
The sentence suggests that the monkey is being used for scientific research, which is commonly conducted in research laboratories. The people wearing white coats also support this idea, as scientists often wear lab coats in a research setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to put a table in their house, which implies that they need an indoor space for it. Libraries and demonstrations are public spaces that are unlikely to have furniture like a table, while a football ground is an outdoor space. A rug is also not a suitable option as it is a floor covering, not a container for a table. A corner of a room, however, is a common location to place a table, making it the most likely answer.
Animals engage in a variety of behaviors that John may be interested in studying, but observing them bathing is a common and important behavior to track. Bathing can help animals maintain their hygiene, regulate their body temperature, and even reduce stress. The other options either do not relate to observable behaviors or are less commonly studied in animal behavior research.
The sentence suggests that Sarah believed she had been at home all evening, implying that she did not leave during that time. Therefore, the only time for her to have left would have been after evening, which is the night. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they occur prior to the evening or are too similar to evening (i.e., daytime).
The sentence implies that the location where the tool is kept is downstairs, which eliminates the options of hardware store, garage, repair shop, and the library. The only remaining option is the basement, which is commonly located below ground level in a house or building.
Potatoes are a common ingredient used in stews, and they are typically stored in a cool, dry place like a pantry. The other options (restaurants, casserole, root cellar, pockets) do not make sense in this context.
The word "only some" suggests that not all types of police carry weapons. In many countries, only certain specialized units or officers with specific responsibilities, such as detectives or SWAT team members, are authorized to carry firearms. The other options, such as directing traffic or helping people, could apply to a wider range of police officers.
The sentence suggests that the grandpa does not know how to read, which is commonly referred to as being illiterate. The child wants to teach his grandpa to read because he believes it is wrong for someone to go through life without this basic skill. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The word "traditionally" suggests that the answer is something that has been used for a long time to gather information about the world. While books and television are also common sources of information, newspapers have a long history of being a primary source for daily news updates. Meetings and guides may provide information, but they are not typically sources for general knowledge about the world.
The sentence suggests that the temperature is increasing rapidly because the sun is out. "Heat up" is the only choice that accurately reflects this idea. "Cool down" and "drop to zero" are contradictory to the sentence, while "dropping quickly" and "increase" are too vague and don't accurately capture the idea of the temperature rising rapidly.
The sentence suggests that the person doesn't like the smell of something, and would rather spray themselves with water than be near it. The only option that fits this context is perfume, as it is a scented product that could potentially be disliked by someone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Competence in school work typically refers to a student's ability to meet the academic expectations of their classes, which includes achieving passing grades. While compliments and intellectual challenges could potentially be received by a competent student, they are not necessarily guaranteed or directly related to competence. Stickers may be given as a reward system in some classrooms, but they are not a direct result of academic competence. Avoiding pain is not related to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that lizards need the sun's heat to regulate their body temperature, which is why they will be found on a specific object. Rocks are a common object that lizards will lay on to bask in the sun and absorb its heat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man is looking for deodorant, which is typically stored in a bathroom or medicine cabinet. The wife's response indicates that she expects the deodorant to be in a specific location, so the medicine chest is the most likely choice. The other options are less likely because they either do not relate to where deodorant is typically stored or because they do not provide enough information to make an informed choice.
The question asks what a person can do to get good grades, which implies that the person needs to take some action to achieve their goal. The option "try to learn" is the most logical answer because it suggests that the person needs to put in effort and work hard to understand and master the material they are studying. The other options are not as relevant or helpful in improving one's academic performance.
The sentence suggests that there is not enough seating for everyone, which implies that a group of people will not be able to comfortably sit together. Of the given options, a meeting is the most likely event that would require seating for a group of people. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Shadows are created when an object blocks the path of light, causing a darker area to appear behind it. Since the ground is the most common surface that objects are placed on, it is also the most common place where shadows appear. The other options might also create shadows, but they are less likely to be the first place someone thinks of when considering where shadows are typically seen.
The sentence suggests that when we receive something and feel grateful, we typically express our gratitude in a certain way. "Show appreciation" is the option that best matches this idea. Saying "thank you" is a common way of showing appreciation, but it is not one of the options given. Smiling and looking for more are not necessarily actions associated with expressing gratitude, so they can be ruled out.
The question is asking about activities that can occur in the mind while sleeping. Dreams are commonly associated with the sleeping mind, which is supported by the phrase "might dream" in the answers. Snoring and talking are physical actions that can occur during sleep, but the question is specifically asking about mental activities. Getting cold is a physical sensation and not related to the mind. "Nothing" is too vague and does not provide any useful information to help answer the question.
In grammar, a conjunction is a part of speech that connects words or groups of words together. Therefore, when combining two words, a conjunction is the appropriate preposition to use, such as "and," "or," or "but." The other options (article, adjective, interjection, pronoun) do not serve this purpose.
The sentence suggests that George intentionally, or "knowingly," ruined the surprise. The other options do not imply intentionality, which is necessary to match the context of the sentence. Hiding, accidentally, and expectation all suggest that George may have stumbled into ruining the surprise. Planned, while it does suggest intentionality, does not match the tense of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that to create a positive change in society, one must start from within themselves. This is often associated with the idea of self-improvement, personal growth, and making changes to oneself before trying to make changes in the world. The other options listed do not necessarily relate to this idea, and in some cases may even have a negative effect on creating positive change. For example, riots are usually associated with violence and destruction and may not result in any positive change or solutions.
The use of the term "heifer" suggests that we are talking about a female cow that has not yet given birth. New Hampshire is known for its dairy industry, so taking a heifer there would likely lead to a dairy farm or farm field. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking for the most likely place within your home to store birth control pills, and the option "medicine cabinet" is the most logical choice. Medicine cabinets are typically used for storing medications and other healthcare products, making them a convenient and easily accessible location for birth control pills. The other options, such as "chemist's shop" and "drug store," are external locations that would not typically be found in a person's home.
Fish are aquatic animals and thus spend the majority of their time in bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, rivers and streams. Out of the given options, only 'body of water' and 'underwater' are related to the habitat of fish. 'Lake Superior' is a specific body of water, but not all fish live in Lake Superior, so it is not the correct answer. 'Toilet' is not a natural body of water, while 'aquarium' is a man-made enclosure where fish are kept in captivity.
The sentence suggests that the act of jogging all day can have negative consequences on your feet. Blisters are a common ailment associated with prolonged physical activity, especially when wearing ill-fitting footwear or not using adequate protection. The other options do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that the sugary beverage being referred to contains water as one of its key ingredients. Mountain dew, glass, whirlpool bath, and coffee cup are not drinks and do not fit the context of the question. "Soft drink" is a common term for carbonated, sugary beverages that are typically made with water and other ingredients such as corn syrup and flavorings.
Schools are commonly located in residential neighborhoods, as they serve the local community and are often within walking distance of students' homes. Mosques are religious centers, not necessarily educational ones. While schools are found in many cities, the sentence suggests a specific type of location. Prague is a city, but the sentence does not provide any information about schools in Prague specifically. "Community" is too vague and could refer to any type of location.
The sentence suggests that the woman enjoyed having her friends over to her home on Fridays. This is indicated by the phrase "open invitation" and the fact that she "loved to host." The correct answer is therefore likely to relate to hosting or entertaining guests, which is represented by the option "entertain." The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the context is about the institution where slaves did labor work in the South, thus the correct answer is plantation. Plantation is commonly associated with the history of slavery in the Southern United States, where slaves were forced to work in large farms owned by wealthy landowners. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions "papers for work or school," which suggests that the answer is an item commonly used in academic or professional settings. "Street," "obesity," and "living room" do not have any clear connection to storing papers. "Office suite" might be a valid answer, but it refers to a grouping of rooms rather than a specific item used for organizing papers, making "binder" the most likely choice.
A notebook is a common item found in bookstores as they typically carry school and office supplies. Backpacks are a type of bag, not a place to purchase a notebook. Abraham Lincoln's grave is a historical landmark and not a place to purchase a notebook either. Desktops are computers and not a place to purchase a physical notebook. Classrooms may have notebooks available for purchase, but they are not the primary location for purchasing them.
The sentence suggests that the monkey was performing in a circus, which is commonly associated with zoos, where animals are trained to perform for entertainment. The conductor's comment also further supports the idea that the monkey was in a zoo setting, as he jokes about the monkey's "work" there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that owning something increases the likelihood of encountering spiders. A shed, which is an outdoor storage structure, is more likely to have spiders than a meadow or a cupboard. A mail box and a cellar are typically indoors, and are less likely to have spiders.
The word "captive" suggests that the monkey is in some form of captivity or captivity-like setting, which typically refers to places such as zoological gardens or wildlife reserves. Rain forests and tree tops are natural habitats for monkeys and they would not be considered captive in these locations. Toy stores and the great outdoors are also unlikely places to find captive monkeys.
The sentence suggests that driving too fast on an icy road is a negative behavior that could lead to harmful consequences. The word "dangerous" is the best fit as it directly relates to the consequences of the behavior described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior or its potential consequences.
The context of the sentence implies that someone is discussing the idea that ignorance cannot be used as a defense for committing a crime. In this context, the word "judge" makes the most sense as they are the individual who would be responsible for determining whether ignorance is a valid excuse in a court of law. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Learn about subject" and "learn new" are both related to acquiring knowledge, but they do not specifically relate to the legal concept of ignorance as a defense. "Find truth" suggests a search for information, but it does not necessarily relate to the concept of ignorance in the legal context. "Is bliss" is a common phrase that implies that not knowing something may be better than knowing it, but it does not relate to the context of the sentence.
A yard is a unit of measurement that typically refers to three feet. This is a commonly-known measurement and is the most logical answer among the options given. The other options do not relate to the context of the question, which is asking about what comprises a yard.
The word "outgoing" is commonly used to describe someone who is sociable, extroverted, and enjoys being around people. People who are outgoing tend to seek out new experiences and social opportunities because they enjoy interacting with others. Playfulness may also be a characteristic of an outgoing person, but it is not as strongly associated with the term as seeking new experiences. "Own house", "good looking", and "beautiful" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The verb "dissipate" means to gradually disappear or be used up. Therefore, it makes sense that this would be the correct answer to the question, as money tends to be used up and eventually disappear. The other answer choices, such as "flown," "disintegrate," and "fall apart," do not accurately describe what happens to money after it is used up. "Penultimate" is irrelevant to the question, as it refers to something second-to-last, which does not relate to what happens to money.
Fort Knox is a military base in Kentucky that is famously known for housing the United States Bullion Depository, which stores a significant portion of the nation's gold reserves. The other answer choices do not have any connection to gold reserves or the U.S. government.
The keyword in the question is "primary duty," which suggests that the answer will be related to the most important responsibility of a parent. The other options may be important as well, but they do not necessarily represent the primary duty of a parent. "Care for children" is a common phrase that encompasses a wide range of responsibilities, including providing for their physical needs, ensuring their safety, nurturing their emotional development, and supporting their education. The other options, such as "speak freely" or "control children," do not accurately reflect the primary role of a parent.
The question implies that the audience is particularly loud and enthusiastic at a certain type of event. This is a common characteristic of sports games, especially those with high levels of physical activity, such as hockey. Show, theatre, movies and event don't typically involve the same level of vocal participation from the audience, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence describes a location where one can find both food options and a variety of stores. A shopping center typically contains a food court or restaurants, as well as a range of shops selling various goods. The other options do not necessarily offer both food and shopping options in one place, except for a downtown area which might have many different stores and restaurants but is not as specific as a shopping center.
The sentence suggests that there might be a problem with the electrical connection, and the word "wires" is most closely associated with electrical connections. The other options - company, telephone network, airport, and freeway - do not have any clear relevance to electrical equipment.
The sentence suggests that children may become confused while walking home and end up at the wrong location. The option "wrong house" is a logical choice as it directly relates to the situation described in the sentence. The other options have no clear relevance to the situation of children getting lost while walking home.
The word "seeks" indicates that the government is actively trying to obtain something from its people. The options "country", "city", and "sun" do not make sense in the context of a government seeking something over its people. "Trouble" may be a possibility, but it is not commonly associated with a government's relationship with its citizens. "Control", on the other hand, is a frequently used term to describe the power that a government exercises over its people.
The context of the sentence implies that the reason for reading the letter is to obtain news or information from a friend who is overseas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the canned food is being stored in the kitchen, and specifically above the sink. The most logical choice for storage in this context would be a cupboard, which is a type of cabinet that is commonly found in kitchens and used to store various items, including non-perishable food. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as an oven is used for cooking, a grocery store is a place to purchase food, a pantry is a separate room or designated storage area, and a cellar is typically used for storing wine or other perishable goods.
The sentence is discussing a graveyard, which is typically referred to as a cemetery. The options "Arlington" and "church property" imply specific locations, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest those locations are relevant. "Out back" and "every town" are too vague to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the people were looking for a scenic route, which indicates that they wanted to enjoy natural beauty. The option "countryside" is more likely to offer such views, as it typically refers to rural areas with open fields, farms, and natural landscapes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some of them (like "developed land" or "atlas") might even suggest the opposite of scenic beauty.
The sentence suggests that the performer is entertaining friends at a casual setting, which is commonly associated with a social gathering or party. The other options, such as cinema, opera, stage or dance, are typically more formal settings where performers are hired to put on a show for an audience.
The term "motorway" is commonly used in England to refer to a high-speed road designed for motor vehicles only, similar to what is known as a freeway or expressway in other parts of the world. Scotland is part of the UK but has its own distinct road network terminology, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Europe is a broad region with many different countries and road systems. A race track is not a type of public road. While New Jersey has highways, the term "motorway" is not commonly used in the US.
The opposite of hosting a crowd would be having just one person, or a single person, in attendance. The other options do not relate to the concept of hosting or being social in any way, and are therefore not viable answer choices for this question.
The sentence suggests that the person is applying for a job, which implies that they are seeking "employment." "Work" and "income" are related concepts, but they do not specifically refer to the act of seeking a job. "Hope" and "offer" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "called bull" is often used to mean calling out a lie or falsehood. In this context, the friend made a claim about bulls that the person didn't believe to be true. The phrase "bullbleep" is a slang term that means nonsense or foolishness, which fits with the idea that the person didn't believe their friend's claim. The other options do not fit with the context or meaning of the sentence.
Compassionate and thoughtful are both adjectives that are often associated with kindness and empathy towards others. Therefore, it can be inferred that compassionate thoughtful behavior would be described as kind. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that fighting inflation is important because if it is not successful, something negative could happen. The term "inflation" refers to a general increase in prices and a decrease in the purchasing value of money. If inflation is not controlled or reduced, it can lead to economic instability, which can manifest as things like recessions, high unemployment rates, and decreased economic growth. The other options, such as "not noticeable" and "eat cake," do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the group is at an amusement park and took a break to have lunch. While eating, they discussed their plans for the next ride. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they were talking about having fun on the next ride. The other options, such as heartburn, gas, and food poisoning, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be what the group was discussing.
The sentence states that James drove his niece to her father, which implies that the father is James' brother. Therefore, the correct answer is brother's house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not match the relationship between James and his niece's father.
The sentence suggests that the teachers are preparing their classrooms, which often involves unpacking and setting up materials. Therefore, the most relevant answer choice is "open boxes." The other options do not relate to the task of setting up a classroom, such as "talking too much" or "teaching children," which are part of a teacher's regular duties. "Answering questions" and "giving homework" may also be tasks teachers do, but they don't relate directly to preparing a classroom.
The first part of the sentence says "We do not have rest," which implies that the people are not getting any breaks or time to relax. This would likely lead to feelings of exhaustion or fatigue. The other options, such as feeling lonely or feeling better, do not relate as directly to the lack of rest mentioned in the sentence.
Fast food restaurants are known for providing quick and convenient food options that can be purchased and eaten at tables within the establishment. The other options listed do not typically provide food and tables for customers to eat at. Houses are typically private residences where people live, not places of business. Libraries and conferences are places for learning and networking, respectively, and do not typically provide food and tables for customers. Paper is a material used for writing and printing, not a location for eating.
Bookstores typically sell books and other reading materials, including magazines. Carpeting and applesauce are not typically sold in bookstores, and a strip mall or city is not a specific product that can be purchased in a store.
The sentence suggests that the act of socializing by engaging in trivial conversations has a specific name. "Small talk" is a commonly used phrase to describe this kind of conversation that is meant to be light and casual, rather than deep or meaningful. The other options either do not relate to the act of engaging in small talk or are too broad in their scope to accurately describe this particular behavior.
The sentence suggests that the kids had been having fun for an extended period of time, indicating that they may be tired and in need of rest. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence. A wild ride or massive bear would be unexpected and not indicated by the sentence, and playing marbles or constructing do not relate to the idea of needing rest.
The sentence suggests that Sarah made a mistake and ingested something that she thought was safe and meant for consumption. Given that the sentence mentions the word "cabinet," it is likely that the substance was stored alongside other household items, potentially including medication. The context implies that Sarah was intending to take medicine, and mistakenly ingested poison instead. The other options, such as junk food or nutrient, are not likely to have been stored in a cabinet and would therefore be less likely to be confused with medicine.
The sentence suggests that the sales tactics in some stores are designed to make women think they are getting a good deal, and one common tactic is to make it seem like buying more products will result in a greater discount or savings. Therefore, the correct answer is "save money." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Seeing new things often leads to a sense of excitement as it is a novel experience that can be thrilling and adventurous. Curiosity may also be felt, but it is more of a desire to learn and understand rather than an emotion. Boredom and fear are less likely to be associated with new experiences, while wonder can be a close second to excitement, but it often implies a sense of awe or amazement, rather than just the thrill of something new.
The sentence implies that a strong laxative can help regulate bowel movements. "Regular" is often used to describe healthy bowel movements that occur on a consistent basis. The other options are unrelated or contradictory to the context of the sentence.
A connection that allows someone to go to another place would most likely refer to a network connection, such as the internet, that allows someone to access resources located elsewhere. The other options, such as wires or a wall, do not have any clear connection to the idea of going to another place. Freeways may allow physical travel to another place, but they are not typically referred to as "connections."
The sentence suggests that God has a specific expectation or desire for people in regards to money, and the answer choice "work in life" aligns with the biblical idea of earning one's own living through labor (2 Thessalonians 3:10). The other choices do not relate to the context of God's view on money.
Lips are typically located on the lower and upper areas of the mouth. The other options - jars and all faces, Kentucky Fried Chicken, hand, and human - do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking for a location where a pen can be carried while going through the day, which suggests a portable location. Options such as "office supply store," "friend's house," "desk drawer," and "city hall" do not seem appropriate for carrying a pen throughout the day. Conversely, a "pocket" is a common place to carry small objects such as pens, making it the most logical choice.
The question asks for a food item that goes well with potatoes, and the choices provided include two locations (Maryland and kitchen cupboard) and two types of meat (chicken and tuna). Based on the context of the question, it is likely that the correct answer is a type of meat. Chicken is a common white meat that pairs well with potatoes in many dishes, such as roasted chicken and mashed potatoes or chicken and potato casserole. Tuna, on the other hand, is not typically paired with potatoes in Western cuisine, and the two location options (Maryland and kitchen cupboard) do not provide any clear connection to the question.
The phrase "instituting civil action" suggests a legal process, and going to court is a common outcome of legal action. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the legal or judicial system.
The sentence suggests that hitting someone while driving could have serious consequences for that person. The option "deaths" reflects the severity of the situation and the potential danger that the person faces. This option is supported by statistics that show that car accidents can result in fatalities. The other options do not reflect the gravity of the situation and are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The word "chatting" suggests a casual conversation, which is often done for enjoyment or social reasons. The other options don't make sense in this context, as they don't explain why someone would chat during class specifically. "Necessity" might make sense if the conversation was related to the class material, but "answers" and "inspiration" are too specific and unlikely to be the sole reason for chatting. "Love" is also unlikely unless the context of the sentence suggests a romantic relationship.
Manufacturing operations involve the production of goods on a large scale, which is typically done in a dedicated facility called a factory. Schools, grocery stores, bands, and aircraft all have different functions and purposes that do not involve the mass production of goods.
The sentence indicates that the man didn't like stepping on cold tiles, which suggests that he put carpeting in a place where he frequently walks barefoot. The most logical option is the bedroom, where people often walk in and out of bed barefoot. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the liquid meal mentioned can be made more flavorful by adding pepper and salt. The options "supermarket," "cellars," and "grocery store" are locations and not applicable to the question's context. While water can be used to create a liquid meal, it is unlikely that it would benefit from pepper and salt, making it an unlikely answer. However, soup is a type of liquid meal that is commonly seasoned with pepper and salt to enhance its taste.
Shouting at someone across a room may be considered rude and inappropriate, while boarding a ship, crossing a street, or feeling happy have no connection to getting someone's attention. On the other hand, smiling is a friendly and non-threatening approach that can grab someone's attention and convey a positive attitude.
The question suggests that the dog in question is a stray, meaning it does not have an owner and has likely wandered away from its home. Animal shelters are known for taking in stray animals and providing them with care until they can either be reunited with their owner or adopted by a new family. The other options do not seem like logical places to find a stray dog, as a living room and a dog show would imply that the dog already has an owner, while georgia and pet shops do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The opera is a form of entertainment that is usually associated with relaxation and enjoyment. It often involves beautiful music and elaborate costumes and sets, which are designed to transport the audience to another time and place. While some people may find the opera boring or experience headaches from the loud music, the majority of people who attend the opera do so to experience a sense of relaxation and enjoyment.
The context suggests that people who love a vacation destination want to prolong their stay there. This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices, such as overspending and debt, do not logically follow from the initial statement. Additionally, the natural desire to want to remain in an enjoyable location for as long as possible supports the idea that people who love a vacation spot are more likely to want to stay there.
The sentence mentions that the card players were sitting emotionless, which is a common feature of poker games where players often try to hide their emotions in order to bluff their opponents. The sentence also suggests that the scene is taking place in an aquarium, which is not relevant to any of the other options. "Card shark" is a term used to refer to a skilled card player, but it does not give any information about the type of game being played in this sentence. "Sea world" and "shallow waters" do not have any clear relevance to the context. "Court room" may have been a possibility, but the mention of the shark swimming in the background suggests otherwise.
A drugstore is a place where medication and healthcare products are sold without a prescription. Contraceptive devices, such as condoms or spermicides, are included in these products and can be purchased without a prescription at a drugstore. While a pharmacy may also sell these products, they may require a prescription in some cases. A person or bedroom would not be appropriate places to purchase contraceptive devices, and McDonald's is not a location that sells healthcare products.
The question suggests that the desk is used by a young person, which would most likely be in a personal space such as a bedroom. While offices, schoolrooms, and libraries may have desks, they are typically used by a variety of people and not specifically young individuals. A gym would not typically have a desk at all.
The question is asking about a place where one can buy clothes, specifically socks and jeans. The option "washing machine" is incorrect as that is a household appliance used for cleaning clothes. "Laundromat" is where one goes to wash clothes but not to buy them. "Closet" is a storage space in one's home and not a place to purchase clothing. "Shopping mall" is an option that could work, but "clothing store" is a more specific and accurate answer as it is a type of store that specializes in selling clothes, including socks and jeans.
The sentence suggests that the farmer is compassionate and cares for the heifer's well-being, indicating that the heifer is not being sent to a place where it will be killed for its meat or dairy. A cattle ranch and dairy farm are places where cows and heifers are typically raised for their meat or milk, so they are unlikely options. A grocery store is a place where food is sold, not where animals live. A slaughterhouse is where animals are killed for their meat, so it is also an unlikely option. The countryside is a more plausible option, as it suggests an open space where the heifer can roam free during its last days.

The sentence suggests that the place people might go to celebrate would have rides, which is commonly associated with amusement parks such as Disneyland. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shark was traveling long distances between continents, which would likely mean it was found in the open ocean. Biologists often track the movements of marine animals in the open ocean using satellite tracking or acoustic tags, so it is reasonable to assume that they found the shark in the open ocean. The other options do not make as much sense based on the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Lilly's deli is located in an area where there may be a significant Jewish population, as kosher food is specific to Jewish dietary laws. Therefore, it is likely that Lilly would live in or near a Jewish community. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the parking lot mentioned is associated with a place where people would likely carry shopping bags, which indicates that it is a shopping mall. The other options are not typically associated with carrying shopping bags, and therefore, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the task of stopping being married was costly due to the high cost of lawyers and something else that was astronomical. The only choice that relates directly to the context is legal fees, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as free time, pleasure, or being lonely, do not have any clear connection to the sentence's context.
The phrase "chop up a grape" implies slicing or cutting up small pieces of fruit, which is commonly done when making a fruit cocktail. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - a fresh fruit typically does not need to be chopped up, a wine press is not used to chop fruit, a fruit basket is for presenting whole fruits, and a picnic basket could contain a variety of items, not necessarily chopped fruit.
The question is asking for a place that could have tens of thousands of fiddles, which is an unrealistic number for any of the other options. A music store, on the other hand, is a place where one could expect to find a large number of fiddles for sale, including rare and collectible models. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "ungulate" refers to a large mammal that has hooves, such as deer, elk or moose. The sentence suggests that James used a cannon to shoot at an animal while he was looking for lunch. The word "overkill" implies that his choice of weapon was excessive or unnecessary. Given this information, the most logical answer would be "ungulate" since it is a type of animal that is commonly hunted for food. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - for example, it is illegal to kill people or bombers with a cannon, and body armor does not typically require a cannon to penetrate.
The sentence suggests that James needs to work on his report before it is due tomorrow. The most likely place for him to do that work is in a space where he has access to resources like books, research materials, and a quiet place to work. The library is the most appropriate choice out of the given options, as it fits these criteria. The university and college class options are too broad, and the classroom option is not specific enough to indicate where James might work on his report.
The sentence suggests that the question is asking for a general location where one is likely to find many theaters. Populated areas are likely to have a higher concentration of theaters due to the availability of an audience and potential customers. Schools, military bases, and churches may have a theater but are not likely to have multiple theaters. An opera house may have a theater, but it is a specific type of theater and not the general location being asked for in the question.
The sentence suggests that the person's running escape was cut short because they tripped, indicating that the person may have neglected to tie their shoelace properly. Tying one's shoelace is a common safety measure when engaging in physical activity to prevent falls and accidents. The other options do not offer a logical explanation for why the person's escape was cut short.
Schools are often located in residential neighborhoods, as they need to be easily accessible to families with children. Community and building are too general, and Prague and every city are not relevant to the context of the question.
The question is asking which action would be appropriate to show appreciation for a compliment. The phrase "thank someone" suggests that gratitude is a key component of the answer. Options like "smile", "shake hands", and "say you're welcome" are polite responses, but do not directly address the issue of expressing gratitude. "Appreciate compliment" is a similar phrase to "thank someone", but it is not an action that can be taken, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the glass was broken from the inside of the car. Therefore, the broken glass would be found inside the car, not outside. This eliminates all of the options except for "inside the car." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about the consequences of not having enough food, and the phrase "not having enough food" commonly refers to a lack of sustenance that leads to malnutrition and eventual death if left unchecked. Eating fish or talking to each other are not necessarily relevant to the question and do not address the serious consequences of malnutrition. "They steal" may be a possible consequence of people not having enough food, but it is not as severe or certain as dying of starvation. Writing stories does not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "utensils" refers to tools used for eating, such as forks, knives, and spoons. The context of the sentence suggests that these tools are used during an evening activity, and the most common evening activity involving eating utensils is dinner. The other options (backpack, closet, drawer, cupboard) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Operations with numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, which is commonly taught through textbooks. Textbooks are written to provide a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts, including operations with numbers, and are designed to be used both in the classroom and for independent study. The other options, such as phonebooks, statistics or music schools, have no relevance to the subject of operations with numbers.
The sentence implies that the creatures being referred to are appreciated and cherished by a large number of people, which suggests that they have some positive or beneficial quality. The term "pollination" indicates that the creatures are likely insects or animals that help to transfer pollen from one flower to another, and butterflies are well-known for their role in pollination as well as their beauty and popularity among nature-lovers. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Avoiding eye contact is a common sign that someone may be lying. This is because the person may feel uncomfortable or nervous about lying and making direct eye contact can reveal their deception. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the friends enjoyed competing against each other, which implies that they viewed the competition as a positive activity. The word "work" suggests that there was a benefit or positive outcome associated with the competition. Given the positive connotation of the sentence, the best choice is "friendship" because it implies that the competition strengthened the bond between the friends. The other options have negative connotations that are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James enjoyed looking at the stars and that they illuminated something in the wilderness. The options "outer space," "universe," and "orbit" are all related to space, but they do not relate to the context of the sentence. "The ground" is also unlikely as stars do not typically illuminate the ground. "Night sky" is the most likely answer as it refers to the area of the sky that is visible at night and would be where James could observe the stars lighting up the darkness.
The sentence suggests that watching TV or playing with a cell phone is a routine activity, but it does not help in achieving a certain goal. The other options like "having TV", "falling asleep", "sitting", or "dancing" are not related to the idea of achieving a goal or acquiring new knowledge. Hence, the correct answer could be "learn" as watching TV or playing with a cell phone does not contribute to one's learning or knowledge acquisition.
The sentence suggests that only a selected few are able to turn their creativity into a profession. Creating art is a well-known career path for artists, painters, illustrators, and other kinds of creators who utilize their creativity to produce unique and aesthetically pleasing pieces of work. The other options may involve creativity, but they don't necessarily connote a profession. For example, sewing can just be a hobby for someone, whereas writing can be a profession for journalists, reporters or authors, but not necessarily a creative one.
The question asks for a type of water transportation that is human-powered, which means that it is powered solely by the physical effort of a person. The options "turn away," "let down," "have to sleep," and "run" do not have any clear connection to human-powered transportation. However, a row boat is commonly understood to be a type of watercraft that is propelled by oars, which are operated by a person's physical effort.
The question implies that the activity being described involves an auditory component that is not accessible to individuals who are deaf. Smiling, sweating, acting, and dancing can all be enjoyed by deaf individuals as they do not rely on the ability to hear. Singing, on the other hand, involves creating and hearing sound, which deaf individuals would not be able to enjoy.
The sentence suggests that the person in the line is feeling frustrated because the line is not moving. This feeling of frustration is commonly associated with anger, as the person may feel that their time is being wasted or that they are not being treated fairly. The other options, such as order or queueing up, do not accurately reflect the emotional state of the person in the situation described. Wait turn and fatigue may also be common emotions experienced when standing in line but are not the most appropriate choices based on the sentence structure.
The context of the sentence describes Bob putting on clothing and accessories commonly worn when swimming, such as waterproof trunks and goggles. This suggests that he is visiting a facility where swimming is taking place, and the most likely choice from the given options is a swimming pool. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the actions customers take inside a store. The most common action that customers take is to purchase goods or services, which requires them to spend money. The other options may be actions that customers can take in certain situations, but they do not apply to the general experience of being inside a store.
The sentence suggests that the cubicles in the office serve a specific purpose related to the use of computers by employees. The most logical answer from the given choices would be "do work," as this implies that the computers in the cubicles are used for productivity and completing job-related tasks. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or do not fit with the function of an office setting.
Dirt is a natural substance commonly found in gardens, so it would make sense to store dirt there. It is not practical or sanitary to store dirt in fingernails, a corner, or a computer. Storing dirt in a closet could also be problematic as it could potentially damage clothing or other items stored there.
The sentence suggests that the person is selling collector items, including a rare plate, which indicates that these items may have been purchased at a special place or event. A flea market is a common place for collectors to find unique and rare items, making it a likely choice for where the person may have acquired their collector items. None of the other options provide a logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the method of transportation is fast, which rules out options that are slower like ships, boats, trucks, and trains. It also suggests that the method of transportation is expensive, which rules out options like trucks and trains that are generally more affordable. The only option that meets both criteria is an airplane, which is known for its speed and high cost of operation.
A solar system is a star and all of the planets, moons, asteroids, and other bodies that orbit around it. The statement in the question describes a star with eight planets orbiting it, which matches the definition of a solar system. The other options, such as hollywood, night sky, constellation, and aliens, do not relate to the concept of a star with planets orbiting it.
The sentence is asking if someone would be willing to milk a cow, which suggests that the person needs help with this task. The phrase "step forward" implies that the speaker is looking for a willing volunteer to offer assistance. The other options do not relate to the request for help with milking a cow.
Based on the sentence, the food must be freeze-dried before it is taken on a specific vehicle. The options "fairgrounds" and "friend's house" do not fit the context because they are not vehicles. The options "oven" and "microwave" are household appliances and do not relate to transportation. Therefore, the correct answer is "space shuttle," which is a vehicle used for space travel and requires freeze-dried food due to weight restrictions and preservation needs.
The question is asking for a useful activity when experiencing loneliness. Socializing with others is a well-established way to cope with loneliness and can provide a sense of connection and belonging. Meeting people or making friends can also be helpful, but these options may take more time and effort. Making people laugh or drinking liquor may provide temporary relief, but they are not sustainable solutions for coping with loneliness.
The sentence suggests that the person is finishing their workday and is preparing to turn off their computer. The phrase "start menu" typically refers to the button on the desktop screen that allows the user to access various options, including shutting down or restarting the computer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a person wanting to buy a radio, which is a consumer electronic product that is commonly sold in stores or shops that specialize in selling electronic devices. "Station" and "every car and house" are unlikely places to buy a radio as they suggest that the person may already have a radio or have access to one, rather than needing to purchase a new one. "Bedroom" is not a logical choice as it is typically a private space where one would not expect to find a store selling radios. "Space shuttle" is not a logical choice as it is a spacecraft designed for space exploration, not a place to buy consumer electronics.
The sentence suggests that the person heard a joke and responded in some way. The word "chatting" implies a casual, social situation. The answer can be found by process of elimination: "lie" and "smoke" do not make sense in this context. "Laughing" and "chuckle" are similar in meaning to "giggle," but "giggle" specifically suggests a light, playful laugh, which is often how people respond to jokes in a social setting.
The word "old" implies that the clothing has been stored away for a long time, which suggests that it might be found in a trunk or a suitcase. These items are often used for storage and may not be opened frequently, allowing clothing to accumulate inside. The options of a drawer, book shelf or washing machine do not provide a likely location for old clothing.
The word "obtuse" is often used to describe an angle that is greater than 90 degrees, and is therefore not acute (less than 90 degrees). Therefore, "acute angled" is the option that is logically contradictory to "obtuse." The other options may or may not be related to "obtuse," but they do not form a clear logical opposite.
The context of the sentence suggests that the word being sought is a result of learning. While all the answer choices are related to the concept of learning, the most appropriate option is "intelligence," which refers to a person's ability to reason, understand complex ideas, and solve problems. The other choices are either redundant (e.g., "education" and "gaining knowledge") or insufficient (e.g., "get to know") in capturing the meaning conveyed by the sentence.
The phrase "peak of his fandom" implies that the artist was at the height of his popularity, which is typically when artists take advantage of their success by monetizing their work. The phrase "cashing in" reinforces this idea by suggesting the artist wanted to make money. The term "selling out" specifically refers to compromising one's artistic integrity in exchange for financial gain, which is a common criticism artists face when they become too commercial. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "get away from them" suggests that Sam wants to physically distance himself from the people he met while traveling. Of the available options, "go out" is the only one that could potentially facilitate this action. "Come home" would bring Sam even closer to the people he wants to avoid, "airplane" may be a mode of transportation but it doesn't necessarily help Sam escape from the people he doesn't like, "learn from each other" suggests a desire to engage with the people he didn't like, and "make art" is completely unrelated to the situation presented in the question.
The sentence suggests that the children were excited to see Superman fly overhead, which would likely elicit a positive response or exclamation. "Awesome" is a commonly used exclamation to express excitement or admiration, especially in situations where something impressive or thrilling has occurred. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no indication of pain or disinterest.
The sentence suggests that there is a way to identify illegitimate designer handbags, and one of those ways is through the absence of a certificate. The word "authentic" refers to something that is real or genuine, so it makes sense that illegitimate designer handbags would not have an authentic certificate. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the state being referred to is shaped like a glove and has a lot of farmland. Michigan is a state that is shaped like a mitten, resembling a glove, and it is known for having a significant amount of farmland. The other choices do not match the description given in the question.
The question is asking for a type of furniture that is specifically used for storing paper files, which eliminates options like computers and desks. The most common type of furniture used for this purpose is a filing cabinet, which typically has multiple drawers specifically designed to hold folders and files. While a desk may have a drawer that could be used for this purpose, it is not typically used for storing large quantities of paper files.
Excavation is a common practice in archeological sites and construction sites, as well as in building and city areas. However, it is considered disrespectful and illegal to conduct excavation in a cemetery. This knowledge is based on cultural and legal norms that dictate how human remains should be treated and protected. Therefore, among the given options, the only place that excavation should never take place is a cemetery.
The question mentions a specific type of view - a view of corn fields. Nebraska is a state known for its large corn production, making it a likely location for a steakhouse with such a view. The other options do not have a strong association with corn or steakhouse dining.
The sentence suggests that there is a consequence for harming property after starting a fire. Going to jail is a common punishment for committing arson, which involves setting fire to property on purpose. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that keeping marijuana in bags can assist with maintaining a specific quality or condition. Keeping marijuana in bags can help preserve its freshness and prevent it from becoming stale or dry. Knowing this, it's clear that the correct answer is "neat", because all of the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A place that could have thousands of statues would need to be large enough to accommodate them, and would likely be a public space where people can enjoy the sculptures. Central Park in New York City has over 900 statues, monuments, and sculptures, making it a prime contender for the correct answer. The other options do not have as much space or significance as Central Park.
The sentence suggests that horse racing is the sport being referred to, as it mentions "gamblers" and "horse." The use of the phrase "not just the regular gamblers" suggests that there may be some special event or circumstance that is causing more people than usual to have horses, and therefore more people than usual are attending the sport. Of the choices given, only "race track" directly relates to horse racing, while the other options either refer to specific races (such as the Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown) or are general regions (such as the American Southwest) that do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in the woods is wounded and alone, and the best option among the choices is to "doctor himself," which means to treat his own injuries. This may involve basic first aid techniques or using items in the environment to create makeshift medical supplies. The other options do not provide any help or assistance with the situation described in the sentence.
When a company goes public, it is offering shares of its ownership to the public for purchase. This process is known as an initial public offering (IPO) and allows the company to raise funds by selling shares to investors. Going public is often seen as a way to access more funding, as the company can use the funds raised through the IPO to finance its operations and future growth. The other options do not have a clear relationship to the context of a company going public.
The sentence suggests that the human is gazing down at something from space, indicating that they are in orbit around the earth. The description of the human's expression as "longingly" suggests they are missing something or yearning for it. The phrase "surface of earth" most accurately reflects what the human may be missing while they are in the artificial environment of the space station. The other answer options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that standing in a puddle is undesirable and the question is asking how to end up not standing in one. "Walking out of" makes the most sense as it means physically leaving the area of the puddle. "Move away from" and "laying in" may also prevent standing in a puddle, but they do not directly address the question. "Sweating" and "movement" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions "an Indian restaurant" and "the Space Needle," suggesting that John is likely at the Space Needle in Seattle and looking to order Indian food. Out of the given options, only "curry" is a type of Indian food that one might order at a restaurant. The other options either don't make sense in the context or are not related to food.
The question specifies that the mountain is located in an eastern state, which rules out options like Switzerland, Asia, and Austria. Picture is not a state and does not fit the parameters of the question. Pennsylvania is known to have several mountain ranges, including the Appalachian Mountains, making it a likely choice for the correct answer.
The context of the sentence is that Sam left his muddy shoes in the entryway, which suggests that he went into a building, not an open space like a garden or a department store. The options of school and office building are also plausible, but the use of the word "entryway" implies a residential setting rather than a professional or educational one.
The sentence suggests that the person just woke up, which means their eyes are likely closed. Opening their eyes would be the most natural thing for them to do as they become fully awake and alert. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to protect their arm from being injured by taking the impact on another part of their body. In this case, the best option to take the impact would be the shoulder. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as it would not be practical or useful to try to take the impact on a leg, garment, torso, body, or road.
Deodorant is a personal hygiene product that is commonly sold in grocery stores alongside other health and beauty items like shampoo, toothpaste, and soap. It is designed to be applied to the armpits in order to prevent body odor, which indicates that option 3, "armpits," is not correct as it is not a location where deodorant can be purchased. The other two options, "medicine cabinet" and "medicine chest," refer to storage units for medications and are not retail locations where products can be purchased. Option 5, "kitchen," is also not correct as it is not generally a location where personal hygiene products are sold.
Taking a vacation is often associated with getting away from the stresses of everyday life and taking time to unwind and relax. Admiration and good things in life are not directly related to taking a vacation, while owning a house and needing money may be reasons why someone cannot take a vacation rather than reasons why they would choose to do so.
The phrase "take the lead with small papers" suggests a card game where players use small cards to gain an advantage or take the lead. The other options (very heavy, video game, news article, lead pencil) do not have any clear connection to playing with small papers.
Drugstores commonly sell a variety of health and hygiene products, including hairbrushes and bandages. Hospital, car, and bedroom do not typically have stores that sell these items, while "house" is too broad for a specific answer.
The context of the question suggests that it is related to a reception, which is often associated with events such as weddings. At a wedding reception, the center table is typically reserved for the wedding party, which consists of the bride and groom, their parents, and the bridesmaids and groomsmen. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the clothing was priced higher than usual, which implies that it was likely purchased at a store that specializes in high-end or luxury items. Department stores are often associated with selling expensive clothing brands and designer items, making it the most fitting choice among the given options. The other options, like a cinema hall or a closet, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about what is used to print, which implies a writing or drawing instrument. A pencil is not used for printing as it leaves a mark by removing graphite from the pencil lead, while a newspaper and printer are output devices rather than input devices. A squid, while capable of ejecting ink, is not a tool for printing text or images in a human context. A fountain pen, on the other hand, is filled with ink and used to produce clean, consistent lines on paper, making it a suitable answer.
Candles are commonly used in dining settings to create a warm and intimate atmosphere. They are often placed on tables, particularly in dimly lit rooms or at night, to provide additional light and add to the ambiance. The other options do not make as much sense as candles are typically not associated with kitchen or wall decor, and birthday cakes already have candles on them.
FC is a well-known fast food restaurant chain that primarily serves chicken. The other options, such as plate, bowl, freezer, and oven, do not describe what KFC is or what it does.
The sentence suggests that John did not enjoy having sex or engaging in sexual activities. Specifically, he had a "hangup" about being naked, which implies that he may have felt uncomfortable or self-conscious when unclothed. The other options are all related to sexual activity, but do not specifically address the issue of nudity or John's discomfort with being naked.
The other options all suggest places where a marmoset could go or travel to. Marmosets are non-flying animals and do not typically burrow underground, but they are known to live in the wilderness and could potentially be found in Colorado. However, there is no reason why a marmoset would be associated with a dictionary, making it the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the child is on his way to play, but it doesn't mention anything about the child already being happy or entertained. It's possible that the child may laugh or feel happy while playing, but that's not what the question is asking. The sentence mentions that the child is "going" to play, which implies movement, so it's more likely that the child will walk slowly towards his destination rather than sit still or run.
The question is asking for a factor that can prevent someone from getting sleep at night. "Relax" and "dreams" are not factors that prevent sleep, but rather ways to promote it. "Have nightmares" is a factor that can disrupt sleep, but not necessarily prevent it from occurring. "Snore" is a behavior that can disrupt someone else's sleep, but not necessarily their own. "Restlessness" is a common factor that can prevent someone from getting enough sleep and is often linked to anxiety or discomfort.
The phrase "reaching advantage position" suggests that the person has gained an advantage over their competitors. The phrase "upper hand" is commonly used to describe having an advantage or being in control of a situation, whereas the other options do not necessarily connote an advantage in a competition. "Determination" and "skill" may contribute to a person's success, but they do not necessarily indicate that the person has already achieved an advantage over others. "Superior" and "higher position" are also possible answers, but "upper hand" is a more natural fit for the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the chair was meant to be used in a workspace where the speaker could receive visitors while working. The most likely location for this would be an office. The other options, such as a building, library, or table, are too general and do not specifically indicate a workspace. The option of a bathtub is also clearly not the correct answer, as it is not a logical location for a chair meant for receiving visitors.
Wine is commonly stored in a cool, dark place to ensure its quality and flavor are preserved. The attic may be not ideal since it often gets hot and sunlight can damage the wine. Art show and church are not related to wine storage in any way. A bar may store wine, but it may not be the best option for long-term storage as they may not have a controlled environment.
The sentence suggests that John's motivation for spending a lot of money on products for his swollen testicles was not enjoyment, but rather pain. The word "agony" indicates that John was probably experiencing considerable discomfort from his swollen testicles, which led him to seek relief through various products. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people talk to him as if he is a child, despite his physical disability not affecting his brain. This implies that his mental capacity is unaffected by his disability. The options "strength", "potential", "qualification", and "competence" are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not suggest any connection to his mental capacity.
The context suggests that the question is related to a speech taking place in the capital, and the phrase "biggest speech" may refer to a speech that is significant or important. The State of the Union address is a major speech given by the President of the United States in the capital, in which they discuss the state of the country and outline their legislative agenda for the coming year. The Gettysburg Address is a famous speech delivered by President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, but it is not given annually and does not take place in the capital. The other options (each state, each country, Europe) are not related to the context of the question.
The context suggests that the presence of children has led to the accumulation of many plastic things in a specific place. The most likely place for children's things in the home would be the "own home" option. "Cupboard" and "cabinet" are too specific and do not necessarily imply the presence of children. "Everything" is a vague option that does not fit the context. "Garbage dump" is clearly not a realistic option in this context.
The word "competing" implies a contest or competition, where individuals or teams are striving to win against others. To have an "edge" in this context means having an advantage or superiority over the competition, which is what people typically look for when competing against others. The other options may be relevant in other contexts, but they do not fully capture the essence of competition as described in the question.
The sentence mentions drought regulations, which suggests that the location of the swimming pool is in a place affected by a drought. California is a state known for its water shortages and droughts, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not provide any information about their location, and the mention of first floor suggests that the sentence may not be referring to an outdoor swimming pool.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is experiencing abandonment after a divorce or the end of a marriage. This would likely lead to feelings of isolation, as they may no longer have the same social support network that they had before the divorce. Grief might also be a possible response, as the end of a significant relationship can be emotional, but this would not necessarily apply to everyone in this situation. Pleasure and happiness are unlikely responses given the context of being abandoned, and "solo" is not a feeling in itself, but rather a description of being alone.
The context of the sentence mentions a bride and groom, which implies some kind of wedding ceremony. The choices "efficiency," "getting work done," and "finishing up" do not relate to this context, while "results" is too vague to be a likely answer. Therefore, "marriage" is the correct option.
The question asks specifically about something that is covered by the ocean, which eliminates options like waterfalls and rivers that are not typically found in the ocean. The clue "three quarters" suggests a large proportion, which eliminates options like beach that only cover a small strip of land. The most logical answer is the surface of earth, since the earth is mostly covered by water and the ocean is the largest body of water on earth.
The phrase "approached by a lot of people" suggests that the person in question is well-known and admired by many individuals, which are characteristics commonly associated with popularity. Compliments and caring about others may also lead to being approached, but not necessarily by a lot of people. Knowing all and understanding oneself are not related to the context of being approached by others.
The sentence indicates that the woman is good at entertaining, and people have acknowledged this quality by telling her something. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a word that has a positive connotation and implies a skill or ability. "Fun" and "learn about" are not directly related to the woman's ability to entertain, while "intelligence" and "recognize" are not appropriate choices since they do not match the context of the sentence. "Talent" is the best answer as it suggests a natural ability or aptitude for a particular activity, which fits with the woman's knack for entertaining.
The question is asking where someone would likely store a double edge razor, which is a type of razor commonly used for shaving. The options pocket, shower, chemist, and drug store are unlikely places to store a razor, as they are not designed for razor storage. A shaving kit, on the other hand, is a specifically designed container for razor storage and other shaving supplies, making it the most likely option for storing a double edge razor.
The sentence suggests that people are going to a specific location to watch a new movie, which is commonly done at a theater. The other options do not have any clear connection to watching a movie, such as a town or train station. The conference and bathroom are not places where people typically go to watch movies.
The question implies that the person in question is content, which is commonly associated with feeling happy or fulfilled. The other options do not necessarily have any correlation to being satisfied, such as boarding a ship or crossing a street, and may even be negative or unrelated activities, such as shouting at someone or grocery shopping.
The sentence suggests that Dave wanted his beer to be easily accessible but not on the floor, which makes the most sense if it is placed on a shelf. The other options do not provide a clear indication of a location where Dave could store his beer off the floor but still easily accessible.
The sentence suggests that when eating breakfast with a large family, there will be a lot of dishes to wash afterwards. This is a common occurrence when many people eat together, especially if they are preparing and using a variety of dishes and utensils. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where people gather to sit and face a stage or screen, as if watching a performance. The option "theater" is the most likely choice, as it is a venue specifically designed for this purpose. The other options may have chairs in them, but do not necessarily involve the specific layout or purpose of a theater.
The question asks for a place to store a chess pawn, suggesting that it needs to be some type of container or case. Out of the choices given, small case is the only one that fits this criteria. A chess set typically contains multiple pieces and doesn't provide individual storage for each piece, while strategy and chess game are not physical places to store a pawn. A toy store is also not a viable option as it is a location to purchase items rather than store them.
The sentence implies that the person is known for buying presents for others frequently. Buying gifts for others is often seen as an act of generosity, indicating that the correct answer is "generous." The other options are not applicable to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a shape similar to that of a glove and is also known for its lack of anemone. This eliminates choices like Michigan (not glove-shaped), tide pool (not a state), and Atlantic Ocean (not glove-shaped and too large for the context of the sentence). Nurseries are also not typically associated with anemone. This leaves the option Lake as the correct answer as it is both shaped like a glove and can be a habitat for anemone.
The sentence indicates that the keys are black and white, which is a common color scheme for piano keys. Therefore, the keys were most likely attached to a piano. The other options do not have any clear relationship to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that fish are doing something that does not involve grades or sitting at desks. The clue to the correct answer is in the phrase "school together" which means that the fish are swimming in a group with coordinated movement patterns. Fish are known to school together for protection and to increase their chances of finding food, which makes this option the most logical choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "in charge of project" implies that the person is responsible for managing a project. In order to effectively manage a project, it is important to have knowledge about the subject matter at hand, as well as relevant skills and experience. Greed and worry are not traits that are typically associated with effective project management. "Take charge" and "boss" suggest a more authoritarian style of leadership, which may not be necessary or effective in all project management situations.
"Say goodbye" is a common phrase used to signal the end of a conversation, while "open letter" is a written communication, "thank god" and "bless you" are expressions of gratitude or blessings, and "listen to radio" has no connection to the context of ending a conversation.
The question is asking about a physical activity of running after a ball, which requires the use of one's legs. The other options, such as getting tired or skipping, do not relate to the fundamental requirement of having functioning legs. Additionally, being not fat or looking first do not directly contribute to the ability to physically run after a ball.
The word "graveyard" suggests a place where airplanes are stored when they are no longer in use, often because they are old or damaged beyond repair. This is commonly known as an airplane graveyard or boneyard. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question - "war" and "crash" could refer to situations where airplanes are used or damaged, while "aircraft carrier" and "sky" do not provide any information about where unused airplanes might be found.
The sentence suggests that the person is processing wool, which is commonly done using a spinning wheel. The phrase "kept her leg bouncing" also suggests a repetitive movement, which is similar to the motion of operating a spinning wheel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a location where a computer can be placed other than a desk, which implies that the location must be a flat surface that can support a computer. An apartment, school, office, or house could all technically have a desk, so they are unlikely to be the correct answer. A table, on the other hand, is a piece of furniture that can be found in various locations and can serve as an alternative to a desk.
The sentence mentions buying treats for kids, which is often associated with candy. Candy stores typically sell candy, sweets, and treats over a counter, making it the most likely option for the correct answer. The other options (butcher shop, kitchen, auto repair shop, post office) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that long term consumption of beer can lead to negative consequences, implying that it can be harmful to a person's health or well-being. Water and liquid are too broad and do not convey negative consequences. Foamy and intoxicating do not accurately reflect the negative consequences associated with long term beer consumption.
The question does not specify that a human makes any noise when going to sleep, which rules out options like snoring and talking. While a person may experience relaxation or loss of consciousness, those are not really "noises" they make. Dreaming also does not typically involve any audible sounds. Therefore, the correct answer is "None of the above."
The sentence conveys that the boy was too nervous to dance, which suggests that he may have felt uncomfortable or out of place in the context of the ball. The term "wallflower" is often used to describe someone who is shy or introverted and tends to stay on the sidelines at social gatherings, while the other options either contradict or do not provide any meaningful information within the context of the sentence.
The mention of a laundry room only used by staff implies that it is a part of a larger establishment rather than a single residence, such as a hotel or maybe even a hospital or office building. The other options do not have a clear need for a laundry room that is separate from the main area.
Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water, such as streams, rivers, and ponds. They create a habitat for themselves in and around the body of water, which is why it is most likely that they leave in this environment. The other options, such as a zoo or a specific region like British Columbia, do not have a clear connection to the natural environment of beavers. Wooded areas may be near bodies of water, but the question specifically asks where a beaver leaves, suggesting that there is a specific destination in mind.
A village is typically a small, rural community, so the opposite would be a large, urban area. The term "big city" is commonly used to describe densely populated urban centers with a lot of cultural, economic, and social activity. The other options may be related to rural areas or communities, but do not necessarily represent the opposite of a village.
The use of the word "view" suggests that the artist was capturing a scene or setting, which is typically associated with landscapes. The other options, such as east side, countryside, middle america, and Georgia, do not necessarily convey the same visual imagery or context. Additionally, the use of the word "plain" suggests a simplicity or lack of complexity, which is again commonly associated with landscapes.
Boredom implies a lack of interest or stimulation, and watching a film on television is a common way to alleviate this sense of disinterest. The other choices, such as playing cards or chess or reading newspapers, may provide entertainment or engagement for some people but they are not activities typically associated with television. Surfing the net is also a possibility, but the sentence specifically mentions television.
The sentence describes a location with a beach and shallow water that is enjoyed by locals. It also implies that this location is not the ocean. The options "pond", "swimming pool", and "children's pool" are not likely to have a beach or shallow water. "Bathe in" is a vague phrase and can apply to any body of water. Therefore, the most logical and likely answer is "lake".
The sentence implies that not being good at playing the violin would have a negative impact on a person. It suggests that the person may feel sadness as a result of their inability to play the instrument well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person wanted to preserve the cabbage for later use, which suggests that they would have stored it in a cooler environment. The most obvious option is the refrigerator since it is commonly used to keep food fresh for a longer period of time. The freezer is also a possibility, but it may affect the texture of the cabbage. The other options, such as the grocery store or supermarket, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that listening to each other can lead to better understanding, which in turn suggests that people can share knowledge and insights with each other. "Swap bodies" and "believe in god" are not logical outcomes of improved communication or understanding. "Pay bills" and "talk to each other" do not necessarily require a deeper level of understanding or knowledge-sharing between people.
Zebras are wild animals commonly found in Africa. They are not typically found in museums, hospitals, desks, or opera houses. However, zoos often have exhibits that showcase different species of animals, including zebras. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "zoo."
The sentence suggests a situation where a human would sit for a long time over a bowl of water, which is commonly associated with activities related to personal hygiene. Bathrooms are the most likely location for this scenario to occur, as they are typically equipped with facilities for washing and grooming. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John is feeling guilty for breaking something by accident that was located across the street from him. Since the only option related to something that could be located across the street is curtains, this suggests that John accidentally broke someone's curtains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "forgiving" implies that the person is not holding a grudge or anger towards someone else. Giving someone forgiveness typically results in them feeling a sense of relief and release from guilt or shame. Redemption and absolution both have religious connotations and are not necessarily a direct result of someone forgiving another person. Isolation and "feeling better" are not directly related to forgiveness either.
The sentence suggests that the salesman surprised the speaker by suddenly showing up, which is a characteristic commonly associated with appearing suddenly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of shopping at a car dealership.
The use of the word "feat" implies that the achievement was impressive or challenging, suggesting that reaching a tentative agreement was not an easy task. "Accomplish" is the best option as it directly relates to achieving a difficult task. "Make progress" and "stop arguing" are not specific enough to describe the accomplishment and "do business" and "concert" do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the police man was using flares to direct traffic. The phrase "wave on" means to allow a vehicle to proceed, which would make sense in this context. The other options do not have any connection to the idea of directing traffic with flares.
Garbage is typically disposed of in a landfill, which is a designated area where waste is buried underground. A dumpster or trashcan may be used to collect trash, but it is eventually taken to a landfill or similar facility for disposal. Television and Fox News have no clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that we are looking for a place where many people have been, and where the air has been breathed. A train station is a busy location where many people pass through, and where the air is constantly circulating due to the movement of trains and people. The other options either do not have a large number of people passing through, or do not involve the circulation of air in the same way as a train station.
Potatoes are a commonly used ingredient in fast food restaurants, particularly for items such as french fries and hash browns. While potato may be sold in vegetable and produce markets, these options do not specifically suggest a business that uses lots of potatoes. Ireland is known for its potato production, but this answer does not necessarily indicate a business that uses potatoes. Dessert spots are not typically associated with potato usage.
When someone is convicted of a crime, the judge will pass sentence. This means that the judge will decide the appropriate punishment for the crime that was committed. The other choices do not accurately describe the role of a judge after a conviction. A judge does not conduct a trial, as the trial has already been completed. They do not make an arrest, as that is the job of law enforcement. While a judge does bring in a verdict, that happens before the conviction. "Serve justice" is a vague answer that could apply to any number of actions a judge may take, but is not specific to what they do after a conviction.
The sentence suggests that security guards are driving around in golf carts to protect young adults in a specific location. This scenario is commonly associated with college or university campuses, where security guards often patrol the grounds in golf carts to ensure the safety of students. The other options, such as concert venues or airports, do not typically use golf carts as a means of security transportation, and the reference to young adults suggests an educational setting.
The sentence suggests that the man needed flooring for a specific location, which is likely to be his house. While it is possible to install flooring in a loft or any other locations, the most common place to install flooring is in a house. In addition, the other options, such as Home Depot, tiles, and carpet store, are places where the man could potentially purchase the flooring he needs, but they do not indicate the location where the flooring will be installed.
Pamphlets on diseases and ailments are most commonly found at health departments, doctor's offices, or hospitals. These locations are generally associated with providing medical advice and education, so it's logical that they would have resources available for those seeking information about health-related topics. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that humans might do something when their legs are tired, which can be inferred as an action related to resting. Among the choices, only "sit down" is a common action performed to rest the legs, while the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence. "Make mistakes," "have sex," "reproduce," and "excrete" are not actions commonly performed when someone's legs are tired.
The Atlantic Ocean is a body of water that exists on the planet Earth. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Mark is seeking the truth because he wants to stop living in a state of ignorance, which is the lack of knowledge or understanding about something. The word "ignorant" is given as one of the choices, but it is an adjective, not a noun that describes a state of being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about an animal that produces milk, which is a well-known fact about cows. Cows are a common source of milk for humans, as they are raised specifically for their milk production. The other options are not animals and have no relation to milk production.
The sentence suggests that there is a place where disease can spread, but it shouldn't. Hospitals are often the location where diseases can easily spread from patient to patient if proper sanitation and hygiene protocols are not followed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Beavers are known for building dams and lodges in order to create and manipulate bodies of water. This behavior is a key aspect of their survival as they rely on water for food and protection. The other options do not have any clear connection to the behavior of beavers.
The question suggests that cannon fire poses a threat to the person, which would require a material that is strong and resilient enough to withstand such an impact. Body armor is specifically designed to provide protection from projectiles like bullets and shrapnel, so it is the most appropriate answer option among the choices provided. The other options do not have any relation to protecting against cannon fire.
The sentence suggests that numbers are essential for the existence of society, which implies a connection to human populations. The options "population" and "populated area" directly relate to this idea, as they refer to areas where people live. "Create government" is not necessarily connected to the concept of numbers, and the options "group of people" and "make person sick" do not fit the context of the sentence.
Snakes are cold-blooded animals and are more commonly found in warmer climates such as the tropics. The other options, such as "nightmare," "Wyoming," and "bushes," do not have any clear connection to the context of the question and are less likely places for snakes to reside. "Field" could be a potential option, but it is not as specific as the tropical climate.
The sentence suggests that John was looking for a cheap and basic accommodation option. A motel is typically a budget-friendly lodging option that offers few amenities compared to a hotel. Farms, towns, and cities do not necessarily have an association with inexpensive lodgings, and a hotel typically offers more luxurious amenities than what John was looking for.
The other options all relate to places where a person may commonly take their car (city, repair shop, parking lot, neighbor's house), while taking a car down a river is an activity that is not commonly associated with vehicles. The use of "not happy" suggests that the person may be reluctant or unhappy about the idea of taking their car to any of the listed locations, further indicating that "down a river" is the correct answer option.
The sentence suggests that Bill bought a large item that requires a specific location to be stored - an upright piano. This implies that he needed to have enough space in his living quarters to accommodate the instrument. The other options, such as a band or music room, would be places specifically designed for instruments and would not have been mentioned in this way. Additionally, college and university do not provide any indication of where Bill lived, as he could have lived on or off campus.
The sentence suggests that the viola is one of many instruments being played together. This is a common feature of orchestras, which typically consist of a wide variety of instruments. Symphony orchestras and chamber orchestras are both types of orchestras, but the other options (band, create music, and string quartet) do not typically feature a large variety of instruments.
The sentence suggests that the traders are working in a specific place, which is commonly referred to as an exchange. This is where stocks are bought and sold, and traders work on the floor to complete these transactions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the real estate agent was trying to gain the trust of someone by being polite and delightful, which is a characteristic often associated with someone who is charming. Being charming means that a person is likeable and pleasant, which can be useful when trying to gain someone's trust. The other options have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of the sentence.
Bus stations often provide maps for their passengers, as they are a useful tool for travelers to navigate around a new city. Maps can help passengers locate their destination, find nearby landmarks, and plan their route. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - a lottery ticket, for example, would not be found at a bus station and does not provide any practical assistance.
Small grapes are typically used for making wine, which requires them to be pressed in a wine press to extract their juice. While grapes may also be used in fruit cocktails or as a snack in a picnic basket, these options do not specifically reference the use of small grapes or suggest that they would be used in a wine press. Juices are typically made from a variety of fruits, not just grapes. Kitchens may also be a place for preparing grapes, but again, the sentence specifically references the use of small grapes, which have a specific purpose.
The sentence discusses rumors of monsters killing people, which could cause fear and anxiety in the general population. Panic is a common reaction to such rumors, as people may feel threatened and unsure of how to protect themselves. The other options do not seem to fit well with the context of the sentence. Getting in trouble, going to prison, and committing murder are all unrelated to the situation at hand, while mass hysteria is a potential consequence of panic rather than a possible answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that remembering past successes is likely to have a positive effect, which may inspire or motivate the person. It is common for people to look back on their accomplishments for inspiration when they are facing new challenges. The other options do not fit the context, as problems, crying, trauma, and nightmares are more negative outcomes that are not typically associated with reflecting on past successes.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to organizing columns of numbers. While some of the options (such as roman architecture, whitehouse, bridge, and pantheon) may be associated with columns in a literal sense, none of them are relevant to the context of the sentence. A spreadsheet, however, is a tool commonly used for organizing and manipulating data in columns and rows, which makes it the most likely answer.
Popcorn and cotton candy are commonly sold at fairs and carnivals, which are often held at fairgrounds. Additionally, the mention of "on the grass" suggests that the person is outdoors, which rules out the movie theater. While soccer games may have concessions, they are typically played on a field or stadium, not on grass. The countryside and state park options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that waiting for something can lead to a negative emotion or feeling, which is commonly associated with getting bored. When people have to wait for something for a long time, they might start to feel restless, tired, or uninterested, which can result in boredom. The other options do not reflect a common experience associated with waiting, except for worry, which may sometimes occur but is not the best fit for the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a place with lots of windows. Out of the provided options, "office" is the most likely answer as many offices have windows to let in natural light and provide a view of the outdoors. "Wall," "front door," and "tent" are unlikely to have lots of windows, while "space shuttle" does have windows, but it is not considered a corner area.
The question indicates that the person being helped is not able to speak coherently, which means they may have a speech impediment or disability that makes it difficult to communicate verbally. Sign language is a visual language that involves communicating through hand gestures and body movements, which would allow the person being helped to express themselves even if they cannot speak clearly. The other options do not relate to helping someone who cannot speak coherently.
The sentence suggests that combat is a primary method in war, but it also implies that there is a broader goal beyond simply fighting. The phrase "conquer opponent" fits this context, as it suggests a strategic goal of defeating the enemy and gaining control over their territory. The other options either focus solely on fighting or are not relevant to the context of war.
The question is asking for a word that describes something that is not needed. The word "unnecessary" fits this meaning exactly. The other choices do not convey the same meaning. "Satisfied" refers to a feeling of contentment, not the object itself. "Luxury" suggests something that is not essential, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not needed. "Sufficient" means there is enough of something, but it does not convey a sense of necessity or lack of necessity. "Extra" also suggests something additional or surplus, but it does not necessarily imply that it is not needed.
The context suggests that the bag is used to hold laundry. A large netted drawstring bag is a common item used to transport dirty laundry to and from the laundry room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the investigator found some gun evidence, which he had to send to a particular location. One plausible location for gun evidence to be sent is the police station, where it can be analyzed by ballistics experts to determine if it was used in a particular crime. The other options do not make much sense – returning the gun to its owner or putting it in a drawer would not help with the investigation, and leaving it at the crime scene or in a holster would contaminate the evidence.
A passage from the bible is typically read but not written by the reader. The bible is a holy book that contains passages and teachings that are meant to be read by believers, but it is not customary to write in the bible itself. The other options do not involve written texts that are traditionally read but not written by the reader, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the armchair is used by only a few people, indicating that it is likely located in a private or personal space. An apartment or furniture store may have armchairs that are used by a variety of people, so they are unlikely options. A doctor's office or hospital may have armchairs that are used by many people on a daily basis, making them unlikely options as well. A study is a room that is often used by only a few people, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence indicates that the house is lacking humidity, which can be increased by introducing more moisture into the air. A humidifier is a device designed to add moisture to the air, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as the surface of the earth or a skating rink, have no relevance to the issue at hand. The option "burn it to the ground" is clearly not a reasonable solution.
This question implies that rooms that face outside have certain features in common. The most logical feature that all such rooms would have is doors and windows, which would allow for natural light and ventilation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence specifically says "on the side of their head," which eliminates the options of two feet and horns, as those are not typically located on the side of a human's head. The option of lay eggs is also eliminated as humans do not lay eggs. This leaves us with the option of two ears, which is a universal feature among all humans located on the side of their head. The option of one head is irrelevant as it is not a distinguishing feature among humans.
A harpsichord is a keyboard instrument often associated with classical music, particularly from the Baroque era. While it is possible to hear a harpsichord in other settings, such as a museum exhibit or a performance by a band that incorporates classical music, the most likely place to hear a harpsichord is in a concert hall, where classical music concerts are typically held. The options "make noise" and "rubber band" are not likely places to hear a harpsichord, and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the woman has been struggling to get a job despite being qualified, which can be a frustrating experience. The other options (employment, working hard, love) do not accurately reflect the emotional state that the woman is likely feeling. Stress could be a possible answer, but it is not as strongly implied as frustration.
The sentence suggests that being a model has some connection to looking beautiful, which is often associated with the profession. Models are generally hired to showcase clothing or products, and their appearance is a key factor in how effective their performance is. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The adjective "highly criticized" suggests that the security in question has received a lot of negative feedback or scrutiny. Among the options provided, airports are often subject to extensive security measures, including controversial procedures such as body scanners and pat-downs. The other options (university, concert, home, terminal) may have security systems in place, but they are typically not subject to the same level of criticism as airports.
The word "secular" refers to things that are non-religious or not related to spirituality. Therefore, the question is likely asking about how often non-religious parties or events are held. The word "frequent" makes the most sense in this context, as it suggests that secular parties are held often. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to a different aspect of parties (such as their length or size) or are irrelevant (such as "eternal").
The question implies that exercising has a specific purpose, and one of the most common reasons for people to exercise is to lose weight. Exercise helps burn calories, which can lead to weight loss when paired with a healthy diet. The other options, such as fatigue and relaxation, do not necessarily encourage exercise or provide a clear reason why exercise would be beneficial.
Fear can cause a person to experience a fight or flight response, which can include a physical reaction such as urination. This is known as the "fear-pee" response and is a common physiological response to fear. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The act of putting on makeup is generally associated with enhancing one's physical appearance. While some people may also derive pleasure from the act of applying makeup, the main goal is often to improve one's looks in order to receive compliments and feel more attractive. The options "interesting experiences" and "joy" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that more learning will lead to some kind of change in your knowledge. The options "headaches" and "bigger brain" are unlikely outcomes of learning, while "education" is too broad and general. "Knowing more" is too similar to the question itself and does not provide new information, leaving "growth" as the best option. Growth suggests that learning will lead to an expansion, improvement, or development of knowledge.
The word "tore" suggests that the wind was very strong and violent, which would fit with the option "blowing hard". The other options do not imply the same level of force and destruction that would be necessary to tear off shingles from a roof. "Dry hair" and "spreading" are too vague and do not give a clear indication of the wind's strength, while "change direction" and "wave wheat" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Dan has outfitted his house to run on the oldest heat source on Earth. Fire is the oldest form of heat used by humans and has been used for cooking, warmth, and light since prehistoric times. Solar energy and the sun are not heat sources that have been consistently used throughout human history. House is not a heat source at all, but rather a place where heat is contained. Coal or wood may be used as fuel for fire, but fire itself is the oldest heat source.
Horses are domesticated animals that are often kept for riding, racing, or agricultural purposes. They are typically housed in stables or farm yards where they have access to food, water, and shelter from the elements. While some horses may live at a race track during training and racing seasons, it is not a typical living arrangement for them. Michigan and Arizona are states and therefore not suitable living environments for horses.
The word "why" suggests that we are looking for the reason or motive behind the woman's singing. The option "insane" is a derogatory and incorrect assumption about her mental state. "Annoy people around" implies that she sings to irritate others, which is unlikely to be the reason behind her behavior. "Inhale" is not related to the context of the sentence. The option "had good voice" could be a possibility, but the sentence does not provide evidence to support it. The most likely answer is that she sings because she enjoys it, which is a common motive for performing music.
The sentence suggests that there is a particular body of water in Michigan that is known for being very large or impressive (referred to as "the greatest of Michigan's greats"), and that ice fishing can be done on this body of water even when it freezes over. Only Lake Superior fits this description, as it is the largest of the Great Lakes and is known for having a harsh winter climate. The other options do not match the context provided in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person referred to still sleeps on a sofa bed in his parents' house, despite being an adult. The options "garage," "horseradish," and "basement" are unlikely places for someone to sleep. "Guest room" is also unlikely, as it implies that the person is a guest in their own parents' house. Therefore, the most likely answer is "living room," as this is a common room in a house and may be a place where a sofa bed is located.
The sentence suggests that James keeps his clipboard close at hand for easy access. Typically, people keep items they use frequently on their desk, making it the most likely option among the choices. The other options are either nonsensical or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the mother was concerned about spills, and she specifically bought a rug to go under something. Since spills often occur during mealtime, it is reasonable to assume that the rug was purchased for a table. The other options do not relate to spills or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the smell is coming from the kitchen, which is typically where cupboards are located. Cupboards can sometimes contain food items that have gone bad and can produce stale smells if not properly disposed of. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the use of invitro is being considered as a solution to some kind of problem related to reproduction. This could refer to issues with fertility, genetic disorders, or other medical conditions that make it difficult or impossible to conceive and carry a child to term. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Walking barefooted on wet ground can lead to a higher risk of slipping and falling, as well as contracting infections from bacteria and parasites found in the moisture. Wet ground can also be more slippery than dry ground, increasing the risk of accidents. The other options do not address the potential hazards of walking barefooted after the rain.
The word "differences" suggests that there are multiple things being compared. To find the total or combined value of these differences, you would need to add them together, which is represented by the word "sum." The other answer choices imply a sense of similarity or likeness, which does not accurately reflect the concept of differences being added together.
The word "procreation" refers to the act of reproducing and creating offspring. In the context of this question, the term "success" is being used to describe a positive outcome when attempting to reproduce. The other options such as celebrating or having a party are not related to the process of procreation and do not make sense in the given context. Hearing a crowd go mad or creating success are also not relevant options in this context.
The word "janitor" implies that the person is responsible for cleaning and maintaining a building or facility. The options "kitchen," "hardware store," and "garage" are unlikely places for a janitor to keep their cleaning supplies. A "wishing well" is a decorative feature and not a practical location for a cleaning tool. A "utility room" is a room in a building dedicated to storing cleaning supplies, tools, and other necessary facilities maintenance equipment. Therefore, it is the most logical answer.
The sentence suggests that the doctor recommended washing hands, which is commonly associated with promoting health and preventing the spread of germs. Washing hands can help prevent the spread of illnesses and germs, which is why it is often recommended by doctors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cloth's usual location is somewhere specific and that they need to be put back there. The correct answer is likely a place where household linens are usually kept, such as a linen closet. The other options, such as the kitchen or a fabric store, do not make as much sense and are unlikely locations for household linens. Putting the cloth on a space heater is potentially dangerous, and the bedroom may or may not be the right location depending on the context of the situation.
Listening vinyl refers to vinyl records for listening to music. Record stores are where people usually buy vinyl records, as they specialize in selling music in physical formats. Safeway is a grocery store chain, and it is unlikely that they sell vinyl records. "Record albums" is a vague option that could refer to any place that sells music in physical and digital formats. "Car" and "wallpaper" have no connection to the context of buying vinyl records.
The word "peculiar" is often used to describe unusual or unexpected behavior, so in this case, it suggests that the side effects Sally experienced were not typical or expected. The other choices all have positive connotations and do not fit with the context of the sentence, which suggests that the side effects were not desirable.
The context of the sentence suggests that the student is sitting in front of keys, which is a common element of a piano. Playing the piano involves choosing and striking keys on the instrument, which corresponds to the action of sitting in front of black and white keys. The other options, such as talking or reading a book, do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the robot had a sudden ability to read books, suggesting that it had recently acquired this skill. This would imply that the robot had learned how to read, making "learn to read" the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The cabin in an airplane is the enclosed space where the passengers sit during the flight. The purpose of the cabin is to transport people safely and comfortably from one location to another. The other options do not accurately describe the purpose of the cabin.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is indicating where a pen can be purchased. The most likely location for purchasing a pen is an office supply store, which is specifically designed to sell office-related items, including pens. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking what the bean bag chair should be placed on, and the answer would likely be something sturdy and flat. The options 'house', 'den', and 'family room' all refer to indoor spaces where the chair might be located, but they do not answer the question about what the chair should sit on. 'Wood' is a material that might be used in furniture construction, but it does not indicate where the chair should be placed. 'Floor' is the most logical answer, as it is a flat and stable surface for furniture.
The sentence provides several clues that can help identify the correct answer. First, the city is located in Northern Norway and is known for its activities during the Polar Nights half marathon. Second, the city is situated in the middle of the Northern lights oval, which suggests that it is a popular destination for viewing the Northern Lights. The only city that meets these criteria is Tromsø. The other options may be cities in Norway, but they do not match the specific details provided in the sentence.
The other choices, such as college dorm, backpack, or classroom, do not typically sell binders. An office supply store is a place where individuals can purchase various office or school supplies, including binders.
The sentence suggests that James had a connection, which is commonly used to refer to a secondary flight that a passenger must catch in order to reach their final destination. Airports often have connecting flights, making it the most likely option among the choices given. The other options (company, wall, computer network, love) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a cleaning agent and disinfectant in chemistry labs. Safety glasses are also required in chemistry labs for eye protection during experiments. The other choices, such as a pub or restaurant, would not typically have isopropyl alcohol or safety glasses readily available. They are also not essential items for use in a park or supermarket setting.
The sentence suggests that the man was not able to run, which implies that he could still move using another method. It can be inferred that the only way the man could move was by walking, as it is the only option in the choices that involves movement other than standing still. The other options either do not involve movement or do not reflect the context of the sentence.
The sentence establishes that molecules make up everything you can "hold", implying something that can be physically grasped. The options "atom", "air", and "anything" do not necessarily fit this criteria, while "feet" is an odd choice that doesn't make logical sense. "Hands" is the most appropriate answer as it is part of the body that is used for physically holding things.
The term "foolhardy" implies recklessness or lack of thoughtfulness, so the opposite should be a trait that involves careful consideration and planning. Among the given choices, "thoughtful" and "discreet" could be related to being cautious, but they do not quite capture the sense of deliberate risk aversion that is implied. "Calculative" may suggest a certain level of rationality, but still lacks the connotation of prudence. "Careful" is the most fitting antonym of "foolhardy," as it denotes a state of being attentive and cautious in avoiding danger or mistakes.
The question suggests that the location being described is where one can both exercise and consume juice. The term "get in shape" typically refers to fitness activities, which aligns with the choice of "gym." The other options, such as "fridge," "limejuice," and "refrigerator," do not have any connection to the context of the question. "Square" is a possible distractor, but there is no indication in the question that it would be a relevant location.
The sentence suggests that the question is asking for a method or activity that allows people to meet or gather together. "Believe in god" and "pay bills" are not activities that necessarily involve socializing or meeting with others. "Enjoy themselves" may involve socializing, but it is not a specific method for people to meet each other. "Face each other" is a physical orientation and not an activity. "Group together" is the only option that directly suggests people coming together in a social context.
Horses are herbivores and their primary source of energy comes from the plants they eat, such as grass and hay. Playing and being kept in stables may be part of a horse's routine, but they do not directly contribute to their energy intake. "Dominated" is not a behavior that horses exhibit to get energy. Horses cannot drink coffee as it contains caffeine, which is harmful to them.
The sentence suggests that there are some people standing in a line near a road, which is a scene commonly seen at a bus stop as people wait in line for a bus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the museum put a stuffed koala somewhere where you would normally find a panda, which implies that the two animals share a similar habitat or environment. Pandas are known to live in bamboo forests, so it makes sense that the koala would be displayed in a bamboo grove. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "immediately" suggests that the answer is related to an immediate effect of exercising. Exercising is commonly known to boost energy levels and create a feeling of alertness and vigor, which fits the option "energetic". "Relaxation" is not typically an immediate effect of exercising, and "exhaustion" may occur after exercising for a prolonged period of time. "Becoming stronger" is a long-term goal of exercising rather than an immediate effect. "Using energy" is a vague option and does not necessarily relate to the immediate effect of exercising.
The sentence suggests that the person finds relaxation in a simple act that involves opening something up. Among the given choices, only "read book" fits this description. Reading a book involves opening it up and immersing oneself in the story, which can be a form of escape and relaxation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that one person has done something that has caused harm to another person. Feeling sorry is a common response to causing harm, as it indicates remorse and a desire to make amends. Trusting God, crossing the street, riding a bike, and lending money do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "something forbidden" suggests a reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where they were not allowed to eat from the tree of knowledge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question specifies that the food item must fit in your hand, which eliminates options like cupboard, chocolate, and coffee. The remaining options are candy bar and soda pop. While soda pop does have a lot of sugar, it is not necessarily a food that fits in your hand, especially since it usually comes in a can or bottle. Candy bars, on the other hand, are a common snack food that are often small enough to fit in your hand and are known for containing high amounts of sugar. Therefore, the correct answer is candy bar.
The term "reception area" is commonly associated with a space inside an office building where visitors wait before meeting with someone. The other options, such as hotels, motels, or law firms, may also have reception areas, but they are not as commonly associated with this term. A hall could refer to any type of hallway, so it doesn't specifically indicate a reception area.
The sentence suggests that the person in question was not skilled at dancing, so the instructor likely taught her something fundamental to improve her ability. Rhythmic movement is a basic dance skill that involves moving the body in time with the beat of the music. The other options are not related to basic dance skills and would not be helpful in improving someone's ability to dance.
The sentence suggests that Billy's mother tripped over one of his things in a specific location. The most logical location for this to happen in a house would be a hall, which is a commonly used passage between rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the student wants to hear what the professor is saying, indicating that their goal is to understand the lecture. The best way to achieve this goal is by actively listening to the professor. Taking notes can also help in retaining information, but it is not the primary action that would help the student to hear what the professor is saying. Completing a test or gaining experience are not relevant to the situation, and focus alone may not be sufficient for effective listening.
Going for a run is typically associated with exercise and physical activity. While it is possible to feel sore and tired after a run, the question is asking about how someone would feel after completing the activity. Feeling a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment is a common response to completing a workout or physical activity such as running. Falling down is not a likely outcome of going for a run and is therefore an incorrect answer.
The sentence suggests that the student is about to complete their education, which would indicate that they will no longer be attending school. The other options do not have a clear connection to graduating from school.
The sentence implies that there are certain societal expectations placed on adult people, and paying bills is a common responsibility associated with adulthood. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A broken icebox is an appliance that is no longer functional and is therefore considered to be a piece of junk or waste. Junk yards are locations where people can take their unwanted items, including appliances such as iceboxes, to be disposed of or salvaged. The other options are not relevant or appropriate places to dispose of a broken icebox - an antique store would likely not want a broken appliance, the graveyard is not a place for garbage, the kitchen is not a disposal site, and ice is not a disposal method.
The sentence suggests that Mary was known for being upfront and honest about her behavior, despite being described as "bad." This implies that honesty is a positive trait in Mary and may be the reason why people liked her. The other options, such as "excellent" or "worthy," do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information given. "Fun" and "choice" may be positive traits, but they do not have any clear connection to Mary's behavior or why people liked her.
Sea World is a well-known theme park that features aquatic animals and exhibits. One of the attractions at Sea World is the shark tunnel, which allows visitors to view sharks swimming above them in an enclosed, clear tunnel. While sharks can be found in various locations such as the South Pacific, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico, the question specifically mentions a clear tunnel, which suggests that the answer is Sea World, as it is the only option that directly relates to this feature.
The context of the sentence suggests that Dan believes getting in line would be the best choice because it would lead to less confusion. When people form orderly lines, it becomes easier to manage and control a crowd. This reduces confusion and helps everyone move through the line in an efficient manner. The other options are unlikely as they do not fit the context of the sentence or do not make sense in the given situation.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where actors are not paid. One of the most common places where unpaid actors may perform is in a school setting, such as in a school theater program or a drama club. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the competition involved holding an object with an extended arm, which suggests that the correct choice is likely to involve "holding" the object. The other options do not adequately address the action of maintaining a straight arm while sustaining the weight of an object. "Lift up" and "pick up" both involve the initial action of raising an object, while "lifting" does not specify that the arm must be extended straight out. "Hold onto" implies a tight grip rather than an extended arm.

The question specifically asks about a program, which suggests that the correct answer must be related to something that is broadcasted on TV. Among the choices given, only "television" is a medium for broadcasting programs. Concert, opera, and theater, while often televised, are not specific enough or appropriate given the context of the sentence. "Take class" is also not relevant to the question.
Velvet is a type of fabric, so the most logical place for someone to look for this material would be a fabric store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A bus station is often located in a central location within a city, usually in the city center. This is because it makes it convenient for passengers to access the station from different parts of the city, as well as to transfer between different bus routes. Schools, streets, and catching a bus may not necessarily be convenient locations for a bus station, and maps are simply tools used to locate or navigate to a bus station.
The sentence suggests that the crowd was not large, and the term "small group" best fits that description. The other options do not accurately reflect the size of the crowd mentioned in the sentence. Field and solitude refer to locations or feelings rather than group size, while alone and solitary imply an absence of other people altogether.
In this sentence, the word "dried" indicates that the silverware has been washed and needs to be stored somewhere until it's ready to be used. The most common place to store clean silverware is in a cupboard, where it can be easily accessed when needed. The other options - table, restaurant, kitchen, and sink - are not appropriate for storing silverware.
The sentence suggests that eggs were purchased from a store and brought home, indicating that they were likely packaged in a container that could be easily transported. The other options, such as a chicken coop or henhouse, are places where eggs are laid and collected, but not packaged for sale in stores. A supermarket is also unlikely to be the answer, as they typically sell pre-packaged eggs in egg cartons. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely egg carton.
The question is asking for the most logical place to leave an account book if you are leaving and do not need to bring it with you. Since the account book contains important financial information, it should be kept in a safe and secure location. Of the choices given, keeping it in a desk drawer would be the most suitable option, as a desk is a common place to keep important documents in an office setting. The other options, such as keeping it with an accountant or in a bank, may not be feasible if you are leaving for an extended period of time. The option of keeping it in a purse would not be a secure option for important financial information.
When clothes have developed an unpleasant odor, the best course of action is typically to air them out. This involves hanging them outside or in a well-ventilated area to allow fresh air to circulate through the fabric and neutralize any odors. The other options (hanging in the closet, sniffing, getting dirty, becoming soiled) are not effective solutions for dealing with smelly clothes.
Playing football is known to be a highly physical and competitive sport, which can lead to injuries and pain. However, the word "feel" in the question suggests that it is asking about emotional or psychological sensations rather than physical ones. Exhilaration is a common feeling associated with sports in general and football in particular, as the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of victory can create a sense of excitement and joy in players. The options "pain," "death," "getting hurt," and "get hurt" are all negative and do not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the wood underwent a process of fossilization, which is commonly referred to as petrification. Fossilization occurs when organic materials are replaced by minerals over time, resulting in a hard, rock-like substance. The other options do not accurately describe the process of fossilization or the resulting substance.
The question is asking for a specific type of store where someone can buy a teddy bear. A thrift store typically sells used items, so it is unlikely that they would have a large selection of new teddy bears. A bed, shelf, or home are not options for purchasing a teddy bear. A toy store, on the other hand, specializes in selling toys and would likely have a variety of teddy bears to choose from.
The question is asking about the negative consequence of being unable to learn. "Distress" is the most logical answer, as not being able to learn can lead to frustration, disappointment, and emotional discomfort. It is also possible that the inability to learn could impact effectiveness and educational achievements, but these options are not as directly related to the negative emotional experience suggested by the question. "Intelligence" and "a stupid" are not appropriate choices as they are not consequences, but rather intrinsic qualities that cannot be changed by one's ability to learn.
The question asks about who the government helps with schools. The correct answer would be school children because the government's primary responsibility is to provide education to its citizens, which includes school children. The other options, such as parents or those who require to pay taxes, would not be the primary beneficiaries of government help in this context.
The sentence provides context that the lost dog is in New England. New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the United States, so it would be the most likely choice for where the small dog would be found. The other options do not have any clear connection to New England or dogs being lost.
The word "bound" means to be tied together or held together in some way. Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question of how to hold loose papers together. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question. "Tighten" implies that the papers were loose because they were not secure enough, "packaged" implies that the papers are being prepared for transport, "faithful" is not related to the question at all, and "compact" does not relate to holding papers together.
The phrase "talking on the corner" suggests that the people in question were engaged in conversation with others who were also present on the corner. The other answer options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person was happy to find someone who was as unattractive as they were, implying that they themselves were not considered attractive. The only option that matches this context is "ugly," while the other choices all describe someone who is aesthetically pleasing or attractive.
The sentence suggests that the band enjoyed the excitement of their fans and their success, which indicates that they may have been known for their energetic performances. The phrase "hear the crowd go mad" specifically suggests that the band enjoyed the exhilaration of the audience's response at the beginning of each concert. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide any clear connection to the band's enjoyment of their success and fans.
The sentence suggests that there was a lot of talking during the brainstorming session, indicating that people were actively participating in sharing ideas and discussing different perspectives. The options "obtaining information" and "gathering of information" suggest a more passive role, whereas "sharing information" and "conversation" do not necessarily imply the collaborative and dynamic nature of a brainstorming session. Therefore, "exchange of ideas" is the best fit for the context given.
The word "owned" in the sentence suggests that the rulers belong to different people, which rules out "measure distance" as an option. "England" is not relevant to the context of the sentence, while "office" and "desk" suggest a specific location but do not specify where the rulers might be stored. "Drawer" is the most likely option as it is a common place to keep small items such as rulers and can be used by multiple individuals in a shared space such as a classroom or workplace.
The word "greasy" implies that the teens in question have oily skin. Grooming is often recommended to help manage oily skin by keeping it clean and reducing the buildup of excess oil. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to purchase something specific (barbecue sauces) and is seeking advice on where to buy them. The most logical option would be a retail store that specializes in selling food products, as they are likely to have a variety of different barbecue sauces to choose from. The other options (detroit, australia, michigan park, cafe) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to offer a wide selection of barbecue sauces.
The word "mammoth" suggests that this question is referring to a prehistoric animal, which is more likely to be found in a museum or exhibit rather than in a modern-day environment like a refrigerator or forest. The mention of NYC narrows down the options further, and the most likely place to find a mammoth exhibit in NYC is the American Museum of Natural History.
The word "put" and the mention of olives suggest that the question is asking about storage. The option "refrigerator" also indicates this. However, the clue "to prevent them from getting nearby food wet" suggests that the olives need to be contained separately. The option "jar" fits this description best as it is a container that can be sealed to keep the olives isolated from other foods. The other options do not offer a clear solution to the problem of keeping the olives dry.
The context of the sentence implies that there is a specific etiquette observed when dining at a formal place. One of these is to sit properly at the table. Being sociable, talking, and drinking may also be part of the experience, but they are not the main action being asked here. "Medium" does not make sense in the given context.
Ponds are typically small bodies of shallow water, often created by natural or man-made depressions in the ground. They are too small to be considered lakes, which are typically deeper and larger bodies of water. Swimming pools and children's pools are man-made and usually have a specific depth, while aquariums contain water specifically designed to support aquatic life and may have a variety of depths.
Nodding is a common nonverbal way of indicating agreement or understanding. It involves moving your head up and down, often in a subtle manner, to communicate agreement with or understanding of what someone else is saying. The other options don't make sense in the context of the question. "Like more" doesn't have any clear connection to indicating agreement, wearing rings is unrelated, and shaking hands can indicate agreement but it is more commonly used to greet someone or signify a deal has been reached. "Concordance" is a less common word that means agreement or harmony, but it is not a physical action that you would use to indicate agreement with someone.
The sentence suggests that James no longer wants to compete, indicating that he may be feeling a desire to quit or give up. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Pressure and trying harder suggest that James wants to continue competing but is experiencing difficulty, while death and winning or losing are unlikely to be the reasons why James wants to stop competing.
The sentence is giving advice on why it is important to wash your hands before eating. It explains that you do not want to get germs onto your food or inside your body. The logical part of the body where germs could enter is the mouth, which makes it the correct answer. The other choices are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the explorers discovered something valuable or significant that was buried and located deep within a central passage. The most likely option among the choices is a tomb, since tombs are often located underground or within central structures, and are associated with the burial of important people or treasures. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that a rosebush can be found in a specific location or feature. "In the ground" is the most straightforward and logical answer, as it is common knowledge that rose bushes are planted in soil. The other options may also have rose bushes, but they are not as specific, and there is no direct evidence or association between them and the presence of a rose bush.
The sentence suggests that the man was driving himself to the airport, indicating that he likely had his luggage with him in the car. The trunk of a car is a common place to store luggage while driving, making it the most likely answer choice. The other options, such as a closet or sidewalk, do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while leaving the luggage at a hotel or bus stop would not be practical if the man was driving himself to the airport.
The question suggests that the gift is not a common or typical one, which means it is likely to be different or unusual in some way. The word "unique" means "one of a kind" or "unusual," so if someone receives a gift that is not common, they are likely to feel that it is unique. The other options either do not fit the context or have a negative connotation, such as feeling offended.
The question states that the banjo has its roots in the Caribbean, but the word "most famous" implies that it gained widespread popularity somewhere else. The United States is well-known for its strong tradition of banjo music, particularly in genres like bluegrass and folk. The other options, such as music shops, jug bands, or nice people, are not relevant to the history or popularity of the banjo.
The sentence suggests that the small print is causing discomfort or pain to the reader's eyes. Eye strain is a common consequence of reading small font for extended periods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that forgiveness can lead to the activation of a hidden force in one's life. "Karma" is often associated with cause and effect, where good actions lead to positive outcomes and bad actions lead to negative outcomes. Forgiveness is seen as a positive action that can lead to positive outcomes, thus activating good karma. The other options, while potentially positive outcomes of forgiveness, do not have a clear association with the idea of a hidden force being activated.
The question mentions keeping track of mistakes in baseball, which suggests that the answer is related to a term used to track mistakes. The answer "perfection" does not fit this context as it implies the absence of mistakes, whereas the question is specifically asking about tracking mistakes. "Happiness" and "sore muscles" are unrelated to the context and "injury" is related to a negative aspect of the game, but not specifically related to tracking mistakes.
The word "begin" suggests that the question is asking about the initial steps required to start creating art. Relaxation is a common prerequisite for creative work, as the mind and body need to be in a calm and receptive state to tap into one's imaginative resources. The other options do not seem directly related to the process of artistic creation.
The question implies that a reception with many people attending requires a spacious venue. The options that fit this requirement are large room, country club and grand casino. However, country clubs and grand casinos are known to be more expensive compared to large rooms, and restaurants and lobbies usually have smaller spaces. Therefore, the best choice would be a large room.
The question is asking for a solution to the problem of pens not working. The option "ink cartridges" is the most likely correct answer because it is a common cause of pens not working. Ink cartridges can become clogged or run out of ink, which can prevent the pen from writing properly. The other options, such as "take notes" or "scribble," do not address the problem of the pens not working, while the option "caps" may help prevent the pens from drying out but does not solve the current problem.
Architects are professionals who specialize in designing buildings, while builders and tradesmen are typically involved in the actual construction process. A driver has no direct connection to designing or building a building. "Fall down" is not a valid option as it is not a profession or role in the building process.
A bay is a body of water partially enclosed by land and connected to a larger body of water, such as an ocean. It is typically found in coastal areas where there are geographical features, such as peninsulas or capes, that create a space for a bay to form. Therefore, the correct answer is "coastal area", while the other options do not fit the definition of a bay.
The sentence suggests that people are engaged in a particular pastime while they are traveling along a liquid. The closest match to this context is sailboats, as they are designed to travel on liquid (water) and often provide a recreational activity for those on board. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the location being described is a place where a movie theater and other stores are situated together. The most common place where this arrangement can be found is in a large shopping mall, which typically contains numerous stores and entertainment options like movie theaters, restaurants, and arcades. The other options are not as likely to offer this combination of amenities, making shopping mall the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the man on the street corner was trying to sell his wristwatch in order to get money to buy drugs. "Hock" is a slang term for pawning something, and a pawn shop would be the most likely place for someone to try to sell an item quickly for cash. The other options (jewelry store, case, watch store) do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not places where someone would sell an item quickly for cash, especially for drug money.
Home Depot is a well-known retailer for home improvement and building supplies, including flooring options. Walmart and kitchen are unlikely options for flooring purchases, while house and loft are too general and do not necessarily refer to specific retailers or places to buy flooring.
The sentence suggests that Bill was waking up, so the physiological response that would be occurring at this moment is the opening of his eyes. The other options may be related to how he feels (tiredness, grogginess, discomfort) or what he is doing (getting out of bed), but they do not directly relate to the process of waking up that is being described in the sentence.
The word "buying" suggests that the person is voluntarily purchasing beer, and the word "pleasure" is typically associated with consuming alcoholic beverages. The other options, such as "get arrested" and "problems," suggest negative consequences associated with drinking alcohol, while the option "sober" suggests the opposite of why someone might want to buy beer. "Intoxication" is a possible reason, but the word carries a negative connotation, while "pleasure" is a more neutral term that better fits the context.
The sentence suggests that the person is using a radio to communicate with a base, which indicates that they are likely in a remote location or some kind of vehicle. The options vessel and submarine suggest they might be on a boat or a submarine, but those options do not fit the context of reaching a base. The option lamp has no apparent connection to the sentence. Box could potentially refer to a portable radio, but the most likely option in this context is transistor as it is a common type of radio used for communication in remote locations.
The sentence suggests that the pizza was left in the oven for an hour, which is a long enough time for it to become overcooked or burnt. The option "smell smoke" could be a possible outcome if the pizza was left in the oven for too long and began to burn, but it does not directly answer the question based on the context of the sentence. "Catch cold," "look angry," and "bank savings" do not have any clear connection to the sentence.
The sentence implies that touching the wild animals could lead to a negative consequence, and the most likely one is that they could bite. Wild animals are not accustomed to being touched by humans and may perceive it as a threat, leading them to defend themselves by biting. The other options do not make sense or are unlikely in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Danny does not enjoy helping people, which suggests that it brings negative consequences. The word "complications" indicates that helping others causes difficulties or problems for Danny. The other options all suggest positive outcomes, which do not fit with the negative tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is not satisfied with their current job and wants to make more money, implying that finding a better job with a higher salary would be the best solution. Owning a house, winning the lottery, saving money, and feeling safe may all be desirable goals, but they are not directly related to finding a way to make more money at work.
The sentence suggests that seeing beautiful clouds can evoke a particular sensation or emotion, but none of the options provided fit that description. A more appropriate option might be something like "inspired" or "enamored" as clouds can often inspire creativity or awe in people. The other options do not accurately reflect the positive experience of seeing beautiful clouds.
The question is asking where you can see animals as a human in a large northeastern city, indicating that the animals are not likely to be found roaming free. The zoo is a common place to see a variety of animals in captivity, making it the most relevant choice. The workplace, sky, and New York City do not have any clear connection to seeing animals, while "many places" is too vague to be a specific answer.
The context of the question suggests that the choices are related to activities that one would typically do in a bank. "Make noise" and "have tea" are unlikely options, as they are not related to banking activities. "Take time" could be possible, but is too generic to be the best option. "Make time" could also be possible, but it is less specific to banking activities. Therefore, "make payments" is the most appropriate answer, as it is a common activity that one would do in a bank, such as paying bills, depositing or withdrawing money, or transferring funds.
Fungus is often found growing on decaying matter, which could be a clue in choosing the correct answer. Milk is a common ingredient in cheese production, and if the cheese is left to age or become old, it is possible for fungus to grow on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the snake prefers warm and sunny weather as its habitat. New Mexico is a southwestern state in the United States that is known for its desert climate and warm temperatures, so it is likely that this would be a suitable habitat for a snake. The other options are not likely to have the same climate features that a snake would prefer, so they can be eliminated.
The sentence states that John preferred glass, suggesting that he does not like plastic. He also wishes he was somewhere else, which implies that he is unhappy in his current environment. The option "anywhere else" best fits this context, as it implies a desire to be in a different, unspecified location. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person went to "examine" the thing, which implies an intention to gain knowledge or understanding about it. The other options such as "eat cake", "buy", "interests", and "complex" do not fit the context of examining something.
The question implies that a metal rod is a common component in a mode of transportation, and specifically in the preferred method of transportation for most people. Airplanes commonly have metal rods as part of their structure, such as the wings and the fuselage. Construction sites may also have metal rods, but they are not typically associated with transportation. Shops and broken bones are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. While engines may contain metal rods, this is not a characteristic that most people would associate with their preferred method of transportation.
The sentence suggests that the man did not have anything to put the cup on, thus indicating the need for a coaster. A coaster is an object that is often used to place a cup or glass on to protect the table or surface it is resting on. The other options, such as hands or tenacity, do not relate to the context of the sentence as they are not items that can be used to balance a cup on a table.
The context of the question implies that the person is looking for a place to purchase a glass of wine, and bars are common establishments where alcoholic beverages are served. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The context indicates that the focus is on enjoying someone's company, which is typically associated with socializing and spending time together in a non-professional setting. While some people may enjoy socializing at work or in the office, these locations are not typically associated with leisure time or relaxation. "Deep thought" is not a location at all, but rather a state of mind or activity. "Friend's house" is the only option that makes sense in the context of leisurely socializing.
The sentence suggests that Brad ordered a typical breakfast consisting of eggs and toast, which is often accompanied by a beverage such as coffee. The other options do not make sense in the context of a breakfast order, and are unlikely to be what Brad would choose to drink.
The sentence suggests that the location serves green drinks and has a locker room, which is commonly found in health clubs or gyms. Health clubs are known for offering healthy drinks and amenities such as locker rooms, saunas, and showers for members to freshen up after a workout. The other options may have a locker room, but they do not typically have green drinks or focus on health and fitness.
The sentence suggests that when humans need money, they are motivated to do something specific. The answer choice "work hard" is the most logical option, as it is commonly associated with people who need to earn money. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the sentence and are unlikely actions that people take when motivated by money.
The sentence indicates that the person referred to as Billy is not a stranger, but they haven't talked to him frequently. The phrase "known person" can encompass anyone who is not a stranger but may not necessarily be a family member or friend. The other options either do not fit or overlap with the concept of a known person.
Building a bridge requires engineering knowledge and skills, so studying engineering would be the most appropriate choice for someone who wants to learn how to build a bridge. Dancing, talking, playing the piano, and answering a question do not have any connection to bridge building.
The question suggests that the activity of reading newspapers while traveling to work is something people commonly do in a particular location. The subway is a common form of public transportation in many cities, and people often read newspapers or other materials while riding it. In contrast, reading newspapers on the front lawn or at a bookstore or library does not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the janitor retrieved their bucket of sawdust from a location within the cafeteria, as they needed it to clean up the mess. A utility closet is a common location for janitorial supplies within a building such as a school cafeteria. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that doing housework can lead to a certain outcome that does not involve pain. While stress, backache, and low pay are all negative outcomes that can result from doing housework, becoming tired is a common and expected outcome. Housework can involve physical exertion and repetitive tasks, which can lead to fatigue and exhaustion. Putting on shoes is not necessarily related to housework and does not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "wet" suggests that the marmoset is already in a wet or damp environment, which would not make it happy. Therefore, we can assume that the answer must be something that will counteract the wetness and make the marmoset comfortable. Of the choices given, only a warm climate could achieve this, as it would help the marmoset dry off and regulate its body temperature. The other options (rain, France, shopping mall, great outdoors) do not address the issue of the marmoset being wet and would not necessarily make it happy.
The sentence suggests that math competitions are not primarily for students who find the subject difficult, but for those who enjoy it or find it fun. This implies that math competitions are a way for students to further engage with and challenge themselves in a subject they already enjoy, rather than a way for struggling students to improve their skills. The other options are not consistent with the idea that math competitions are primarily enjoyable or engaging for participants.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to people celebrating in a bar. Drinking alcohol is a common activity in bars, especially during celebrations, and it is not uncommon for people to drink too much and become intoxicated. Eating cake and having sex are not necessarily related to celebrating in a bar and may be uncommon activities in such a setting.
The sentence suggests that Sam is underground where there is likely no direct or full sunlight, and brightness or bright light may not be expected either. Since he is shading his eyes, it implies that he needs to adjust to a sudden change in lighting. The use of the word "unexpected" also indicates that the lighting source is not typical or commonplace, which rules out direct or full sunlight. The only option that fits this scenario is the moon, which can provide a natural but unexpected source of light in underground areas.
Children are not developmentally ready or mature enough to engage in sexual activities. Orgasm, pregnancy, and herpes do not determine who is likely or unlikely to have sex as they are related to aspects of sexual activity such as pleasure, reproduction and sexually transmitted infections. Human is not a relevant option as all humans are capable of having sex.
Committing murder is a serious and often violent act, which can cause a range of different emotions. Fear is a common emotion associated with committing murder, as the person may be afraid of getting caught or facing consequences such as going to jail. The other options do not accurately describe the emotions associated with committing murder.
The sentence suggests that the children are tired from running, which makes it unlikely that they would choose to ride a bike or play tag. Watching television and smelling smoke are not relevant options for getting somewhere. Walking is a logical choice when tired from running as it is a slower and less strenuous form of transportation.
A period is a punctuation mark used to indicate the end of a sentence. Therefore, it is likely to be on a page when a sentence is written. The other options are not related to the context of the question or the function of a period in writing.
The options "electrical circuit", "canteen", and "Mexico" are unlikely choices for getting a cup of coffee. "Coffee shop" is a possibility, but the sentence suggests a preference for a more traditional or retro atmosphere. "Diner" is a common type of restaurant that often serves classic diner fare such as coffee and pie, and is therefore the most appropriate choice for a good place to get an old fashioned cup of coffee.
The sentence suggests that the person is seeking a sensation related to breathing fresh air. "Reviving" is the most appropriate choice because it implies a sense of rejuvenation, which is often associated with taking a break from polluted environments. The other options do not accurately describe the sensation of breathing fresh air in the countryside.
The sentence suggests that the student left their writing instrument in a place where they were studying. The most likely place for a student to leave their writing instrument would be the classroom, where they were taking their classes. The other options are not likely places for a student to leave their writing instrument, as a desk drawer or pocket would require the student to remove it from their possession and a bathroom or stationery store would mean the student left the classroom entirely.
The sentence suggests that employees want to discuss something as a group, which is commonly done through a meeting. A meeting is a formal gathering where people can discuss and exchange ideas, which makes it the most appropriate option among the choices given. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as 'talk' is too vague and can suggest informal discussion, 'company' and 'corporation' refer to a business entity rather than an action or situation, and 'office' is too general and could refer to the physical space rather than a specific activity.
The sentence suggests that some people find doing housework to be a burden or something they do not enjoy, which can be described as "one big" something. The option "work" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to the context of the sentence. The other options (asthma, headache, arguments, boredom) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The scale is commonly used to weigh oneself, and it is typically kept in a private space where people can have access to it whenever they want to weigh themselves. The bathroom is the most common location for a scale as it is a private area within the home, and it is convenient for most people to use the scale after their morning routine. The other options, such as doctor's office, assay office, post office, or study, are not commonly associated with personal weighing scales.
Apple trees produce beautiful flowers before they turn into fruit. This is a well-known characteristic of apple trees and is commonly associated with them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question implies that the mail needs to be placed somewhere inside the house. The most common place to put mail that has just been brought in from outside is on a table or countertop. Placing it in the neighbor's house or post office doesn't make sense, and the fridge and bathroom are not usual places to store mail.
The sentence suggests that a grain of sand can cause pain and damage to a person's sight, which is a characteristic commonly associated with getting sand in one's eye. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Tomato sauce is a common ingredient on pizzas, making it a logical choice for the correct answer. While tomato sauce may be sold in markets and stored in refrigerators, those options don't necessarily connect to the context of the question, nor do growing tomatoes in a vegetable garden or using it in a cake.
The sentence suggests that there is a physical manifestation of someone having fun, which can be seen on their face. One common way that people express joy and happiness is through smiling, which involves the contraction of facial muscles to pull the corners of the mouth upward. The other options are not related to the physical expression of happiness or fun on someone's face.
The question is asking specifically about a meal that would be served in the evening. Brunch is typically served in the late morning or early afternoon, so it is not a correct answer. Fast food restaurant is also not a meal but rather a type of establishment. "Appear appetizing" is not a meal at all. Plate is not a meal, but rather a piece of serving ware. Therefore, the correct answer is likely dinner, which is a commonly served meal in the evening.
The sentence implies that there is something that dogs can be taught to do, which narrows down the options to those that have to do with training or behavior. "Shake hands" is a common trick that many dog owners teach their pets, making it the correct answer. "Accident" and "stray" are not related to dog behavior or training, "guard house" is not something dogs are typically trained to do, and while "drink water" is a normal behavior for a dog, it is not something they need to be taught to do.
The phrase "hair of the dog" is often used to refer to a hangover cure that involves drinking more alcohol the morning after heavy drinking. Therefore, it makes sense that the people in the sentence who love beer would refer to it as "hair of the dog." The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context or meaning of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person burped loudly with satisfaction, which suggests that they had eaten a satisfying and filling meal. The phrase "well fed" means that someone has had plenty to eat and is therefore satisfied. The other options do not provide any clear explanation for why the person would burp with satisfaction.
The question mentions that Bill is picking apples from a tree in southern Michigan. This means that the correct answer must be a location within Michigan. The other options listed are all locations in different states and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence mentions a freon coin, which is commonly used in refrigeration systems to charge the unit with coolant. This suggests that the item being discussed is related to refrigeration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about the emotions someone might feel after hurting someone else. Empowering and luck are unlikely as these are positive emotions and hurting someone else is generally considered a negative action. Punishment may be an outcome, but it is not an emotion. Despair is also possible, but regret is a more accurate answer as it is commonly understood that hurting someone else can lead to feelings of remorse and regret.
The question is asking about what a teacher does most during a week, which suggests that the answer would be related to their job responsibilities. Out of the given options, "work in school" is the most general and broad answer that would encompass a wide range of tasks a teacher may perform during a typical week, such as planning lessons, grading papers, communicating with parents or colleagues, attending meetings, etc. The other options are either too specific (demonstrate, time test, eat lunch) or too vague (school children) to accurately capture the main activities of a teacher during a week.
The question is asking specifically about pens with a company logo, which suggests that this is a promotional or business-related item. The most likely place to find such pens would be in an office, where they might be given as gifts to clients or employees or used for marketing purposes. The other options such as "on a pencil" and "backpack" are unlikely to have pens with a company logo, and the options "write sentences on paper" and "school" don't provide any context for the specific type of pen being asked about.
The question implies that the answer is a concept or intangible element that can encompass the entire world. "Thought" fits this description and suggests that the world is full of ideas and mental processes. The other options are more concrete and limited in scope. "Countries" are only a small portion of the world, "water" only covers the earth's surface, "universe" only applies to the cosmos beyond earth, and "galaxy" refers only to a specific grouping of stars.
A card catalog lists the items available in a library and is organized alphabetically by author, title, and subject. To find information in an old library, one would need to search for it in the card catalog using the author, title, or subject. Chewing, ask questions, and logic are not relevant to the process of using a card catalog to find information in a library. Time may be required, but the question specifically asks about the process of finding information in a card catalog.
The sentence suggests that Gary made a practical investment before going off to the tournament. The fact that the company is a fortune 500 company suggests that it is a well-established and profitable business. The fact that he bought a new item in addition to the stock suggests that he had some spare cash to invest in something more immediate or enjoyable. A fishing rod is a common item for someone to buy before going off on a trip, and it also fits with the idea of making a practical investment in a potentially profitable stock. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that fencing is a sport, which requires the use of a noun that is associated with sports. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The word "sword" is typically associated with fencing as it refers to the weapon used in the sport. A sword is a long, thin, pointed metal weapon that is used for thrusting or slashing in historical combat or modern sports like fencing.
The sentence suggests that someone is watching "garbage reality shows," which are typically broadcasted on television. The other options, such as trashcan, floor, toronto, and microwave, do not make sense in the context of watching television shows.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is visiting a foreign city and doesn't have access to their own computer. Based on this, the most logical answer would be an internet cafe, as this is a common place where people can access computers when they don't have their own. The other options, such as school, office building, and hell, do not make sense in this context. Despair is an emotional state and not a physical location.
The sentence suggests that the fire extinguisher is really big, which means it will need to be stored in a location with enough space to accommodate it. The options of school bus, car, and hospital are unlikely, as these are not typical locations for storing fire extinguishers. The stairwell may be too narrow to store a large fire extinguisher, making the garage the best option as it provides ample space and is commonly used for storage.
A basketball must be inflated with air in order to be used properly. Therefore, the options "full of air" and "round" are not correct. "Popular in America" and "not tall" do not provide any relevant information to why a basketball could not be used. The option "punctured" is the correct answer as a punctured basketball would not hold air and would be unable to bounce or be used effectively.
The question is asking for a location where an automobile can get somewhere faster than usual. The fast lane is a lane on a highway that is designated for faster-moving traffic, making it the logical choice for this question. The other options do not involve driving quickly or efficiently, such as driving on the side of the road, in a parking garage, or in a garage. Street is a possibility, but it is a broad term and does not necessarily imply speed or efficiency.
The sentence compares the college student's preference for reading during her free time with her roommates' preference for something else. The phrase "on the other hand" indicates a contrast, which suggests that the roommates' preference is different from the college student's. The most logical option based on this information is "watching tv" since it is a common leisure activity that is often done in a shared space, like a college dorm room. The options "listening" and "sleeping" do not provide enough information to infer a contrast with reading, while "illiterate" and "illiteracy" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Wild cats are typically found in their natural habitat, which is the wilderness or nature. They are not commonly found in domestic settings like on the floor or in warm places like indoors. They may be in trouble if their habitat is threatened or if they are hunted, but this is not a general characteristic of their presence. A dog's mouth is not a suitable place for wild cats as dogs are predators and may harm the cats.
Entering school is the typical first step in becoming a student and beginning formal education. The other options do not make sense in this context - dropping out of school would mean the child is not a student, washing dishes and reading a book are not typically requirements for becoming a student, and "study book" is not a grammatically correct phrase.
A mart, supermarket, and grocery store are all places where you can take home items that need to be carried in bags. A relative's home may also give you items to take home, but it's not a public place. However, you wouldn't need a shopping bag at a restaurant unless you had leftover food that you didn't finish and wanted to take home with you. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant.
The question asks what killing is "usually thought of as", suggesting that the answer has to do with common perceptions or beliefs about the act of killing. "Premeditated" is a common legal term for when someone plans a killing in advance, and is often associated with more serious charges and penalties. The other options do not fit as well with the question, as "funeral" and "remorse" are consequences of killing rather than how it is thought of, and "horrible" and "going to jail" are more general descriptors that could apply to many things.
Learning about science is often associated with gaining knowledge and understanding of natural phenomena, laws of the universe, and technological advancements. The other options, such as headache or accidents, are not typically associated with learning science. Appreciation of nature could be a potential benefit of learning science, but it is not as direct as gaining increased knowledge. Seeing things differently may also occur, but this is not exclusive to learning science and it is not a guaranteed outcome.
The sentence implies that the introduction of industry had a broad impact on human life and society, suggesting that the correct answer relates to a significant change or development in human history. The option describing poverty is unlikely to be correct, as industrialization often leads to greater economic growth and a decline in poverty rates. The other options may be related to industry but do not fully capture the overall impact on human life and society. "Civilization" is the best answer as it suggests that the introduction of industry led to a transformation in the way humans organized themselves and created a more complex social structure.
The sentence suggests that the cat saw animal control approaching and had to make a decision. Running away is a common response for animals when they feel threatened, and the fact that the cat sees animal control approaching implies that there may be a reason for her to feel threatened. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "over indulgent" suggests that the punishment for this behavior would be one of self-denial, such as practicing restraint or limiting oneself in some way. The other options all suggest external punishments imposed by others, which do not fit the context of the sentence.
Towels are commonly used at swimming pools to dry off after swimming or lounging on a poolside chair. While they could be brought to a hotel or motel, the question specifically asks for a location where the towels would be used, not just stored or brought to. The beach is another possibility, but the question implies that the towels would be brought somewhere specific, not just for general use at any beach. Stored on a towel rack is not a location where the towels would be brought, but rather where they would be stored.
The question asks what people typically do if they are near the sea, and one common activity associated with the sea is fishing. Fishing is a popular pastime for many people who live near the coast or visit the beach, and it provides a source of food and enjoyment. While some people may write stories or talk to each other near the sea, these activities are not as closely associated with the context of the question as fishing is. Additionally, the options of dying of starvation or eating fish are not valid choices, as they are not activities that people choose to do near the sea.
An army captain is a military rank, so it is natural to assume that they would be found in a military setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. An airplane cabin may be used by many professions, but an army captain would not typically be found there. Similarly, a basketball team may have a captain, but they would not be referred to as an army captain, nor would they typically be found on a basketball team. A battleship or fleet may be associated with the military, but it is not clear that an army captain would specifically be found on a battleship or among a fleet of ships.
The question pertains to horror movies, which typically involve violence and death. The term "die" suggests that the people in question are killed, and the context of horror movies supports the idea that they are likely murdered in a violent or gruesome manner. The other options do not fit with the context of the question, since they do not pertain to horror movies or deaths.
The sentence suggests that the man has a preference for old cheese, indicating that he enjoys a stronger, more complex flavor. Cheese is known to improve with age, as the bacteria naturally present in the cheese continue to break down the fats and proteins. Additionally, certain types of cheese are intentionally aged to enhance their flavor, such as cheddar or gouda. The other options, such as "eat cake" or "salad dressing," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person didn't have a clean plate to eat from, so they used an alternate dish. The most common dish used as an alternative to a plate would be a bowl. Saucers are typically used as a side dish for tea or coffee, forks are an eating utensil, cups are used for drinking, and food is not a dish, but rather what is being eaten.
Garlic is well-known for causing a strong odor in the breath, especially when consumed raw or in high quantities. Therefore, the sentence suggests that eating garlic for breakfast could lead to bad breath. The other options are not relevant to the context and do not have any connection to the effects of garlic consumption.
The sentence suggests that the mountain was part of a larger geographical feature, which is described as "surrounding" something else. The only option that fits this description is "plains". The other options do not convey the idea of a surrounding geographical feature. A "molehill" is too small, a "field" is not high enough, a "dale" is a valley rather than a feature that surrounds something, and while mountains can create climbing challenges, this option does not fit with the surrounding context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the class was meant to help individuals improve themselves, which is often associated with meditation practices. The instructor specifically asks everyone to close their eyes, which is a common practice during meditation. The other answer choices do not align with the sentence's context, as celebrating or plotting destruction would not typically be associated with self-improvement, and eating better and feeling better about oneself do not relate specifically to the action of closing one's eyes.
The sentence suggests that a hinged door is commonly found in most rooms of a house or building, except for one specific room. The options "jamb" and "own house" do not refer to a specific room, while "kitchen" and "building" are common places where hinged doors are found. However, washing machines usually do not have hinged doors but rather a front-loading or top-loading configuration, making it the correct answer.
Blowfish are a type of fish that are typically found in saltwater environments, such as oceans and coral reefs. Coral reefs provide blowfish with ample protection from predators while also offering a variety of food sources, making it an ideal habitat for them. The other choices do not offer the necessary environment for a blowfish to survive, as they are not found in palm trees, books, fish markets, or aquariums in the wild.
Footprints would not typically be left on a carpet or rug if they were worn by a person's shoes. The surface of the earth includes various environments where footprints could be left, such as in mud, sand, or snow. However, the question specifies "man-made item," so this choice is less likely. The ground is a vague term and does not specifically refer to a man-made object. However, footprints could be left on a flat or sloped surface, such as a roof.
The sentence suggests that there is some kind of action that a country can take out of jealousy that a person cannot. Given the context of the phrase "jealousy," it is reasonable to assume that the action is negative or aggressive in nature. Therefore, "wage war" is the most likely correct answer, as countries have historically gone to war based on feelings of jealousy towards other nations. The other options do not have a strong connection to jealousy or aggressive behavior.
Attending school is commonly associated with improving one's education and skillset, which in turn can increase their employability or ability to obtain a job. The other options, such as dropping out or catching a cold, do not have any clear correlation to the benefits of attending school. Getting paid may be a result of attending school and obtaining qualifications, but it is not a direct benefit. Graduating is a potential outcome of attending school, but it doesn't encompass all the benefits of education.
The phrase "back garden" is a term commonly used in British English to refer to the yard or garden at the back of a house. Therefore, the answer is likely to be related to an area in which this term is frequently used, such as suburban neighborhoods in England. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the children enjoyed the movie and started to play a game of pretending to be characters from the movie. The word "pretend" is used in the sentence to indicate this game. The other options, such as "cry," "go to movie," "stand in line," and "wait in line," do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence is referring to a feature that is found on all mammal skin, and the choices provided all relate to different features that can be found on the skin or within the body. Nipples, for example, are not found on all mammal skin, while spinal cords are not a feature of the skin at all. Fur and hair are both features that can be found on many mammals, but the sentence specifies that only one is correct. In this case, hair is the correct answer as it is commonly found on all mammal skin, while fur is a type of hair that is specific to certain animals.
A potluck is an event where everyone brings a dish of food to share with others. The emphasis is on communal sharing and everyone contributes to the meal. Therefore, the correct answer is share food. The other choices do not fit the context of potlucks.
The sentence indicates that the investor had promised profit but did not deliver. Instead, the investor was "losing" money, which implies that they were experiencing a decline in their investments. The other choices, such as "lost" or "losses," also suggest a decline in investments but do not necessarily convey the ongoing nature of the problem that is implied by "losing money." "Expense" and "lose money" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that someone might still be able to learn even if they don't continue going to school. Continuing to learn is a lifelong process that can happen outside of formal schooling, through reading, exploring new hobbies, or even just talking to other people. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Triangles are a common shape studied in geometry, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects in space. While mathematics and math class are broad terms that could potentially include geometry, they do not specifically identify the use of triangles. Math book and university are also too broad and do not provide any specific information related to triangles.
Going to space requires the use of specialized vehicles, such as rockets or space shuttles, that are designed to launch spacecraft into orbit. The other options are not suitable for space travel and do not have any connection to the context of the question.
Listening involves actively paying attention to what someone else is saying, processing the information, and responding appropriately. Simply being able to hear someone's words is not enough to be considered listening. Being very quiet can be helpful in listening, but it is not the skill itself. "Shut up" is inappropriate and implies not allowing someone to speak, which is the opposite of listening. "Hatred" has no connection to the question at hand.
The statement suggests that the purpose of the product was not related to selling but instead related to demonstrating something. Products that are used for demonstrations are often given away for free or not intended for sale. The other choices do not fit the context of the statement, as they do not provide any information about the purpose of the product.
Hospitals are typically located in urban areas, which would eliminate options like every state, military base, and doctor. Detroit is a specific city and may not be a representative answer, leaving most cities as the most likely choice.
The sentence suggests that there is a distinction between being in your home country and being in another country. The word "not" indicates that the answer should be the opposite of "home country." "Foreign" is the only option that describes being in another country, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions "children" and "bicycles," which suggests a school setting. The word "leave" implies temporary storage rather than permanent parking, which makes "schoolyard" the most logical choice. "Street" and "behind" are unlikely options for a safe place to store bicycles. "Netherlands" and "university" are not mentioned in the sentence and do not provide any context for the answer.
The question is asking for something that a computer is unable to do, so we need to eliminate any choices that are possible for a computer to do. A computer is capable of processing information and making decisions, so those options can be eliminated. Computers also cannot cast shadows, but this is not necessarily a defining characteristic of what a computer cannot do. However, becoming sensible is something that is exclusive to humans and cannot be replicated by computers or machines. Therefore, the correct answer is "become sensible."
Standing up typically requires the use of one's legs and feet to push upwards. Balance and effort may be important factors in maintaining stability and exerting force, but they are not the primary physical components involved in standing up. Hands and courage are not relevant to the physical act of standing up.
The question is asking where to put a teaspoon when it is not in use, which suggests a storage location. None of the other options are for storage, and "in mouth" and "eating" suggest actively using the teaspoon. "Cup of coffee" and "coffee cup" may be where a teaspoon would be located during use, but not where it would be stored when not in use. Therefore, the correct answer is "kitchen drawer."
The sentence suggests that lighting a candle can help create a romantic atmosphere, and the choice of "dimly lit room" fits this context best. A dimly lit room can create a cozy and intimate atmosphere, which is often associated with romance. The other options, such as a synagogue or birthday cake, do not have the same association with romantic settings.
Since the question is asking where you wouldn't find a grape, the answer is likely to be a place where grapes are not typically found. While grapes are often used in cooking, they are not typically found in a kitchen on their own. Grapes come from fields or vineyards, and they are usually sold at fruit stands or used in wineries. They may also be served on a plate as a snack or part of a meal, but they would not be found in a kitchen unless someone had brought them in from another location.
The sentence suggests that the person is excited to be in a region that actually has snow, which indicates that they may come from a place where it doesn't snow often or at all. The word "winter" is synonymous with snow and is the only option that directly relates to the idea of snow. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A window is typically placed on a wall in a house to allow natural light to come in and provide a view of the outside. Restrooms and classrooms may have windows, but they are often smaller or higher up and serve different purposes. Building and space shuttle may have windows, but they are not relevant to the context of a house.
The sentence suggests that the activity of working in a vegetable garden happens in a specific location. The phrase "everyday" also suggests that this location is accessible and convenient. The term "backyard" is the only choice that fits this criteria, while the other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the bus stop implemented a size restriction for luggage suggests that it is a stop for a mode of transportation that involves air travel. Airports often have restrictions on the size and weight of luggage that passengers can bring on their flights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Laughter is often associated with humor or something that is funny. If something surprising is also funny, it can cause someone to laugh. The other options (fight, accidents, bad news, frightened) do not typically elicit laughter as a response.
The sentence indicates that the person being referred to retired from a command post after serving for twenty years. "Serve" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as it suggests that the person was in a leadership position and fulfilled their duties for a significant amount of time before deciding to retire. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as they do not suggest a leadership or command position.
The sentence suggests that the person is having a positive experience seeing new things, which implies that they are feeling something positive. Fear and anger do not align with a positive experience, while curiosity and wonder may be neutral or positive, but excitement is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a high level of positive emotion and energy.
An empty dish is usually stored in the kitchen cabinet, which is a designated space for storing dishes and other kitchenware. The other options such as restaurant, pantry, table, and glass are not typical locations for storing empty dishes in a household setting.
The sentence suggests that two people are about to return to work, and it implies that there is something they might do beforehand. Of the options given, "conversation" makes the most sense, as it is a common activity people engage in before going back to work. Anxiety, depression, and fighting are negative actions that people wouldn't want to be doing before going back to work, and earning money doesn't make sense in the context given.
The fact that James bought a hide bed sofa suggests that he is living in a space where efficiency is important, such as an apartment. Typically, people living in houses or villages have more space and do not have to prioritize space efficiency in their furniture choices. Similarly, someone living in a hotel would not have a need for a hide bed sofa, as their accommodations are usually temporary. While some beach condos also have limited space, the context of the sentence does not provide any indication that James is specifically living in a beach condo.
A bicycle is most likely to be safe in a garage because it is a secure and enclosed space where the bike can be protected from theft and weather damage. Sidewalks and streets are public areas where a bike can be easily stolen or damaged. Schoolyards may also be secure, but they are not always accessible to the general public. Toy stores are unlikely to have a safe space for a bike.
The sentence implies that children can learn about science in a fun way through a specific activity, and the term "experiment" is often associated with science education. Science experiments can be engaging and encourage curiosity and exploration, which may lead to excitement and enjoyment for children. The other options, such as "time," "frustration," and "become educated," do not directly relate to a fun way for children to learn about science.
The context of the sentence suggests that Sarah fell asleep while watching the movie. The sentence indicates that she missed the middle and that she closed her eyes in the beginning, indicating that she may have been tired or bored. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence and are inappropriate in this context.
Prolonged use of computers can cause strain and pain in the hands, wrists, and arms, leading to a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. This is caused by repetitive motions such as typing, and is a common issue in people who spend a lot of time using computers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the possible effects of computer use on the human body.
An enclosed shelf is more likely to be found in a cabinet than any of the other options. A cabinet is a piece of furniture that typically has one or more doors and shelves, and can be used for storage. It is common for cabinets to have enclosed shelves, as this helps to protect items from dust and other environmental factors. The other options do not necessarily have any connection to enclosed shelves.
Dark clouds are often associated with rain because they are an indication of a buildup of moisture in the atmosphere. As the clouds become heavier with moisture, they are more likely to release it in the form of rain. The other options, such as cloud vision or rain water, do not make as much sense in the context of the question. Weather might also be a correct answer in some contexts, but the specific phrasing of the question ("What are dark clouds likely to do?") suggests a more specific answer related to precipitation.
The sentence suggests that shallow water, regardless of being clean and chlorinated, would not be ideal for summer fun in a backyard. The word "shallow" implies that the body of water is not very deep and may be small, which rules out options like lakes and ponds. "Children's pools" and "swimming pools" may be too large or too expensive for a typical backyard. Therefore, the best option is "puddle," which is a small, shallow body of water that could occur naturally or from rainfall.
The question is asking about a privilege that is specific to being an adult. Of the choices given, only "marry" is a privilege that is typically only available to adults. Dressing oneself, drinking beer, working, and driving a train are not inherently privileges reserved solely for adults. While certain jobs may require a minimum age for employment, they are not privileges in the same way that the legal ability to marry is.
The question is asking for the location of a sofa outside of the person's own residence, which suggests that the sofa is likely to be located in another nearby dwelling. The most logical answer would be the neighbor's house, as it is a common place for a person to access furniture that is not in their own home. The other options are less likely because they are either too specific (person's living room, livingroom) or not related to the context of the question (White House, home).
The use of an "anger bar" suggests that the video game involves combat or some form of conflict. The purpose of charging up the anger bar is likely to increase the player's ability to engage in combat and defeat the enemy. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence or the concept of an anger bar in video games.
Falling from a height can definitely result in pain and broken bones, as the impact of the fall puts a significant amount of force on the body. Diving and going down do not necessarily suggest a fall from a height, and injuries could refer to a wide range of potential outcomes without specifying the likelihood of pain and/or broken bones.
The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the bright, populated city and a location with a smaller population. The options "suburbs", "town", and "countryside" are all areas that typically have a higher population density than the wilderness. "Outside" is too vague to be a clear answer. Therefore, the correct answer is "wilderness," which is an area typically defined by its lack of human populations and bright city lights.
The context of the question implies that the answer should pertain to a location where one can purchase apples. While apples can be obtained from a variety of sources, the options "table" and "fridge" do not make sense in this context. "Farmers market" may be a valid option, but the use of the word "typically" suggests that it is not as common as the option "grocery store". Finally, "apple tree" is not a plausible answer as it is a source of apples rather than a place to purchase them.
Comparison shopping refers to the practice of researching and comparing prices of products across different stores or online platforms before making a purchase. This method allows the buyer to find the best deal or price for the product they want. Bankruptcy and loss of money are not relevant to finding the best price, while overstocking and playing games do not describe a practical method for buying products.
ights were prominent during the Middle Ages, a time period known for its chivalry and codes of honor. Therefore, it is likely that a knight would be depicted as a hero in literature or events related to this time period. Castle may also be a possible answer, as many knights lived in castles and defended them from invaders. Renaissance festival and chess set have no clear connection to knights or heroism in this context, while historical novel is too vague to determine a specific answer.
Steel is a versatile building material that can be used for a variety of structures, from small buildings to skyscrapers and large industrial facilities like automobile factories. It is also a common material for bridges due to its strength and durability. Therefore, all of the options listed could potentially be constructed using steel. However, it's worth noting that the size of the house may be too small to warrant the use of steel.
Evening refers to the time period between sunset and bedtime, which means it starts after daytime has ended. Dawn is the time period before sunrise, early morning is the time period after sunrise but before midday, and night is the time period after evening and before sunrise. Sunset marks the end of the daytime, so evening cannot come before it.
The sentence suggests that stretching out the socks will change their fit. Stretching something typically results in it becoming larger or more spacious, so it is likely that the socks will have a looser fit after being stretched. The other options do not make sense in the context of sock stretching.
The sentence suggests that when meeting a friend over coffee, there is a common activity that is likely to occur. The best option that fits this context is "talk," as getting together with a friend over coffee is typically an opportunity to catch up and have a conversation. The other options, such as "excitement," "joy," "abuse," and "panic" do not have any clear connection to the context of meeting a friend over coffee.
The context suggests that there were multiple speakers present, which is a common occurrence at conferences. A drive-in movie, shelf, lecture hall or demonstration would not typically involve multiple speakers in the same way as a conference.
The sentence indicates that the child was unable to lift the box due to its weight, so the correct answer would be an option that refers to weight or density. "Toxic" and "isolated from sulphide pbs" do not provide any information about the weight of the box. "Light" is the opposite of what the sentence is describing. "Very dense" could be a possible answer, but since the sentence specifies that the child couldn't lift it, "very heavy" is a more precise option.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is buying tickets for a show or movie. The term "ticket booth" is commonly associated with movie theaters, where patrons pay for tickets to watch a film. The other options, such as sports arenas, auditoriums, operas, and metro stations, do not typically have ticket booths for events related to movies or shows.
The phrase "bringing suit" is often used in the legal context to refer to the act of suing someone in court. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to legal proceedings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
When fishing, the end of the fishing line is typically where a fish is hooked and caught. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of fishing.
Lizards are cold-blooded creatures, which means they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. By lying on a rock in the sun, they can absorb the warmth of the sun's rays and raise their body temperature to an optimal level. The other options may also be applicable to areas where lizards are commonly found, but they do not provide a direct explanation for why a lizard would lay on a rock in the sun.
The context of the sentence implies that if you poke yourself with a sharp knitting needle, you will start bleeding. Bleeding is a common response to puncture wounds caused by sharp objects, such as needles. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy needed to borrow a stepladder in order to reach the high shelf. The most logical place for Billy to find a stepladder would be in a store room where tools and equipment are kept. The other options, such as a tool shed, hardware store, construction worker's vehicle, or library, may also have stepladders, but they are not the most likely places for Billy to have found one in the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that ships have some benefit when there is no bridge available, which implies that they can be used to cross a body of water. The other options, such as colliding or bottoming out, do not make sense as benefits of ships. Carrying people and sailors may be related to ships, but those options do not directly answer the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that the location being described is specifically intended for young children who are just starting their education. Out of the given options, a preschool would be the most appropriate place for this. Playgrounds, big houses, buildings, and grandma's house do not necessarily have the same educational focus as a preschool.
Phonebooks are typically used to list phone numbers of individuals and businesses, making them the most likely source for finding someone's number written on paper. The other options, such as a math book, mathematics, office, or lottery, do not have any clear association with written phone numbers.
The word "paper" in this context likely refers to documents or files, and cabinets are commonly used to store and organize such items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that water rapids that are choppy are being described. The word "dangerous" would be a fitting description for rapids that are choppy, as choppy rapids can be more difficult to navigate and pose a greater risk to those who are trying to navigate them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "solidity" suggests that the building lacks a sense of substance or physical density. Since the opposite of solidity is hollowness, this means that the building is empty or has a lack of material inside. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of a building lacking solidity, as instability and weakness are related to structural integrity and openness is related to space or lack thereof.
The sentence suggests that the reason why humans invented sports may have something to do with an instinctual need or drive. The options "recreational, good looking, fun, and violent" do not seem to have any direct connection to this idea. However, the option "competitive" makes sense because sports are often organized around some form of competition or contest, whether it be between individuals or teams. Additionally, human beings are known to be competitive by nature, which may explain why sports have become such a prominent aspect of many cultures worldwide.
A map is a visual representation of an area or region, often including details such as roads, landmarks, and geographical features. It is commonly used to plan and navigate routes for travelling. An atlas is a collection of maps, and while it could be used for this purpose, it is not as practical for quick reference as a single map. The post office is not typically associated with travel planning or navigation. "Get to a specific place" and "phone" are not items that are used directly to figure out the best route for travelling.
When there is a source of light behind an object such as a tree, it is likely to cast a shadow in the opposite direction. This is because the object blocks some or all of the light, depending on its size and thickness. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question; for example, providing shelter or branch out are not related to the behavior of light and shadows.
The sentence suggests that the child used a utensil to scratch the plate, which most commonly would be a fork. While it is possible to scratch a plate with other utensils like a spoon or knife, using a fork is the most likely scenario based on the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context.
These are all common sources for accessing news and information on current events. Books typically offer historical perspectives and analysis rather than breaking news coverage.
The sentence suggests that the teacher's main job is to help students learn and commit to memory new skills. While memorization may be a part of the learning process, it is not the primary goal of the teacher. The other options are not directly related to the main job of a teacher in the classroom.
The sentence is too vague to provide any clear hints as to which answer would be correct. Depending on the context or topic under discussion, any of the options could be a valid and reasonable choice. Without additional information, it is impossible to discern which one is the intended or best answer.
Playing guitar involves creating music, which makes "making music" the most likely answer. While playing guitar may lead to singing or songwriting, these are not necessarily direct results of playing the instrument. Arthritis is a possible side effect of playing guitar, but it is not a typical outcome of playing. Listening to music might be a general interest of someone who is inclined to play the guitar, but it is not specific to the activity of playing itself.
The sentence implies that the houses are difficult to sell because of something that the former tenant did inside them. The use of the word "shoot" suggests that the activity was related to filming. The option "pornography" fits this criteria, as it is a commonly filmed activity that could make potential buyers uncomfortable with the property. The other options do not relate to an activity that would make a house difficult to sell.
The sentence suggests that there are only a limited number of options for places to stay in a particular location. This would be more likely to occur in a smaller town rather than a city, where there would be more lodging options available. Mexico and a holiday are not specific enough to provide a clear answer, while a phone book is irrelevant to the question.
The context of the sentence implies that the bone is found in a burial context, as it is wrapped in cloth. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "tomb," as it is the only option that pertains to a burial site. The other options, such as "museum" or "hospital," do not have any clear connection to the context of finding a bone wrapped in cloth.
Locking your knees while standing for an extended period of time can cause a decrease in blood flow to the brain, resulting in fainting. This is known as vasovagal syncope, a condition that can occur in people who tend to have low blood pressure or are dehydrated. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of standing in line or locking your knees.
Tidepools are shallow depressions in rock formations located near the shore that are filled with seawater. They are known for being habitats for small aquatic organisms, such as crabs, starfish, and anemones. This makes them a popular spot for beachcombing and exploring during low tide. The other options are less likely to have crabs, with the cooking pot being a tool for cooking them, beach sand being too exposed, the Chesapeake Bay being too large, and the fish market being a place to buy them rather than find them.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is attending a trade show, which typically includes booths and exhibits showcasing various products and services. In this context, a "demonstration" is the most likely activity a spectator would watch, as companies may showcase their products in action or explain their benefits through live presentations. The other options - sporting event, racing, show, and watch event - are not typically associated with trade shows.
The sentence implies that the party animals were drinking for a prolonged period of time, starting in the evening and ending at a later time. The only option that fits this time frame is "night," as it occurs after dusk and before dawn. The other options all refer to earlier times in the day and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is not used to getting up early, and as a result, has developed bloodshot eyes. Bloodshot eyes are a common symptom of sleep deprivation or tiredness, which may explain why the person needed drops to clear up their eyes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking specifically about where people store their plastic cutlery. While "store" could be interpreted as a possible answer, it is too generic and could apply to any type of storage. The other options, such as "everything" or "clothes closet," have no connection to the context of the question. "Cupboard" is the most likely answer as it is a common storage location for utensils and dishes in a kitchen setting.
The sentence implies that there is a specific gallery being discussed, and that it is likely focused on art since many features are on display. Art museums are commonly known to showcase a variety of different works of art, which could explain why many features are displayed there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "bringing people to the table" is often used metaphorically to refer to a person's ability to bring different parties together to negotiate or collaborate. In this context, it is unlikely that the person's success is based on their culinary skills or ability to acquire wealth. Therefore, the most likely answer is that they are skilled at making people feel valued and appreciated, which is often done through the use of compliments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a shopping bag, which is commonly provided at a place where you can shop for groceries and other goods. Supermarkets are known for providing customers with shopping bags to carry their purchases. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a location where you can play bowling. A bowling alley is a common place where people play this game, and a lane is a specific section of the alley where you throw the ball towards the pins. The other options, such as city, basketball court, rural countryside, or highway, are not relevant to the context of the sentence and have no connection to playing bowling.
Libraries are typically associated with quiet and peaceful environments, as people go there to read and study. Therefore, it is unlikely that excitement would be allowed in a library, as it could disturb other patrons. The other options are all associated with events or activities where excitement is expected or encouraged. For example, hockey games and boxing matches are known for their action and physicality, while car shows and dances provide opportunities for socializing and having fun.
The question states that female ants don't have wings, which limits how they can move around. This suggests that they must rely on other methods of locomotion, such as crawling. The other choices don't necessarily have a direct connection to the fact that female ants don't have wings, and therefore do not make sense in this context.
When going on vacation and taking a book, it would make most sense to store it in a suitcase, which is a common item used for packing personal belongings while traveling. The other options such as classroom, book store, and synagogue do not have any relation to the context of taking a book on vacation, while the briefcase is more commonly associated with carrying work-related documents and items rather than personal leisure items like books.
The sentence suggests that the cowboy was enjoying his experience "atop the bull," which implies that he was participating in a rodeo or similar event. The phrase "wild ride" is commonly associated with rodeos, where cowboys attempt to stay on bucking bulls for as long as possible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "ride" suggests that the answer must be related to an attraction or amusement, and the context of the sentence implies that the ride is intended to bring enjoyment or pleasure to visitors. The word "fun" best fits this description, as it is often associated with activities intended to be entertaining or enjoyable. The other options may also be desirable outcomes, but they do not fit as well with the specific context of the sentence.
The question is asking where on the upper body people want to remove hair, which suggests that the answer is a body part. The only option that is a body part is the arm, which is commonly shaved or waxed by both men and women. The other options, such as mammals, person's head, mammoth trunk, and sink, have no connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the animals were not thirsty, which implies that they did not need to drink water from the river. Instead, passing water (urination) could be a biological process that naturally occurs when animals are near water sources. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - feeling pain, flying, dying of cancer, and feeling pleasure are not actions that can be attributed to animals in this particular scenario.
The sentence implies that the parents are encouraging the children to play for a specific outcome. Given the context, it's likely that the desired outcome is related to the parents' enjoyment or relaxation (since they are not specified). Being entertained fits this the best, as playing is a common way for children to engage in fun activities that can be enjoyable for adults to watch or participate in. The other options (spending money, intermission, weight loss, sleepiness) do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the fear of A.I. is related to job displacement, which is a common concern associated with technological advancements. Fear of losing the ability to work is a common theme in discussions about A.I., as it is expected to replace many jobs that are currently performed by humans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cider is often made from apples, which are typically grown in orchards. Bees are known to be attracted to the sweet scent of apple cider, so it would be wise to be careful of them in an orchard where there may be beehives. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally hired people for a specific purpose, and that purpose was related to entertainment. The phrase "that was what she expected" suggests that the people she hired were doing what they were supposed to do. The only choice that makes sense in this context is "getting paid for," as it suggests that Sally expected the people she hired to provide entertainment as part of their job. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence explicitly states that John was a servant, meaning he likely did tasks or work for someone else. None of the other choices align with the description of a servant, as they imply a higher level of authority or freedom.
The sentence mentions that the person lived on the tenth storey of a walk-up, which suggests that they lived in a tall, multi-story building. The options "skyscraper," "tall building," and "apartment building" all fit this description, but "skyscraper" implies a more grandiose building than the others, and "tall building" is too generic. "Book of stories" and "mall" have nothing to do with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most likely answer is "apartment building."
The question refers to a common tradition in many parts of the world where confetti is thrown from rooftops during New Year's Eve celebrations. This tradition is often associated with big cities where crowds gather and party in the streets to welcome the new year. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The Queen knighted Dan, which is an act reserved for those who are considered worthy of honor and recognition. This suggests that the Queen believed Dan was deserving of this honor and did not think he was bad. The other options do not necessarily imply that someone is deserving of such an honor.
The presence of an attendant at the door suggests that this situation is taking place in a public space, like a theater, where it would be important to keep light out during a show. The other options (building, office, neighbor's house, funeral) don't fit the context of a premiere night for a show.
A clock is a tool used to keep track of time, so the answer choice that best relates to its purpose is "tell time." The other choices are not related to the function of a clock.
The sentence suggests that Sean was afraid of something happening to his door, specifically that it might open. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question specifically mentions "group projects," which implies that multiple people are working together towards a common goal. Working in teams is a common and effective way to approach group projects as it allows for individuals to draw on each other's strengths and collaborate to achieve the best outcome. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A welcome mat is typically placed in front of the entrance of a house to greet guests as they enter. Therefore, the correct answer would be "doorway." The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there are other consequences of sex besides procreation. Since the question is asking for what is even more common than kids, we can eliminate twins and children born as options. The mention of venereal disease and used condoms suggest potential negative consequences of sex, but they are not necessarily more common than pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy is the most logical answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that a group of people are waiting at a certain location before they are taken away, which is a common scenario at a bus stop. Bus stops are often used as a meeting point for people waiting to take public transportation, and they can be found in various locations such as urban areas or outside of city limits. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a mattress that is both soft and firm. Although "hard" and "harsh" are also opposites of "soft," they do not make sense in the context of a mattress as they would be uncomfortable to sleep on. "Loud" and "hexachord" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that Sam did not care about the company he kept on Christmas, suggesting that being alone was the primary concern. The options solitude and loneliness also suggest being alone, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence. The option he wants to marry is not relevant to the sentence and appears to be a non-sequitur. The option you is not relevant as it is not clear who "you" refers to in the sentence.
The question is asking about the requirement for buying something, which is spending money. The other options may be related to the act of buying, but they do not represent the actual requirement for purchasing something. Going shopping may mean browsing or looking at items, but it does not necessarily imply buying. Paying may be part of the process of buying, but it does not encompass the entire action. Having something in mind is a personal preference, but it does not necessarily mean that one will buy it. A shop is simply a place where one can buy things, but it does not represent the action of buying itself.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where multiple merchants can operate their stores together. In this context, a mall is a common term used for a large indoor shopping center that houses many stores under one roof. The other options may also have multiple stores, but they do not necessarily imply that these stores are in a shared space or under one roof.
Copy machines are commonly found in workplaces, such as offices, where people need to print and copy documents. The other options, such as barns, museums, assembly lines, and kitchens, do not typically require a copy machine, which makes them unlikely locations for one to be found.
When the body gets too warm, it activates its sweat glands to release sweat, which then evaporates on the skin to cool down the body. Sweating is the body's natural response to excess heat and helps regulate body temperature. Feeling guilty, sleeping, feeling more comfortable, and cuddling do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question asks about how kids can learn new things, which implies that the answer should involve a method of acquiring knowledge. Asking questions is a common way for children to learn new things, as they are naturally curious and seek answers to their inquiries. The other options do not have a clear connection to the task of learning new things, such as driving, which is not typically a skill that children can develop at a young age.
The phrase "steep learning curve" suggests that skateboarding may be difficult to learn at first, but once you master the basics, you can enjoy the activity and have fun. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that music is being played in a communal setting, which suggests that the correct answer must be a location where music is performed publicly. The options "elevator," "cassettes," and "store" are unlikely choices because they do not provide a public space for enjoying music. While music can be enjoyed at an opera, not all operas allow public access. A theatre, however, is a public venue where music performances are frequently held, making it the best choice for the answer.
The sentence mentions James wanting to add space for an extra guest, indicating that he already has a place to accommodate guests. The options hotel and guest room are already mentioned in the sentence are not relevant. The mention of buying a hide bed sofa suggests that James has limited space in his living quarters and opted for a multifunctional furniture item. Therefore, the most likely option is an apartment or a small house where space is limited. The option office does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the crab is feeling cold, which implies that it is in an environment with low temperatures. The only option that fits this description is the fridge freezer, which is a common household item used for storing food at low temperatures. The other options, such as the Gulf of Mexico, fish market, grocery store, and North Sea, do not have any clear connection to the idea of a cold environment.
The question is asking where someone can get sports equipment if they do not have any. Out of the given options, a sporting goods store is the most likely place to have a wide variety of sports equipment available for purchase or rent. Sears is a department store that may sell some sports equipment but not as specialized as a sporting goods store. A pool is a location and not a place to buy sports equipment. A sporting event is not typically a place to acquire equipment, and a school may have limited resources and may not have a variety of equipment available.
The phrase "everyone's goal" suggests that the answer is something universally desirable. The phrase "having sex long" may mean engaging in sexual activity for a prolonged period of time, but it could also be interpreted as wanting to have fulfilling sexual experiences over a long period of time. The options "sell beer," "herpes," and "cost money" have no clear connection with the context of the sentence, leaving "wonderful thing" and "last hour" as the possible answers. Based on the positive tone of the sentence, "wonderful thing" is the more likely option.
Hoboken is a city in the state of New Jersey, so the correct answer would be "new jersey". The other options listed do not have any connection to Hoboken or its location.
Driving on the left is a practice commonly associated with countries that were once part of the British Empire, such as Australia and India. England is a well-known example of a country where people drive on the left, including on motorways. The other options, such as Europe or a river, are too broad or unrelated to the context and do not provide any specific information to guide the answer. New Jersey and city are also incorrect choices as they are not countries but specific regions or places within the United States.
The word "centavo" is commonly used to refer to a subdivision of the Mexican peso, which is the currency of Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Silk is often associated with Chinese culture and is commonly sold in stores in Chinatown neighborhoods. Expensive clothing and garments may not necessarily be made of silk, and downtown is too broad a location to determine where silk might be sold. Nightgown is a type of clothing made from silk, but it does not provide any information on where it might be bought.
The sentence suggests that zoning rules prevented Sally from carrying out her plans to remodel her front garden. Zoning rules generally apply in urban areas, where there are regulations on how homes and properties may be used. None of the other options in the answer choices mention zoning rules or have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the setting is probably a location where fox hunting is common, but the weather is too dry for it to be a successful endeavor. New Hampshire has a history of fox hunting, but also experiences dry periods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the general store was located in a place where other shops were also present, indicating that it was part of a larger complex. This is most commonly associated with a shopping mall, where multiple stores are located in close proximity to each other for convenience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The reception desk is typically the first point of contact for guests when they arrive at a hotel. It functions as a central information point and is responsible for handling check-ins, reservations, and guest inquiries. Since the reception desk is a mainstay in the hospitality industry, it is typically positioned in the lobby of the hotel, where it can be easily accessed by arriving guests. The other options do not provide a suitable location for the reception desk.
The first sentence implies that Sarah has grown up and is no longer a child. The second sentence suggests that she had difficulty buying new clothes, which could mean that she outgrew her old clothes and needed to purchase larger sizes. "Large" is the most appropriate choice among the options given, as it directly relates to size. The other options do not provide any relevant information about Sarah's clothing size.
The sentence suggests that the plant did not do well in the shade, which implies that it requires more light to thrive. Direct sunlight is a term commonly used to describe an area that receives unobstructed sunlight, which would provide the plant with the necessary light it needs to grow. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Using a boat in an ocean requires significant navigation skills as it is a vast body of water with various factors that could affect the course, such as currents, wind direction, and waves. A river, on the other hand, may have a more straightforward flow, making it easier to navigate. Garage and boattail do not have any connection to water, while Indiana is a state and not a body of water.
The man needed a toothbrush and some food, which suggests that he was looking for a place that sells basic necessities like toiletries and groceries. The drug store and dentist office are more likely to sell dental hygiene products but may not have groceries. The mouth and attic are not places where one would buy toothbrushes and food. The grocery store is the most appropriate place for the man to have gone.
The sentence suggests that Janet enjoys dancing because it gives her a specific feeling. The words "swaying" and "music" imply that she is experiencing a pleasurable sensation while dancing. The word "euphoria" means a feeling of intense happiness or excitement, which fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence or would not be a desirable feeling to experience while dancing.
Supermarket boxes are primarily used for organization purposes. They are designed to hold and display various products on shelves or carts, and make it easier for customers to locate what they need. While some boxes may be used to store food items, the primary function is to keep the store shelves organized and tidy. Storage of clothes is not typically associated with supermarket boxes.
A chandelier is typically associated with larger and more formal spaces, such as grand buildings, ballrooms, or hotels. A foyer also suggests an entrance area to a larger structure, rather than a smaller one like an apartment or a spacious house. While a mansion could also be a possibility, the term "building" is the most general and inclusive option, encompassing all types of structures where a chandelier might be found.
The sentence suggests that James wants to keep his hot tub private and not share it with his neighbors. The phrase "turn his house into" implies that his fear is about his house becoming something undesirable due to the hot tub being public knowledge. Out of the choices given, "country club" makes the most sense as it is a type of exclusive club that has facilities such as pools and hot tubs that are only available to members. The other options, such as "health center" or "hospital," do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a winding mountain, which suggests that they were driving on a road. The phrase "pulled off to the shoulder" is usually associated with vehicles stopping on the side of a road. The other options, such as torso, garment, cello, and body, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where you can keep your plane ticket in your shirt, suggesting that there is a specific location on your shirt to store your ticket. The most common location for storing small items like tickets is in a pocket, which is why this is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question and are unlikely places to store a plane ticket.
The question suggests that the pictures being referred to have a story, which is a characteristic commonly associated with books. Books often contain visual images, such as illustrations or photographs, alongside a narrative or descriptive text to tell a story. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James used a blanket from his own personal belongings to cover the burn marks on the floor. The options "synagogue," "table," "carpet," and "general store" are unlikely sources for a blanket in this context, as they do not have any clear connection to James or his home.
The sentence suggests that Sarah made a poor decision and ended up experiencing negative consequences. Specifically, it suggests that she may have been caught using a fake ID while attempting to purchase beer, which would likely result in being arrested. The other options do not fit the context provided and do not match the tone of the sentence.
The word "chief" is commonly associated with a leadership position within a company or organization. The word "employee" suggests that the chief oversees the people who work for the company. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was caused by the man's mustache, which implies that it is a physical trait that is visually appealing to her. This suggests that the answer is related to attraction or desire, rather than more general positive emotions like joyfulness or enthusiasm. The use of the word "flirting" also supports the idea that there is a mutual attraction or interest between the two individuals.
When solving a math problem, it is important to check for errors or missing information in order to ensure that the solution is correct and complete. Checking for mistakes such as mathematical errors or calculation errors is important to ensure that the answer is accurate. Inappropriate and impolite are irrelevant choices, while books may be useful for reference but are not directly related to checking for correctness in a math problem.
The word "galactic objects" implies that the meteor is traveling in relation to something within a galaxy, rather than simply moving through empty space. An object that is orbiting is typically moving in a circular or elliptical path around a central object, which makes "orbit" the most logical choice. "Sky" is too general and doesn't specify a particular location or context, while "outerspace" and "universe" are too broad and could refer to any location beyond Earth's atmosphere. "In a vacuum" doesn't provide any information about the meteor's movement or location.
The sentence suggests that the story involves a character who undergoes a transformation from an older age to a very young age (a baby boy). The options "learn to speak," "adult," and "died" do not fit this idea. The word "old" is used twice in the sentence, indicating that age is a significant factor in the story, which rules out the option "baby boy" as the starting point. Therefore, the correct answer is "old man."
The sentence states that Bob was tossed from his boat in the Pacific Ocean near the United States and he sees a shore to the east. The only option on the list that is on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean near the United States is California. Florida is on the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean, and the other options are not specific enough or do not have a clear connection to the given context.
The sentence suggests that the discovery of truth brought some sort of release or resolution to something that had been troubling the person for a long time. "Relief" is a common feeling associated with the resolution of something that has been causing stress or anxiety. "Satisfaction" and "happiness" may also be possible, but they are not as strongly suggested by the context. "Hurt" does not make sense in this context, and "conclusion" is too general and does not capture the emotional aspect of the sentence.
Apple trees are typically grown in orchards, which are often found on farmland. Vineyards are more commonly associated with grape vines, and the south pole is a harsh environment that is not conducive to growing apple trees. While apples can potentially grow in parks, they are not typically found in abundance in those settings. An orchid is a type of flower, not a location for apple trees.
The sentence suggests that a new student is trying out a clarinet, which is something that commonly occurs in music stores. Music stores often have areas where people can try out instruments before purchasing them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence describes a presenter talking to an audience with the aid of a projector displaying slides on a wall, which is a common feature of a conference or business meeting. The other options, such as movies, theatre, or showing films, do not fit the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
The word "changed" suggests that the person underwent some sort of transformation. The phrase "demanded it" implies that there was some external force that caused the change. The option "unpleasant" seems to be the best answer because unpleasant experiences often lead to personal growth and change. Stagnation, tradition, paper money, and wife do not necessarily suggest an external force that would demand change.
The sentence suggests that the wind is coming from the east, so the correct answer should reflect the direction of the wind. "Easterly" is an adjective commonly used to describe winds that blow from the east. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a "powered leisure vessel," which refers to a type of boat that is propelled by an engine rather than wind or oars. The helm is the steering control of such a vessel, which is commonly found on motorboats. The other options, such as sailboats or tugboats, are not typically referred to as "powered leisure vessels" and would therefore not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that in order to begin reading, there is a necessary item that precedes the act of reading. The other options do not provide any tangible item that is required for reading. However, the option "concentration" appears twice among the choices - this is likely just a mistake, as it would not make sense for an option to be duplicated like this. Therefore, the correct answer is "written material," because without written material (such as a book or article), there can be no reading.
The question is asking what action to take when you receive something while at work. The given choices suggest different forms of communication, but only "email" is a communication method that typically requires a response. "Mute" is not an action that relates to communication and "fax" and "send" imply sending out information rather than receiving it. "Answer" is a possible option, but "email" is more specific to the context of receiving something while at work.
The sentence clearly refers to the end of the day, which is typically marked by the setting of the sun. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Deep dive" and "fall" are unrelated to the concept of time or the sun, while "lower" and "below" are vague and do not provide a clear indication of what happens at the end of the day.
Bees are commonly associated with flowers, as they play a vital role in pollination. Therefore, it makes sense that a bee would like a gift of flowers, such as a bouquet. The other options do not have any clear connection to bees or their preferences.
The sentence suggests that the phrase "considered good" refers to a person's reputation or perception among others. The phrase "contribution to society" is commonly associated with positive and impactful actions taken by individuals, which often contribute to a positive reputation. The other options, such as compliments or wearing outrageous clothing, do not necessarily contribute to a person's reputation as being "good."
The sentence suggests that a retired person may have to return to work if they require additional income. Retirement is usually associated with a period of reduced income when a person is no longer working, and so returning to work may be necessary to supplement their finances. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why a retired person would need to return to work.
Attics are typically found in older houses, especially those built before the mid-20th century. Victorian style houses are often among this group, as they were built during the 19th century. Basements and own homes are not relevant to the question, and specifically mentioning "victorian house" as a separate option implies that it may not necessarily have an attic.
The sentence suggests that the great general had been undefeated until this point but had just suffered his first defeat. This implies that his opponent was able to overcome him in some way, possibly through military conquest or other means of subjugation. Therefore, the correct answer is "conquer." The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence.
Madagascar is known for its unique biodiversity, including many species of lemurs and monkeys that are not found anywhere else in the world. Therefore, it is the most likely option for where you could find a monkey in the wild. The other options (friend's house, research laboratory, French government, beach) do not provide a suitable habitat for wild monkeys.
The Great Lakes are located in the northeastern region of the United States and are bordered by several states, including Michigan, which is known for its shoreline along Lake Michigan. Florida, Kansas City, Maine, and Georgia do not have any direct connection to the Great Lakes and are located in different regions of the country.
The sentence indicates that John bought a small butane stove that he can't use inside due to fumes. This suggests that he will need to use it in an outdoor setting. Options such as community kitchen, post office, and apartment do not have any clear connection to outdoor activities, leaving us with two options - friend's house or tent. Since John has bought a small butane stove, it is unlikely that he will need to cook for a large group and a tent may be a more logical option for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or picnics.
In the context of the sentence, the woman has returned home and needs to store her shirts. The most common place to store clothes in a home is a closet, which makes it the most likely choice for the correct answer. The other options, such as buttons, suitcase, washing machine, and sporting goods store, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah felt pessimistic about their chances, but Billy disagreed with her. The word "good" implies that he thought their odds were favorable or promising. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive view of their odds, except for "propitious" which also means favorable. However, "propitious" is a less common word and may be less likely to appear in this context.
The sentence indicates that the family members were gathered together for a special occasion, which is likely to be a family reunion. The fact that they were meeting their niece for the first time also supports this idea, as family reunions often involve members who have not seen each other in a long time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a gathering of family members.
The sentence implies that the listener has a specific purpose, which is to hear things. Empathy, thirst, knowledge, and learning do not necessarily require listening as their primary means of engagement. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "hear things".
The sentence suggests that the dental office handles patients who have experienced traumatic mouth injuries, which implies that these patients have been treated at a hospital before being referred to the dental office. The other options, such as town or office building, do not provide a clear reason for why patients would be experiencing traumatic mouth injuries. Schools may have sports injuries, but it is less likely that they would be referred to a dental office for treatment. Michigan is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the upright piano was used in a specific setting to improve the quality of the sound that was produced. A music room is a designated space for playing and practicing music, which implies that the piano was used in this context to enhance the sound quality. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location in question is not near a body of water where sharks are typically found, but implies that there are other hazards to be aware of. "Great outdoors" is a common phrase that refers to natural environments, which could include things like uneven terrain, wildlife, and extreme weather conditions. The other answer options either specifically reference bodies of saltwater or are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that pamphlets are being delivered to your home, which commonly happens through the mail. Mailboxes are a common place for mail to be delivered, including flyers or pamphlets. The other options, such as a drawer or the health department, do not make sense in the context of receiving pamphlets at home.
The sentence suggests that a clothing store can be found in a location where there are multiple merchants outdoors. This most closely matches the description of a strip mall, which is a collection of shops and stores in one area where customers can park their cars and walk around outside. The other options do not describe a location commonly associated with outdoor shopping and merchants.
The term "cubicle" is commonly used to describe a small, enclosed workspace for employees in an office setting. Corporations are often associated with large office buildings where employees work in cubicles. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "office building." The other options, such as "work" or "restroom," are not typically associated with cubicles.
The sentence suggests that people used to watch movies in their homes, which implies that the technology being referred to is older or outdated. The options "television" and "show" do not fit this description as they are still commonly used today. "Video store" is also less likely as it implies going out to rent a physical copy of a movie. This leaves "vcr" as the most likely option as it was a popular technology used in the past to watch movies at home.
The word "behind schedule" implies that the train is running late. Therefore, it is most likely to arrive late. While the train could slow down to ensure a safer journey, this would not necessarily make up for lost time. Arriving early or on time is unlikely if the train is already behind schedule.
The sentence suggests that the person is afraid of failure, which implies that they believe failing will result in them not achieving anything or being successful. "Amount to nothing" means that they will not accomplish anything worthwhile. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man learned shortcuts to become more efficient at his work, which likely involves the use of a computer. "Paste" is a commonly used shortcut on a computer, often used to copy and paste text or images. "Soft copy" refers to a digital copy of a document, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Unique" and "ocean" are not related to the topic of computer work or efficiency, and "creation" is too vague to clearly determine its connection to the sentence.
The context suggests that the word "office" refers to a place where work is done. The other options - school building, workplace, skyscraper, and public building - may also contain offices, but they are not exclusive to the function of working.
The sentence suggests that thinking hard and long can cause a physical reaction similar to that experienced during exercise. Like exercising on a treadmill, thinking can tire out the brain and lead to fatigue. The other options (depression, revelation, new thought, knowledge) do not logically follow from the information provided in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the act of laying eggs has a specific purpose for birds, and "reproduce" is the most logical choice as it is a well-known fact that birds reproduce by laying eggs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as birds do not typically pick berries or breathe differently when laying eggs.
The sentence implies that the person is being attacked, therefore they need to protect themselves from harm. "Defend yourself" is the only option that addresses this need. "Stay alive" is a general advice that may not be useful in the specific situation of being attacked. "Get rid of" and "fall down" are not applicable options in the context of an attack. "Attacked" is simply a repetition of the verb and does not offer any useful information or action.
The sentence implies that the ground floor of a certain location is available for overnight accommodation. This is typically associated with hotels, which offer guest rooms and amenities for travelers. Brownstones and highrise buildings may have apartments or offices on the ground floor, but these are not typically used as overnight accommodations for non-residents. Subways and office buildings are also not appropriate options for spending the night.
The sentence suggests that although the person in question is bad or disliked, their statements or words are still truthful. This implies that the person may have a reputation for being untrustworthy or deceitful, but their statements can still be relied upon for accuracy. The other choices do not have any connection to this context and can be eliminated.
Beach towels are specifically designed for use at the beach, so it is likely to find them there. The other options do not necessarily have any connection to the context of a beach towel. Backpacks are used for carrying personal items, while swimming pools and locker rooms typically have their own towels available for use. Hotel towels may be used at the beach if the hotel is located near a beach, but it is not the most likely place to find a beach towel.
The sentence suggests that the act of copulation (sexual intercourse) was happening, and someone used spit for a specific purpose. Spit is a natural lubricant and can be used to facilitate sexual intercourse. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Marking territory and releasing tension have no obvious connection to the act of copulation, while kissing and procreation are already implied by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that answering questions incorrectly will lead to negative consequences, such as embarrassment. This is a common experience for many people, especially in educational settings where the expectation is to answer questions correctly. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question, as they do not necessarily follow from getting a question wrong.
The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a professional setting where work is being done. An office building is a common location for a group of work spaces that may contain many computers since they are often essential tools for completing tasks. The other options do not provide a setting that would typically have a group of work spaces or computers.
Birds are known for laying eggs to reproduce, as they are oviparous animals. While some birds may sing songs or sleep together as part of their mating behavior, these actions are not directly related to the process of reproduction. Spreading wings is also not related to reproduction, as all birds have the ability to do so for various reasons such as regulation of body temperature or for flight.
A rubber stamp is typically used in a professional or personal setting for stamping documents or letters. Therefore, the most likely options for where to put a rubber stamp after using it are a desk or an office. Table and art class are less likely because they do not have a direct association with stamping documents or letters. Indiana is not a relevant option as it does not relate to the context of using a rubber stamp.
Potatoes are a root vegetable and need to be placed in soil in order to grow. Planting them underground provides the necessary nutrients and environment for the potato to sprout and develop. The other options are not suitable for growing potatoes as they do not provide the necessary conditions for growth.
The context of the sentence suggests that the union members were on strike and had demands or complaints that they wanted to address. The use of the term "settled" implies that an agreement was reached between the union and their employer, which likely satisfied their demands or addressed their complaints. As a result, the members would "go off strike" and "get back to work". The option "more money" may be a tempting choice, but it is not mentioned in the sentence and does not necessarily follow from the context.
The question asks for a mental requirement for beginning detailed work, which suggests that one needs to be able to focus their attention and concentrate. The other options do not relate to mental preparation, but rather physical actions or unrelated tasks.
The question specifies that the answer cannot involve water or buying something. Amusement parks fit this criteria as they offer rides and attractions that do not require water and admission usually covers all activities, so buying individual items is not necessary. The other options either involve water (swimming pool) or require purchasing items (airport, toy store) or both (Disneyland).
The sentence suggests that John couldn't take the ferret on the bus, so he had to find another mode of transportation. The only option that makes sense in this context is a taxi cab, which is a common mode of transportation for people who cannot take their pets on public transit. The other options are not related to transportation and do not make sense in this context.
The sentence implies that there is a prerequisite action that needs to be done before going to play with a friend. The correct answer is "meet" because before playing, you need to physically meet with your friend so that you can both go together to the place where you will be playing. The other options do not relate to this context.
Going on vacation on a deserted island suggests getting away from the hustle and bustle of daily life and finding some peace and quiet. This could mean seeking out relaxation through activities like sunbathing, swimming, or lounging on the beach. Alternatively, it could mean pursuing solitude and spending time alone with one's thoughts. The other options do not fit with the idea of a peaceful vacation on a deserted island.
The post office is a common place to send mail. It is a designated location for sending letters and packages, with specialized equipment and personnel to handle mail delivery. The other options, such as table, neighbor's house, railway station, and fridge, do not have any connection to sending mail.
issing is a common way for romantic partners to greet each other. This action is associated with intimacy and affection, which are elements that are typically present in romantic relationships. The other answer choices are not related to the context of dating and do not fit with the social norms and expectations of romantic interaction.
The question is asking for a country that is not part of the continent south of North America where you would not find a marmoset. The options "another place," "rainforest," and "foreign country" are too vague and do not provide enough information to determine if marmosets are found there. Venezuela is a country located in the continent south of North America and is known to have marmosets. Alabama is a state in the United States and is not part of the continent south of North America, making it the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the teacher has a planned activity that the students will not enjoy, and one possible activity that would fit this description is a time test. Time tests can be stressful and overwhelming for students, and many students do not enjoy taking them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Communion typically involves the consumption of wine or grape juice, which is usually stored in a glass or chalice. The glass on the wall is likely to be functional and capable of holding liquid, hence the correct answer is "hold water." The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of taking Communion in a church setting, as they do not serve a practical purpose.
The mention of the 8th and top floor suggests that Sally's office is located in a tall building, most likely a skyscraper. Skyscrapers are known for their tall height and multiple floors, which match the description given. The other options do not fit the criteria of having multiple floors as described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that something happens at the end of a sleighing ride that involves a couple. Since sleighing rides are often seen as romantic activities, it is likely that the couple engages in an act of affection, such as kissing, at the end of their ride. The other options are not associated with the context of the sentence, and therefore do not make sense as the answer.
Breathing is a vital process that allows living things to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, which is necessary for the body's cells to carry out various functions. Without oxygen, the body's organs and tissues would not receive the necessary nutrients and energy to survive. Asthma attacks are a respiratory disorder that can impact breathing but do not describe the purpose of breathing itself. Satisfying hunger and warming air are not directly related to the respiratory system or the function of breathing. Giving life is a broad and vague concept that does not specifically relate to the function of breathing.
The question is asking for the opposite of likening something to something else, which implies a comparison or similarity. Contrast is the most logical opposite as it suggests a difference or dissimilarity. Discern and distinguish are also related to identifying differences, but don't necessarily imply a comparison. Metaphor and discriminate are not opposites of likening, as metaphor is a literary device used to create comparisons, and discriminate has negative connotations related to prejudice and bias.
Organs are commonly associated with religious music, especially in Christian churches such as cathedrals. They are often played during church services and are a prominent feature of cathedral architecture. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The question talks about being supported by those closest to a person, which suggests that the answer is related to some kind of group or community. The term "support group" specifically refers to a group of people who come together to offer emotional or practical support to one another. The other options do not fit the description of being supported by a group or community.
The word "pantry" refers to a storage area for food items in a household, typically located in or near the kitchen. The sentence suggests that food is commonly stored on a specific surface within the pantry, and the most likely option is a shelf. A shelf is a flat surface that is able to support items and is commonly used for storage, particularly for food items that can be stacked on top of one another. The other options are less likely to be used for food storage in a pantry setting.
Murder refers to the intentional killing of one person by another, which means that the person who died did not want to die. The other options do not necessarily imply that the person did not want to die. Cyanide and suicide may indicate that the person took their own life, which could be seen as a form of wanting to die. Love and burial are not related to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the child knows where to find the cereal bowl and is confident that they can reach it. The most likely place for a bowl in a kitchen is a cupboard or cabinet, where dishes and other kitchen items are typically stored. The other options, such as a refrigerator or china shop, do not make sense in the context of looking for a cereal bowl.
The sentence suggests that James used tools to chop and shape wood, and that he kept adding to what he was building. This is a common process when building a house, where wood is used to construct the frame and walls, and additional layers of wood and other materials are added to create the finished structure. The other options, such as shelterbelt or bus stop, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
Both phones and computers are popular devices used for communication with friends who are not physically present. Smoke and printer do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and having friends is not a device used for communication.
When starting a business, one of the biggest challenges is securing enough money or funding to ensure that the business has enough resources to operate and succeed. While creativity and determination are important qualities for entrepreneurs, they do not guarantee success if the business is underfunded. Capital is also a relevant term, but funding is typically used more frequently when referring to startup businesses. Llamas do not have any connection to opening a business.
The question suggests that something is happening as a result of countries waging war. The options presented are all negative and suggest that something bad is occurring. The phrase "armies having to do" suggests that some action is being taken by the armies. The option "death and destruction" seems to fit the context of the question as it is a common result of war and may be an action taken by armies. The other options are not actions that armies would typically take during a war.
While football does have its risks, such as head injuries and concussions, the question specifically asks for a "good thing" about playing the sport. It is generally agreed upon that one of the positive aspects of football is the enjoyment and sense of fulfillment that comes from participating in a team sport, honing athletic skills and strategies, and working towards a common goal. The other options listed are all negative outcomes associated with football and therefore do not fit the criteria of a "good thing."
Apples are typically grown in cooler climates, so it is important to consider which countries in America have a northern location. Brazil is located in South America, so it is not a viable option. The word "fields" does not provide any clues, and "spring" and "outside" are not countries. Therefore, Canada is the logical choice as the northern-most country where an apple tree can grow.
The sentence suggests that forgiving someone can lead to a positive emotion, which is commonly associated with happiness. Forgiveness is often seen as a way to let go of negative feelings and move on from a difficult situation, which can lead to a sense of relief and contentment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam was talking to his friends about important things, which implies that he was seeking some kind of knowledge or information from them. The options "love," "happiness," and "money" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "communication" could be a possibility, but it is not as specific as "answers." Therefore, "answers" seems like the most appropriate choice.
The question is asking for a geographic location of Virginia, which is a state in the United States. Therefore, the correct answer is "united states." The other answer choices are either unrelated or incorrect, as Minnesota and the Virginias are separate states and "south" and "north" are not specific enough to indicate the location of Virginia within the United States.
The sentence specifically mentions that the gathering place is in the entrance hall, which is a location typically found in schools. Additionally, the mention of "teachers" suggests an educational setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Perjury is the act of intentionally lying or giving false statements under oath in a legal proceeding. It is considered a crime and can lead to criminal charges, also known as criminal prosecution. Going to jail may be a consequence of being found guilty of perjury, but it is not the name of the crime. Falsehoods and injustices are not specific legal terms, and mistrial refers to a situation where a legal trial has to be stopped and started again due to some error or misconduct.
"Cashing in" usually means exchanging something like a check or coupon for its cash value. In this context, it is most likely referring to receiving money in exchange for something else. The other options are not commonly associated with the phrase "cashing in."
Poker is a popular card game that involves players making bets based on the perceived value of their hand. The game is played for recreation or fun, but players can also lose money if they make poor decisions. The context of the question indicates that the person is actively engaged in an activity, which is most likely playing a game rather than simply relaxing or having fun. Therefore, the correct answer is game playing. The other options do not accurately reflect what someone would be doing while playing poker.
The sentence implies that the people saw a fox in the park and attempted to quickly take out their phones to capture a visual record of the encounter. The word "picture" is the only choice that directly relates to the act of taking a photograph, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the poet was trying to reach a specific audience of literary majors. It makes sense that he would go to a place where he could find those students, which would likely be a university. A classroom or study may have too limited an audience, while a bookstore or home wouldn't necessarily attract the right kind of reader.
The sentence suggests that the person was hiking for miles, which would likely cause physical strain on the body. The other answer options such as sweating or cramps may be symptoms of physical exertion, but they do not accurately capture the main cause of the person's discomfort. Smiling does not relate to the context of the sentence, and deliriousness may be a more severe symptom that is not necessarily implied by the sentence.
Refuse refers to trash or waste, and it is commonly stored in a dump for a long time until it is eventually disposed of or recycled. An incinerator is used to burn waste, a wastebasket or garbage can are small containers designed for temporary storage of waste in a house or business, and the options waste basket and garbage can are essentially the same thing. Therefore, the correct answer is dump.
The sentence suggests that the woman was working hard for herself, which implies that she was striving to achieve something. The phrase "accomplish goals" reflects this idea and is the most appropriate answer. The other options ("headache," "popularity," "take rest," "get laid") do not make sense in the context of the sentence or contradict the idea that the woman was working hard for herself.
The sentence suggests that gaining a lot of fat is not healthy, and the doctor's recommendation is likely to be related to reducing the amount of fat on the body. The term "lose weight" specifically refers to reducing body weight, which can be accomplished through a variety of methods like changes in diet or exercise. The other options do not convey the idea of actively reducing the amount of body fat. "loosing" and "loosing" are incorrect spellings of "losing." "Loss" is a noun and does not imply an action that the person should take. "Reduce" is a more general term and does not specifically address the issue of body fat.
In this context, writing down a passage suggests a personal activity, rather than a professional or religious one. Therefore, options like labyrinth, bible, and hotel do not fit. A diary and a journal are both personal writing formats that allow one to record their thoughts and experiences. The difference between the two is mostly in the frequency and purpose of writing, with a diary typically being more frequent and focused on daily occurrences, and a journal being more occasional and reflective.
The sentence suggests that there are musicians performing live and people are listening to them, which usually happens on a stage. A stage is a platform where performers can showcase their talents to an audience. The other options do not involve live performances, but rather places where one might find musicians or music-related items, such as a studio for recording music, a music store for purchasing instruments or recordings, a symphony or orchestra for classical music performances.
The sentence suggests that Billy and Dan have a long history together, which implies a level of trust and understanding. This is further emphasized by the fact that they were able to come to an agreement without needing a contract or compliance, which would suggest a more formal or business-like relationship. Harmony is also a possibility, but it is less specific to the context of the sentence. Death threats are clearly irrelevant and can be eliminated as a choice.
The sentence suggests that Danny was in a place where humans relax, and he stayed too long, causing him to potentially miss his flight. The options "bathroom," "airport," and "bed" do not fit the criteria of a place for relaxation. "Homes" is too broad and could refer to any part of a house, while "couch" specifically refers to a piece of furniture designed for sitting or lying down and relaxing.
The question describes a situation where something has been lifted and needs to be returned to its original position. The verb "lower" is the most appropriate choice as it means to move something down or to a lower position. The other options, such as "fall" and "below" may also suggest downward movement, but they do not convey the deliberate and controlled lowering of an object. "Sun set" and "place" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The phrase "grave injury" suggests that the person is seriously hurt and their condition is deteriorating, leading to the conclusion that they are dying. The option "victory" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it suggests a positive outcome, whereas the sentence clearly indicates a negative outcome. The option "casualties" refers to a group and not an individual and does not reflect the specific situation described in the sentence. The option "protect yourself" does not fit the sentence as it is not a possible outcome for someone with a grave injury. The option "death" is also a possible outcome, but it is not the one indicated in the sentence, as the person is still alive but in critical condition.
The sentence suggests that the teacher's pet enjoyed answering questions and was rewarded with something positive for each correct answer. The word "more" implies that the reward was increasing over time, which rules out the options of hate and confusion. Teaching and panic do not make sense in this context. Satisfaction is the most appropriate option as it is a positive feeling that can be easily associated with answering questions correctly.
The person's negative feelings towards the cold rain suggests that they would prefer a warmer, more pleasant type of weather. The option "sunny days" directly relates to this, as sunny weather is often associated with warmth and brightness. The other options, such as peace or compliments, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the person visited Switzerland, as the sentence mentions a famous mountain (which could be the Matterhorn or the Swiss Alps) and sampling chocolates, which Switzerland is known for. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A long, dark passageway is typically associated with a cave or subterranean environment, where the lack of natural light creates a dark and mysterious atmosphere. Such a passageway would not typically be found in a hotel, bathroom, airport, or house, as these environments are usually designed to be well-lit with artificial or natural light sources.
Libraries often keep archives of old magazines, making them a likely place to find old or outdated issues. Markets, doctors' offices, and tables are not typically associated with old magazines. The duplicate option of "library" reinforces the likelihood of this being the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that George did not like changes to his salary, which indicates that he preferred a stable or consistent supply of money. The other options, such as stagnant, constant, unpleasant, or permanent, do not accurately describe George's desired state for his salary.
Sending mail is typically done at a post office or a postal service center. The term "over the counter" refers to the act of physically handing your mail to a clerk or representative at a service counter. Candy stores, butcher shops, and kitchens are not places where mail is commonly sent or received, and "animals" is not a relevant or appropriate answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that James connected the new monitor to something that would allow him to use it to display images, indicating that it was likely connected to a computer or other device with display capabilities. The options "internet cafe" and "view bluescreen" do not make sense in this context, and "box" is not a viable option for connecting a monitor. Therefore, "desktop" is the most logical answer.
The sentence implies that the context is related to fishing, since it mentions cleaning a catch. The other options like table or kitchen drawer are not related to fishing, while pocket and board do not make sense in the context of cleaning a catch. Therefore, the correct answer must be fishing boat, which is the most logical vessel to use when cleaning a fish caught while fishing.
The context of the sentence suggests that the pioneer is in need of specific baking supplies, and one common baking ingredient is baking soda. Barrels, pepper, and salt are unlikely to be used in baking, and small town is not a type of baking supply.
The sentence suggests that the person worked extensively with a dictionary, which could indicate that they were writing a piece of literature that required a lot of research and attention to detail in their language use. The option "eat cake" is clearly not related to the context of the sentence, and the others could potentially be used for research in writing, but the use of a dictionary specifically points towards writing a novel as the best answer.
When a person falls, there is a high likelihood of getting injured, and broken bones are one of the most common injuries. Falling can cause a person's body to land on a hard surface, which can put a lot of pressure on one or more bones and cause them to break or fracture. While falling can also cause pain and injury without breaking bones, the specific wording of the question suggests that the answer is related to a specific type of injury, which is broken bones. The other options are either too general or do not accurately reflect the potential consequences of falling.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, commonly referred to as "the Met," is located in New York City. The sentence specifically mentions that Sean took a subway stop, which is a common mode of transportation in New York City. The other options do not have a well-known museum or attraction called "the Met" and do not have a clear association with subway systems.
The context of a "cookout with friends" suggests a social gathering where adults are likely to engage in leisure activities. While drinking beer and smoking cigarettes are possible activities, they are not necessarily the most common or defining aspects of a cookout. Dressing oneself is a basic everyday activity, and driving a vehicle may or may not be necessary for attending the cookout. Playing games, however, is a common and social activity at cookouts and aligns with the context of the question.
The sentence implies that George is in need of a place to stay, and the speaker offers to let him do so. The phrase "didn't have any place to go" indicates that George does not have a specific destination in mind, but needs a place to reside for the time being. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Boredom often prompts people to seek out entertainment or distractions. Of the given choices, "surf net" seems to be the most likely option for finding a variety of activities to alleviate boredom. Talking to a phone or seeing something new may not be effective ways to combat boredom. Playing cards or chess can be entertaining, but may not be readily available on a mobile phone.
The question suggests that planners are considering the location of Disneyland, and the answer choice "desert" is relevant because California has several desert regions. Disneyland may be located in a desert to take advantage of the sunny weather and generally dry climate, which can make it easier to maintain park facilities and provide visitors with enjoyable experiences. The other answer choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "shy" suggests that the person is uncomfortable or nervous in social situations, especially when meeting new people. Anxiety is a common feeling for shy individuals when they are faced with meeting new people. Stress may also be a possibility, but it is less likely to be the correct answer since the sentence specifically mentions being shy. Being bored and smiling are not related to the feeling of a shy person when meeting others, and making new friends is a potential outcome but not necessarily the immediate feeling.
The question is asking for a potential reaction when the speaker starts communicating with others. Among the choices, engagement seems to be the most appropriate because it suggests an active involvement and interest from the other party, which is the desired outcome of communication. The other options such as "people to think" and "distributed information" do not necessarily imply a reaction from the other party, while "exchanging ideas" and "sharing of knowledge" could be seen as an outcome rather than a reaction.
Turning up the thermostat typically means increasing the temperature setting, which results in the heating system producing more heat. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the temperature would increase. The options that suggest a decrease in temperature or dropping to zero are incorrect, as they are the opposite of what would happen when the thermostat is turned up.
The context suggests that Jane's concern is related to fire or burning something, and that the item she is worried about burning is located in her own home. The only option that fits this description is "house." The other options are unrelated to the sentence's context or do not match the details provided.
The sentence suggests that taking a shower in a particular location can be intimidating for shy kids in school. The most likely location for this scenario is a locker room, where students often change and shower in a shared space. The other options, such as a bath room, motel room, pool, or hotel, do not typically involve shared shower facilities and are therefore less likely to be intimidating for shy kids.
The sentence states that John would do anything, which suggests that he doesn't have any particular preference or care about what he does. The phrase "whatever" is often used to indicate a lack of preference or indifference, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not have a clear connection to the sentence's meaning.
The context suggests that the question is asking about where to acquire an action figure. The options "eat cake," "theater," and "bathtub" do not provide a plausible answer to this question, as they are not places where one would typically find or purchase an action figure. However, "little boy's toy box" may seem like a possible answer, but it is not a guaranteed source of an action figure, whereas a toy store explicitly sells toys, including action figures.
The sentence suggests that the person is studying anatomy and is aware of the main artery in the neck. Given that the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body through arteries, it is likely that the person is referring to the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. The other options, such as "busy city," "thruway," "hand," and "neck," do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Fungus can grow in damp and humid environments, such as basements. The other choices may not provide the necessary environment for fungus to grow on walls, except for maybe a shower stall or bathroom. However, those options may also include tile or other materials that do not provide the necessary conditions for fungus growth on walls.
The sentence suggests that John was unable to stand up from his current position at his desk, which indicates that he was likely sitting down. The other options, such as kneeling or lying down, do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a different posture altogether.
The word "drop" in the sentence suggests that the answer must be something small and contained, and "flood" suggests that it is something related to liquids. A test tube is a small container often used in lab settings to hold and manipulate small amounts of liquid, so it is the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a country whose heir to the throne is not the prince of it, which narrows down the options to actual countries. The term "prince" is commonly associated with monarchy and England is a well-known monarchy. The other options do not provide any clear indication of a monarchy or an heir to the throne.
The context of the sentence suggests that the child in question does not have a home. Therefore, it is likely that the child would go to a place that provides shelter, such as an orphanage. Schools and recreational areas are not typically designed to provide long-term housing, and "most homes" does not make sense in the context provided. "Pen" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not provide any clues to a potential solution for a homeless child.
The sentence suggests that the crabs are moving along the bottom of some type of body of water. The options "fish market" and "aquarium" do not fit the context of the sentence, as crabs in those locations would not typically be crawling along the bottom of anything. "Saltwater" is a possibility, but it is too broad and does not provide enough specificity. "Galapagos" is also too specific and does not fit the general context of the sentence, which suggests that the crabs could be in any body of water. Therefore, the correct answer is "bodies of water."
The sentence suggests that the person is eating a lot because they are trying to finish their food. This could be because they don't like wasting food or because they feel obligated to eat everything on their plate. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "wallflower" is often used to describe someone who is shy or socially awkward, and who may not feel comfortable dancing or mingling at a social event. This person might feel more comfortable standing against the wall, away from the crowds, hence the term "wallflower." The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence, or do not convey the same meaning as "wallflower."
The sentence suggests that the event being described is a common experience for people who drive cars. The phrase "seen or been in" also suggests that it is an action or event that is witnessed or experienced by the driver. Among the given choices, only automobile accidents match these criteria, as they are a common occurrence and can be experienced by both drivers and passengers. The other choices do not fit the given context.
The sentence describes someone who has an insatiable desire for more, suggesting that they are never satisfied. The word "plentitude" means a fullness or abundance of something, which fits with the idea of always wanting more. "Presence," "overabundance," "stockpile," and "Mormon" do not accurately express this idea.
The options that are related to household items or appliances such as grocery cart, kitchen, and fridge are not plausible choices as they do not sell fruit directly from growers. Supermarket could be a plausible answer, but it is a generic term that could refer to any type of grocery store. A fruit market, on the other hand, specifically suggests a place where fruits are sold, often directly by the growers themselves.
A dollar bill is a form of currency that is typically carried in a wallet or purse. These two options are the most likely choices as they are specifically designed to hold personal belongings, including money. A pocket may also be a viable option, but it is less secure and may be more prone to losing the dollar bill. The options "mailbox" and "buy coke" do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence implies that James walked for a specific purpose, rather than just for enjoyment or exercise. The phrase "moving forward" makes the most sense in this context, as it suggests that James was using walking as a means of transportation to get from one place to another. The other options (losing weight, blisters, meditation) do not fit as well with the context provided.
The sentence suggests that the person mentioned had a newfound appreciation for living in a free country, implying that they were once deprived of their freedom. The word "abroad" suggests that this experience may have happened in a foreign country, which narrows down the potential options. "Prisoner" is the most fitting option, as it directly relates to loss of freedom and imprisonment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people use something to carry things, which narrows the options down to "two hands" and "carry bags." However, the phrase "most people have" implies that the answer should be a natural part of the body rather than an external object. The other options, such as "two eyes," "ears," and "two arms" do not relate to carrying objects as directly as hands.
The sentence suggests that when nations agree with each other, a positive outcome will result. The context implies that this outcome is likely to be a desirable one, which rules out options like "problem." Additionally, the sentence suggests that the outcome will involve cooperation and harmony, which makes "peace" the most logical answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "keep my floor covering down" suggests that the speaker wants to secure a material to the floor. The only option that is a type of floor covering is carpet, so the tack should be put into the carpet to keep it down. The other options are either not related to floor coverings or are not capable of holding anything down. Additionally, the correct spelling of the option is "bulletin board."
The sentence suggests that lips are found on a particular part of the body, which is narrowed down to a specific category of body parts in the choices. The term "human face" is the most closely related option and is the correct answer. The other options, such as "body" or "knee," do not accurately reflect the location of lips on the human body.
The sentence suggests that Sam's efforts were unnecessary and did not accomplish anything, so any choice that indicates this would be correct. "Superfluous" means unnecessary or excessive, while "useless" means having no practical value or purpose. Both of these choices accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Swap cs" and "unneeded" do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not accurately reflect the idea that the efforts were unnecessary and accomplished nothing.
The question is asking for a place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine, which eliminates options like grocery store and drugstore. A mini mall and shop are too vague and could potentially sell a variety of products, so the most logical answer would be a pharmacy. Pharmacies typically sell personal care items like suntan lotion, but do not typically sell food or other non-medical products.
The sentence suggests that the person driving the car had a heart attack while traveling at a high speed. This is a dangerous situation that can result in a serious accident and potentially a fatality, which would make death the most appropriate answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the trait being referred to is genetically determined and located on top of one's head. Out of the choices given, only brown hair fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Condiments are typically used to enhance the flavor of food and are often placed within easy reach during meals. The kitchen and pantry are storage areas and not typically where condiments are kept while in use. The refrigerator is used to keep condiments fresh and safe to consume over a longer period of time, but they may not be easily accessible if they are chilled. A container could be used to hold condiments but is not specific to the context of the question, whereas the table is the most common location for placing condiments within reach during meals.
The most likely place for Sally to buy bubblegum is a supermarket or grocery store. These types of stores typically carry a wide variety of candy and gum, and it is common for customers to pick up a pack of gum during a shopping trip. The other options are less likely scenarios for buying gum: theater might have concessions, but not typically bubblegum, street and pocket suggest that Sally obtained it somehow surreptitiously, and church is not a place typically associated with selling bubblegum.
The question implies that the person who is getting divorced does not want it, which suggests that they may experience negative emotions as a result. The word "induce" also suggests that the divorce is causing or bringing about something in the person. "Freedom" and "joy" are unlikely choices because divorce is not typically associated with such positive emotions. "Depression" and "anguish" are more likely possibilities, as divorce involves the end of a relationship and can be a difficult and stressful process. "Tears" could also be a possibility, as crying is a common reaction to emotional pain.
The sentence implies that the person is enjoying the great outdoors, which suggests they are in a location where they would likely find a park. Parks often have trash cans available for visitors to dispose of their waste, making it the most likely choice among the options given. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person in question struggles to focus when reading, so instead they pretend to read. The fact that the sentence mentions falling asleep as an option suggests that the person is easily distracted and may struggle to stay awake while reading. The other options do not align with this idea and have no obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James' deli is located in a city with a significant history, which is often associated with New York City. Landmarks are typically located in major cities, and New York is well known for its historical landmarks. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the task was difficult but manageable, which suggests that it was bearable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: controvertible means open to dispute, interesting means engaging or stimulating, easy means not difficult, and agreeable means pleasant or enjoyable.
The options shed, atmosphere, photo, and outdoors are all natural settings where the sky is not considered to be fake. In a planetarium, however, the sky is artificially created using projectors and screens, which means that it is not the real sky seen outdoors. Therefore, the correct answer is planetarium.
The sentence suggests that the reason the players knelt to pray was related to their religiosity, as the action of praying is typically associated with religious practice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that the players were being watched, scared, or trying to communicate with a god who hears them.
The phrase "cargo" suggests that the answer is related to transportation or storage of goods. The option "at sea" is not specific enough and could refer to any location on the water. "Aeroplane" and "airplane" are modes of transportation that are not typically associated with cargo storage. "Boat" is a general term that does not specify a type of storage location. "Ship's hold" is a specific term used to describe the lower part of a ship where cargo is stored.
The sentence suggests that the visit to the museum evoked strong emotions in the old veteran, and he tried to hide it. Crying is a common physical manifestation of emotional distress, and therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have the same emotional connotation as crying and do not match the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the rooms in the experimental home had a feature that set them apart from traditional rooms. The use of the word "unique" suggests that this feature was unusual or unexpected. The option "square shape" makes the most sense in this context, as traditional rooms are typically square or rectangular in shape. The other options ("possessions in," "high walls," "doors and windows," and "triangles") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "fair" suggests that a process or system is being assessed for its impartiality and justice. In civil law, a trial is a judicial proceeding in which evidence is presented, witnesses are called, and a decision is made by a judge or jury based on the facts of the case. A trial is considered a fair and impartial way to reach a decision because both sides have an opportunity to present their case, and the decision is based on the evidence presented. The other options do not relate to the idea of assessing fairness in a civil action.
The sentence suggests that people who do the same kind of work gather in a particular location. The workplace is the obvious choice since it's where people would go every day to do their job. A convention could also be a possibility, but it's not a daily occurrence and would depend on the specific industry. The other options, such as a train station, wedding, and theater, don't seem to have any clear connection to people gathering based on their profession.
Eating dinner typically results in the feeling of being full, as the body begins to digest the food. Heartburn and indigestion may occur if the food is not properly digested, but these symptoms are not always present after eating dinner. Becoming tired may also happen after eating, but it is not a universal occurrence and thus isn't a reliable answer. Flatulence can happen, but it is not a commonly experienced effect of eating dinner.
Running aground means that a ship has hit the seabed, reef or any other underwater obstacle, causing it to stop moving forward. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Near shore" or "sail on sea" do not necessarily mean a ship will stop moving. "A Romulian space craft" is a reference to Star Trek and is not a realistic scenario. "Heading east" does not provide any relevant information about why a ship would stop moving.
"Run out of steam" is a common idiomatic expression that means to become exhausted or to lose energy. This expression is often associated with trains because steam locomotives require a constant supply of steam to operate, and if the steam supply runs out, the train will stop moving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of trains or exhaustion.
Hospitals are commonly associated with beds because they are used to provide a comfortable resting place for patients. Rest areas may have some beds, but not as many as hospitals. Bedford is a place name, not related to beds. The neighbor's house and loft may have beds, but it is unlikely there would be a lot of them.
The question specifies that it is referring to the mid-western U.S., which rules out options like Manhattan and New York City, which are located on the East Coast. The reference to skyscrapers suggests that the answer is likely to be a large city with a significant number of high-rise buildings, which narrows the options down to Chicago and other major cities in the region. However, the fact that Chicago is known for its tall buildings, such as the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower), makes it the most likely correct answer.
The question implies that there may be negative consequences associated with having a medical checkup. Anxiety is a common emotional response to medical appointments, as people may be worried about their health or the possibility of receiving bad news. Pain is a possibility, but not necessarily a common outcome of a checkup, and good behavior and uncertainty do not make sense in this context. Stress is a possibility, but anxiety is a more specific and commonly associated emotion with medical checkups.
The sentence suggests that the prize being competed for is prestigious, which implies that it is highly regarded and respected. The fact that the prize has no money suggests that it is not a financial award, but rather a recognition of achievement or excellence. The word "competing" also implies that the individual is seeking to attain something of value, which points towards accomplishment as the correct answer. The other options, such as enemies, rivalry, or bad blood, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with a prestigious prize.
The word "stored" suggests that the flour was kept in a designated place for safekeeping. The options "grocery store" and "table" are unlikely because they suggest a public space or a communal area, whereas the sentence implies that the flour was being kept in a private household. The options "cupboard" and "kitchen" are possible but not as specific as "pantry," which is a dedicated storage space for food in many homes.
The sentence suggests that the teacher is explaining a type of screen that uses a cathode ray tube, which is a type of vacuum tube commonly used in older technology. However, the sentence also specifies that this screen is used to measure things, which suggests that it is an oscilloscope, which is a device used to graphically display and analyze electronic signals. The other options, such as television and computer, do not typically use an oscilloscope for their display.
The question implies that there is a consequence for not signing a contract. Typically, if a contract is not signed, it is considered incomplete and therefore invalid. That means it can be rejected, as it lacks the necessary signature(s) to make it legally enforceable. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb" is slang and unrelated, "written on paper" is obvious and not a consequence, "signed" is the opposite of what is being discussed, and "revised" implies that the contract has already been changed or edited, which is not mentioned in the question.
The combination of cord, nails, and bolts suggests that this is a location where hardware or DIY supplies are sold. The delivery room, sporting goods store, and office do not typically stock these items, so they can be eliminated. The garage could be a possibility, but it is not a specific enough answer - many different types of items could be stored in a garage. Therefore, the best choice is the hardware store, as this is where one would expect to find all three of these items together.
Elevation sickness is a condition caused by exposure to high altitudes, which can cause a number of symptoms including headache, fatigue, and confusion. The word "wits" in the sentence refers to the climber's mental faculties, which may be affected by elevation sickness. The word "diminishment" means a reduction or decrease in something, which accurately describes the climber's situation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the meaning of the word "wits."
The sentence mentions flashing lights causing something bad to happen to James. One possible explanation for this is that James experienced a seizure, which can be triggered by flashing lights for some people who have epilepsy. The other options do not have any clear connection to seizures or flashing lights.
The sentence suggests that printing too much money can lead to inflation. Therefore, printing "not very much" money would be the appropriate action to take to combat inflation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Shopping involves purchasing goods or services, which requires a form of payment. Money is the most commonly used method of payment, which is why it is necessary for someone to have money in order to shop. The other options, such as sleeping or bringing flowers, are not related to the act of shopping. "Get money" could be a possible answer, but it is less specific than "have money" and doesn't clarify from where the money should come.
The sentence suggests that the act of greeting with a kiss is a way to do something simple. This likely refers to a simple way to show affection or greeting, which is a common custom in many cultures. The other options (manipulate, companion, separate, electrical circuit) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the dog was barking loudly, but James was not scared because it was confined. The most likely place for a dog to be confined would be a backyard since it allows the dog some room to move around while still being enclosed. The other options - kitchen cupboard, front door, table, and park - do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable place for a dog to be confined.
The context suggests that the magician was able to make a guess about the identity of something or someone based on his skills. The choices "hierarchy" and "court" are less likely to be linked to such a guess. Additionally, the term "game" is used twice in the sentence, suggesting that the answer may be related to a game. The options "chess game" and "chess set" are related to chess, but the magician may not necessarily have been good at chess. Thus, the most appropriate option would be "deck of cards" as this is a game commonly associated with magicians and guessing games.
The sentence suggests that the blinking light is located on the driver's side of the car, which is typically where the turn signal is located. The options "slow down," "go forward," and "get to town" do not make sense as they do not involve the use of a turn signal. The remaining options, "turn left" and "turn right," both involve the use of a turn signal, but the position of the blinking light on the driver's side suggests that the driver intends to turn left.
The context of the question implies that the person is interested in houses, which suggests that their end goal is to become a homeowner and own a property. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context and do not align with the goal of purchasing a home.
The sentence mentions that the dairy cow farm provided milk for a big chocolate company, which suggests that the company is located in Switzerland. Switzerland is known for its chocolate production, so it is likely that the company mentioned in the sentence is based there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the dairy or chocolate industries.
The sentence mentions "choreographed moves on the field," which suggests a performance that involves movement. Additionally, the fact that the person is playing the saxophone suggests that they are part of a musical group or ensemble. The options "music store" and "store sells instruments" do not relate to a performance, while "actors" and "orchestra" do not involve movement on a field.
The sentence explicitly states that John enjoyed the sensations of being in the bath, which suggests that he found the experience pleasurable. The other options do not necessarily imply pleasure or enjoyment, and some may even contradict the idea of relaxation, such as invigorating or deep breathing.
The sentence suggests that bald eagles can be found along the Mississippi River in a specific state. Wisconsin is a state that touches the Mississippi River, so it is a likely choice. Iowa and Canada also have portions of the river running through them, but the sentence specifically asks for a state. Currency and New Mexico have no connection to the Mississippi River or bald eagles.
The sentence suggests that James wants to socialize more as he feels he lacks a certain aspect. The context of the sentence implies that James is looking for social interaction and connection with other people, which is often associated with building friendships. The other options such as free time, entertainment, and input do not specifically relate to the need for socializing or building connections with others. "Meet people" may be a contender, but it does not suggest the desired outcome of building relationships.
The Carpathian Mountains are located in Romania, which eliminates the other answer choices. The sentence also suggests that the country is located furthest in the direction of the side that won the U.S. Civil War, which can be interpreted as being in Europe, since the war was not fought there. Romania is the only answer choice that is in Europe, and it was a part of the Allies, who were the side that won the war.
The Roman Empire had a stratified class system with distinct privileges and rights assigned to certain groups. People who were not born into noble families were referred to as plebeians, while those of noble birth were referred to as patricians. The other options, such as inferior and ignoble, do not carry the same connotation and are not specific to the context of the Roman Empire.
A motionless horse is most likely to be found in a stationary setting, such as a farmyard or stable, rather than in a racing or wild environment. The other options, such as Washington (a state or city) or a painting, do not suggest a location where a motionless horse might realistically be found.
The sentence mentions that the farmer was looking for an apple tree cultivar that is hardy in the western United States. Out of the given choices, only Idaho is located in the western region of the United States. The other options are located in the northeastern and southern regions of the country, which suggests they may not be suitable for planting the apple tree cultivar that the farmer is looking for.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person in question is at a restaurant, which is typically a place where one goes to eat. The other options, such as self esteem, compliments, easy life, and fulfillment, are not things that one typically seeks out at a restaurant. Delicious food, on the other hand, is a common reason for going to a restaurant and is therefore the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the teenagers were engaging in reckless behavior, and while some of the other choices may also suggest inappropriate behavior, drinking is specifically mentioned as the activity they were engaging in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the mom enjoyed helping her children, which is often associated with feeling loved and appreciated. Parents are typically motivated to help their children because they love and care for them, not because of any legal obligation or financial gain. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the mom liked giving assistance to her children.
The question is asking about something that a bird may have in a tree. A nest is a structure that birds build in trees to lay their eggs and raise their young. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or to anything commonly associated with birds in trees.
The context of the sentence suggests that the dental office is located in close proximity to a candy store and fast food location, which is a common occurrence in strip malls. Strip malls are typically small shopping centers that are located along busy streets or highways and usually have a mix of retail stores, restaurants, and service providers like dental offices. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the area in question is known for its steakhouses, which narrows down the options to only a few. Maine, Florida, and Michigan don't have a particularly strong association with steakhouses, while Arizona is a large state with a variety of culinary traditions. Kansas City, however, is known for its barbecue and steak, which makes it the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the Earth goes through a cycle of changes over a period of time, which is a characteristic commonly associated with the four seasons. Seasons are a natural occurrence that happen every year and are caused by the Earth's tilt and its orbit around the sun. The other options are not related to the Earth's seasonal changes.
The question implies that there may be a reason for someone to stay in a relationship with a man. Of the provided choices, acknowledgment is the most likely reason. Acknowledgment could mean that the person wants to feel appreciated or recognized by their partner. The other options do not provide a clear reason why someone would stay in a relationship with a man.
Starting a family traditionally involves getting married, as marriage is often seen as a commitment to building a life together and supporting one another in raising children. While having sex and getting pregnant may be part of starting a family, they do not necessarily require a committed partnership like marriage. Spending money and being stressed are not directly related to the process of starting a family.
The use of the word "spilled out" implies that the plastic monkeys were contained in something, likely a container with an opening at the top. A barrel is a common type of container with an open top that could hold many toys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the opposite of being ridiculous is being straightforward. Ridiculousness implies a sense of absurdity or foolishness, which is the opposite of being straightforward, which implies being direct and honest. The other options may be associated with different emotions, but they do not have a clear connection to the topic of ridiculousness.
Bald eagles are known to live in areas with access to bodies of water, as they primarily feed on fish. Rural areas can offer ample access to both water and undisturbed natural habitats, making them a more likely location to spot a wild bald eagle. The other options, such as painting, zoo, and aviary, do not offer live views of a bald eagle in a natural setting. While it is possible to see bald eagles in Colorado, the question does not provide any specific location or context, so it would be safer to choose the general answer of "rural area."
The sentence mentions that the drawing room was one of fifty rooms, which suggests that it was located in a large house rather than a smaller residence such as a kid's house or a studio. The options "house in England" and "mansion" could both potentially refer to a large house, but there is no clear context or information in the sentence to suggest that the location was specifically in England or that it was a grand and luxurious mansion.
The sentence suggests that the beauty is caused by the reflection of sunshine, which is often associated with bodies of water. When the sun's rays reflect off the water, they create a sparkling effect that can be visually stunning. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not typically involve sunlight reflections or visual beauty.
The sentence suggests that the person is thirsty and has an empty glass. It is logical to assume that the person wants to fill the glass with water or some kind of beverage. The most common place to put a glass when you want to fill it is on a table. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence: a refrigerator is the appliance that is used to keep food and drinks cold, a dishwasher is used for washing dishes, a water cooler is a device that dispenses cold water, and a dining room is a room where people eat meals.
The sentence suggests that there wasn't enough space for Samantha to join the game, which implies that someone else was already playing. Therefore, for Samantha to join, someone else had to leave in order to free up space. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that John is watching his calorie intake, which means he likely wants to reduce his overall consumption of calories. Since the drink was very sweet, it probably contained a lot of sugar or other sweeteners that can contribute significantly to one's daily caloric intake. In order to offset this, John may want to consume less food overall to keep his calorie count in check. The other options, such as throwing up or stumbling, do not logically connect to the context of the sentence.
Graphite is commonly used as the core material in pencils, which are traditionally made with a wooden barrel and an eraser at the end. However, despite its name, "lead" is not actually used in pencils anymore due to its toxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "lead pencil" since it reflects the common usage of graphite in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for an assumption about people who get up early. One common reason for getting up early is to start the day early, which may require going to bed early to ensure enough sleep. Therefore, we can assume that people who get up early often go to bed early. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context and cannot be assumed with certainty.
A sword is a type of weapon or tool that is typically displayed in museums or collections. A container called a scabbard or a sheath is used to hold a sword, but it is not where someone would go to see one on display. A school is also an unlikely location to see a sword. Therefore, the correct answer is museum.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys listening to music and is particular about the quality of sound. The term "audiophile" refers to someone who is passionate about high-quality sound reproduction. The phrase "replaced the stylus almost as often as he switched albums" suggests that the person is using a device such as a record player, which requires a stylus to play vinyl records. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Lizards are cold-blooded animals that require warmth to regulate their body temperature. The tropics are known for being warm and humid, which can provide an ideal environment for lizards that need warmth. The other options do not offer a clear indication of a warm environment that would appeal to a lizard. A garden, for example, could be cool or damp, while a forest may offer shade and shelter but not necessarily the warmth that a lizard needs to thrive.
The sentence suggests that the picture was easy to see, and this clarity could be attributed to a recent cleaning. When pictures or surfaces are dirty or murky, they tend to be less clear and more difficult to see. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks what everyone tries their whole life to be. This suggests that the answer is a universal goal or desire. We can eliminate options like "sad" and "cat" because they are not something people actively strive for. "Grow old" is a natural process that happens to everyone, but not necessarily something they try to achieve. "Believed" does not make sense in this context. This leaves us with "happy," which is a common goal for people, suggesting that it is the correct answer.
The word "preceded" suggests that the act of meditation comes before meeting people, indicating that it is done to prepare for the social interaction. The context suggests that this preparation is due to a negative feeling or state, and the option "anxiety" is commonly linked to social anxiety, which can lead someone to feel overwhelmed by social interactions. The other options, such as "love" or "making new friends," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "silly" suggests that Billy found something about the turtle's movements to be ridiculous, which is a synonym for silly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the question is related to governmental proceedings. The word "argue" suggests a debate or discussion, which is typically associated with the legislative process in a country. The other options, such as mail box, post office, restaurant, and trash, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or to the topic of government proceedings.
Freezers are typically found in homes and sometimes in garages. They are also sold in appliance stores for consumers to purchase. However, it is unlikely that an office building would have a freezer as it is not a necessary appliance for typical office work. Similarly, a flat may or may not have a freezer depending on the owner's preference and needs.
The sentence suggests that the lady needs to buy a lot of items and has limited time, so she needs to go to a place where she can find many things in one location. Supermarkets are known for offering a wide variety of items, including groceries, household goods, and personal care products, all in one place, making them a convenient option for someone with limited time. The other options do not fit the criteria of offering a wide variety of items in one location.
The question is asking where to obtain a freezer, which implies that the person currently does not have one. The options "icy cold," "own home," and "garage" do not make sense as places to obtain a freezer. "Freeze food" is also incorrect because it describes an action (freezing food) rather than a location or source. The correct answer is "appliance store" because they sell refrigerators and freezers.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person doing housework is being exposed to a lot of dust. Inhaling dust can lead to a condition called dust poisoning, which can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the question pertains to a situation when someone is away from home and sleeping in a different location. Among the choices, hotels are likely to have fire safety measures in place and have fire exits on the first and second floors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that everyone crowded around the toilet during a break in an event, which suggests that the toilet is located in a place where many people gather. The options "restaurant," "stadium," and "mall" all have public restrooms and could potentially fit the context. However, the option "space shuttle" is unlikely since it is not a common place for people to take breaks, and there are typically only a few toilets on board. Therefore, the best answer is "bathroom."
The sentence suggests that the purpose of chatting with friends that you admire is to achieve a sense of closeness. This may be because feeling close to someone is often a desirable outcome of social interactions, especially with people that you admire and respect. Exchanging information and smiles, while important parts of conversation, may not necessarily be the main goal of chatting with someone you admire. Love and social approval are also not necessary or guaranteed outcomes of social interactions.
The sentence suggests that Danny had to seek food from someone else, which implies that there was another household nearby. The most likely place for him to have gone would be to a neighbor's house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest any external source of food.
The sentence mentions chemicals and chemical burns, which suggests that the location where Sally and Joe were burned was likely a place where chemicals are used or stored. Options such as swimming pool and beach are unlikely to have chemicals that cause burns. Crystal meth lab is a possible location, but it is less likely given the specific mention of a chemistry lab. Laboratory is a broad term, but it is the most general option that could apply to different types of chemical labs.
The word "conquer" suggests a complete victory over the opponent, making "total domination" the most fitting option. The other options may indicate success but do not necessarily convey the same sense of complete control over the opponent.
The word "observe" in the sentence suggests that the friends are looking at something together, and the phrase "at the same time" suggests that they are seeing the same thing. The phrase "see like" implies that they are seeing in a similar way, as in having a similar perception or interpretation of what they are observing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John didn't enjoy eating the hamburger and that it had a negative effect on him. The word "nausea" means feeling queasy, which is a common side effect of eating something that doesn't agree with you. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
Rest areas are places on highways or roads where drivers can stop to rest or use the restroom. They often have parking spaces and amenities such as vending machines, picnic tables, and restrooms. Therefore, a group of travellers who are travelling by road are likely to stop at a rest area for a break. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they are related to other modes of transportation such as train stations and airports.
The sentence mentions that Steve used his diaphragm, which is a muscle located in the human body. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Castles are known for their large wooden doors, which were often reinforced with iron or other sturdy materials to protect against invaders. While some homes may have large wooden doors, it is less common than in castles. Airports and skyscrapers typically have automatic sliding doors or revolving doors made of glass or metal, and not wooden doors. "Every building" is too broad of a category and cannot be inferred from the question.
The question suggests that the animals mentioned are in a setting where they can enjoy a drink, which is most likely a bar environment. The other options do not make sense in this context. The African continent is a large area and does not provide any specific setting for the animals mentioned. The Amazon basin is a rainforest and not a place where animals would go to enjoy a drink. A research laboratory or friend's house would not typically have monkeys, elephants, or zebras.
The description of John seeing an insect using its legs and Mary seeing insects using their wings both suggest that the insects were in motion, which might lead the reader to consider "move" or "fly" as possible answers. However, the mention of wings specifically points more strongly to "fly" as the correct answer. "Buzz" and "sense vibrations" don't seem to fit with the context of the sentence, and while insects certainly eat, that doesn't seem to be what's being described here.
Getting up early requires going to bed early as well so that the body can have enough rest and energy for the day ahead. Fixing an alarm can only remind a person to wake up, but it does not guarantee that they will have the energy to start their day. "Go sleep early" is not a grammatically correct option, and "dawn" is not a practical solution as it is not an action that a person can take. Asking a spouse to wake a person up can put unnecessary pressure on the spouse and may not be reliable. Therefore, the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early is to go to bed early.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is attending a lecture or presentation, specifically one about advanced theoretical physics. Therefore, the most likely location for needing a pencil would be in a classroom or lecture hall. The other options, such as desk drawer or home, do not fit the context since the person is not likely to have those locations accessible during a lecture. Pocket could be a reasonable option, but it is less likely since the sentence mentions the need for a pencil specifically, which may not always be carried in a pocket.
The sentence suggests that expressing oneself through art, music, and other hobbies can be enjoyable, which is commonly associated with "fun". The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as "fight", "communication", "understood", and "suffering" do not necessarily apply to expressing oneself through hobbies.
Parks are often known for having different types of birds due to the availability of food sources, such as bird feeders, and the presence of trees and bushes for shelter. Forests may also have a variety of birds, but the context of the question suggests a more urban setting, making park the most likely option. Stores and air have no clear connection to the context, whereas countryside may have birds, but the question suggests a specific location.
The sentence implies that the living conditions in the building were not great, but it also suggests that the building did meet minimum standards for habitation. The word "barely" indicates that the building met only the most basic requirements for safety and functionality. The word "adequate" means sufficient for a given purpose or need, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options either contradict the context of the sentence or are irrelevant.
The sentence implies that toll roads are not situated near the Pacific Ocean on a specific coast. The options that mention the Eastern United States or Good Repair are too broad or vague to provide a clear answer. Delaware and Connecticut are the only two options that specifically mention a coastal state that is not on the Pacific Ocean, so one of those two states is likely the correct answer.
This question is asking about the proper location to put tin after purchasing it. Tin is a useful material that is often used in construction and household repairs, so it is likely to be found in hardware stores. The other choices don't make sense in the context of the question. An antique store would not sell new tin, and it would not be useful to put tin in a shopping bag or landfill. A shed could be a possibility if it is being stored for future use, but a hardware store is the most appropriate location after purchase.
The items listed in the question are commonly found in a department store, which typically sells a wide variety of products under one roof. A backpack, house, and table are not typically sold together in the same location, and a mall usually has individual stores rather than a singular department store.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a place to buy toys for their kids to play with. Disneyland and the jungle are not typically associated with buying toys, while a swimming pool is a place to swim rather than buy toys. Home is also an unlikely option as the sentence implies that the speaker wants to take their kids somewhere to buy toys. A toy store is therefore the correct answer as it is the most logical choice for buying toys.
The phrase "a man's best friend" is commonly used to refer to dogs, who are known for their loyalty and companionship to humans. The characteristic that differentiates dogs from the other options in the choices is that they have four legs, which is a defining characteristic of dogs and many other animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Based on the context of the sentence, the person climbing the mountain is likely to experience a rush of excitement or adrenaline due to the physical activity and exposure to fresh air. Exhilaration means feeling a sense of excitement or thrill, which fits with the situation described in the sentence. The other options may also be associated with climbing a mountain, but do not capture the specific feeling of excitement and energy that is implied.
The word "unsuccessful" suggests that the writing program did not achieve its intended purpose, which is likely to cause frustration for the user. Bugs and unexpected results are possible consequences of an unsuccessful program, but they do not necessarily relate directly to the user's experience of frustration. Satisfaction and aggravation are unlikely outcomes of a program that did not work as intended.
The term "pit" commonly refers to the area in front of a stage where the orchestra is situated. It is where musicians play music for plays, operas, and musicals that require live instrumental accompaniment. Flutes are commonly used in orchestras, which makes it likely that they can be found in a pit. The other answer choices do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when someone is called stupid, it may mean they have a lack of intelligence or mental capacity. The term "no brains" is often used as a derogatory expression to mean someone lacks intellect or common sense. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the ficus is a plant that can potentially dirty carpets, which makes it an indoor plant. Among the options, only "apartment" is a type of location where it would make sense to have an indoor plant. The other options do not offer any clear clue as to where the ficus would be placed inside a building.
The sentence suggests that the person felt alone despite being in a class with other people. The word "even" implies that there are many people around her, but she still felt isolated. Therefore, the correct answer is "surrounded," as it suggests that there are people around her, but she still feels alone. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the action of making a hole with one's fist is associated with a solid surface that can be punched through. Swiss cheese and golf courses do not have solid surfaces that someone could make a hole in with their fist. A football ground or plain ground could potentially have a solid surface, but it is not specifically mentioned in the sentence. A wall, however, is a solid surface that someone could make a hole in with their fist.
Red clay tennis courts are typically found in country clubs, as they are expensive to maintain and require a great deal of care. Wimbledon is known for its grass court, while New York hosts the US Open on hard courts, and town and health clubs may have a variety of surfaces, but red clay is not commonly found outside of country clubs.
The sentence suggests that the person is already standing or walking, and their legs are tired. Sleeping or going to bed are not appropriate options as they are not practical in the moment. Running would only make the situation worse. Closing eyes is not mentioned in the context of the sentence and cannot be assumed to be a solution to tired legs. Sitting down is the most appropriate option as it will allow the person to rest their legs and take a break from standing or walking.
The sentence implies that playing tennis all day results in a physical activity that causes exhaustion. Tennis is a sport that involves a lot of movement and exertion, so it is likely that most people would feel tired after playing for an extended period. The other options do not address the physical toll that playing tennis all day would have on a person's body.
The question is asking for a common location where TVs are used to display sports. All of the answer choices are common locations where people watch sports on TV. A restaurant may have a TV in the bar or dining area, a living room or apartment may have a TV for personal use, and a bar may have multiple TVs for patrons to watch different games. While "house" is a general term, it is still a common location where TVs are used to display sports.
The sentence suggests that the animals understood the importance of fluids, which implies that they knew when to drink and how to avoid potentially harmful substances. The other options (feel pain, bite, fly, gay) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person who stayed over after having sex with the man woke up in his house the next morning. The man got up early to do something, which suggests that it was morning and he was starting his day. The most logical thing for someone to do in the morning is to eat breakfast, so it can be inferred that the man made breakfast for the person who spent the night. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The fact that the king was assassinated in the middle of his speech suggests that the day was not actually auspicious as he had claimed. The word "ominous" is often used to describe events that are foreboding or foreshadowing something negative or dangerous, so it is the most appropriate option. The other choices do not accurately reflect the situation and therefore do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a common act of consumption that people engage in while having food, which indicates that the answer should be related to food or beverages. Of the choices given, drinking is the only one that fits this description. The other options are either unrelated or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question implies that someone experiencing stress may do something to excess, and the options given suggest possible behaviors. While cleaning or dreaming excessively might be possible, the use of drugs or alcohol is a common coping mechanism for people experiencing stress. The specific mention of "drink alcohol" in the options reinforces this answer as the likely choice.
After a potato is done growing, it needs to be stored in a cool, dark, and humid place to prevent it from sprouting or rotting. A root cellar is a traditional storage area in many homes and farms that provides these ideal conditions for potato storage. The other options, such as "own kitchen," "clam chowder," "desk drawer," and "kitchen cabinet," do not provide the necessary conditions for potato storage and are therefore not the correct answer.
The other options do not have any clear connection with gaining new perspectives. However, traveling to a new place offers the opportunity to experience different cultures, environments, and ways of thinking that can broaden one's worldview and provide new insights and perspectives. This makes "travel abroad" the correct answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that the family members are crying, which is a common expression of strong emotion such as sadness, grief, and anguish. The context of the sentence involves murder, which is a violent and traumatic experience that can cause great emotional pain and suffering. The other options, except for "terrible," which is a vague adjective that does not clearly indicate an emotion or feeling, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Remorse" refers to a feeling of guilt or regret, "retaliation" refers to taking revenge or seeking justice, and "wet" is a physical sensation that does not relate to the emotional state of the family members.
Seats are commonly used in cinemas to watch movies. While movies could arguably be a correct answer, it is less specific and could refer to watching at home, whereas cinema specifically refers to a place where movies are shown to an audience in a theater-like setting. Hockey games, theaters, and operas also have seating arrangements for audiences but they are not typically associated with watching movies.
The term "omnidisciplinarian" suggests that John is knowledgeable and skilled in multiple fields or disciplines. Therefore, he may be able to adapt and find success in various situations that require expertise in different areas. The other options, such as ocean or awards ceremony, do not have any direct correlation with John's abilities as an omnidisciplinarian.
The sentence describes a situation in which a door is closed, which implies that the action required to go through the door is to open it. The other options do not provide a feasible solution for going through a closed door. "Keep people out" suggests preventing others from entering, "enclose cupboard" suggests placing something inside a confined space, "teleport" is a fictional concept that is not possible in reality, and "glass" is a material used for windows and barriers but does not relate to going through a door.
The sentence mentions that the child is looking at pictures of animals and hearing rhymes from his mom, suggesting that they are likely at a place where there are many different animals to see. The word "favorite" also indicates that the child is choosing from a selection of options, further suggesting that they are at a zoo with a variety of animal exhibits. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Wet cleaning a floor requires a tool that can absorb water and clean up dirt and grime, such as a mop. A fan and energy are not cleaning tools, and vacuuming is typically used for dry cleaning of floors. A broom is also not suitable for wet cleaning as it will just spread the water and dirt around.
The word "beautiful" suggests that the lightning strikes are not viewed as dangerous or destructive. Rainy days are often associated with thunderstorms and lightning, making it the most likely choice. November and average days do not have any specific weather associations or characteristics that suggest beautiful lightning strikes, making them unlikely options. Dull and wet are both negative adjectives and do not fit with the positive connotation of "beautiful."
The sentence suggests that drinking alcohol can have a negative impact on a specific activity or function. The word "lose" further implies that this activity or function may be impaired or hindered by alcohol. Since the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of alcohol, we can eliminate them. The remaining option, "sleep at night," is a common problem associated with alcohol consumption and is often cited as a reason to limit or avoid drinking.
Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks displays as a way to celebrate the national holiday. Groundhogs and construction sites are not typically associated with Independence Day, and landmines and army may have negative connotations that do not relate to the celebratory nature of the holiday.
In many hotel rooms, clothes storage is provided in a closet, which is a built-in or standalone structure that features a hanging rod and/or shelves. A drawer, which is a compartment that slides in and out of a piece of furniture, is more likely to contain smaller items such as socks and undergarments, but may also hold shirts. Garderobe is a less common term that refers to a room or space for storing or hanging clothing, but is not typically used in hotel contexts. A shelf can be used for storage, but isn't typically a primary option for clothing in hotel rooms. A suitcase is generally used for transporting clothing, rather than storing it in a hotel room.
The question is asking about a strategy to ensure that one is remembering something, which suggests that the other options are unlikely to be effective. Closing one's eyes and answering a question are not necessarily related to memory, while "bad time" and "forgetting" are not strategies at all. "Stopping to think" is a common technique for recalling information, as it allows one to focus their attention and retrieve relevant details from their memory.
Bars are commonly associated with serving alcoholic beverages, while vending machines, bottles, refrigerators, and hockey games do not necessarily have any connection to alcohol consumption. While some venues, like hockey games, may offer beer for sale, they are not solely focused on serving alcohol in the same way that bars are.
The sentence suggests that the person has killed people in a state of anger or fury, which commonly leads to feelings of guilt or regret after the violent act is committed. Remorse, which means deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed, is the most appropriate choice among the options considering the context of the sentence. Stomach ache and retaliation do not make logical sense in this context, while sadness is not a strong enough emotion to describe the severity of the situation. Going to jail is a consequence of the action and not a feeling.
The question suggests that someone or something may be using too much salt, and the options given each represent a possible culprit. A shaker or kitchen cupboard may be used by individuals who have control over the amount of salt they add to their food, making it unlikely that they would use too much. "People" is too broad and does not provide specific information. A table is an inanimate object and cannot use salt. A fast food restaurant, however, is known for using high amounts of salt in their food to enhance flavor and preserve freshness, making it the most likely answer.
The question suggests that the friendly man did something specific to show that he was happy when meeting new people. Out of the given choices, the act of smiling is most commonly associated with expressing happiness and friendliness when meeting someone new. While saying hello, starting a conversation, and shaking hands are all common social interactions, they do not necessarily indicate happiness on their own. Introducing oneself is also a common social norm, but it does not necessarily suggest a person's level of happiness.
The sun sets in the west, which is a well-known fact based on the direction of the earth's rotation and the position of the sun in relation to the horizon. The other options, such as outer space and beans, are irrelevant and do not provide any helpful information.
The context suggests that the question is related to injuries sustained in a skiing accident, and broken bones are a common injury in such accidents. Frost bite and chapped lips are possible consequences of prolonged exposure to cold weather, but they may not necessarily be present in multiple places. A healthy body is not an injury, and broken legs are not necessarily present in more than one place.
The sentence suggests that despite John's efforts to care for Kate, she repeatedly put herself in danger. The word that fits best in the blank should convey a lack of concern for her own safety, which is indicated by the fact that she kept putting herself in harm's way. The options "neglect" and "apathetic" also convey a lack of care, but "disregard" is a better fit in the context of the sentence. The options "unfeeling" and "indifferent" do not necessarily imply a lack of concern for safety, and so are not the best choices.
The sentence suggests that the agent of change has a negative feeling towards the king and is planning to do something to him. "Disposed" means to get rid of something or someone, which fits the context of the sentence indicating that the agent of change is planning to get rid of the king. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "achieve learning as an adult" implies that the poet is seeking higher education or advanced learning opportunities. While it's possible to learn outside of a university setting, the other options given (classroom, English class, book store, and home) do not necessarily suggest a formal, structured environment suited for adult learners. Additionally, universities are well-known for offering a variety of programs and courses that can accommodate different interests and goals.
itchen towels are commonly used in the kitchen for a variety of purposes such as drying dishes and wiping countertops. Therefore, it is more likely that it would be found in a location that is easily accessible from the kitchen, such as a cupboard or a drawer. The other options, such as hotel, linen closet, under a rock, or locker room, do not have any direct relevance to the context of the question.
The use of "sir" or "ma'am" after answering a question is a common sign of respect and formality, suggesting that the speaker is being courteous and well-mannered. The other options (irritation, correct, responding, sadness) do not align with this type of behavior and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Matt had difficulty controlling his anger, which implies that he may have had a physical reaction when someone triggered him. Punching someone is a common physical response when someone is angry and feels out of control. The other options do not align with this context - destroying an enemy, writing letters, and illustrating points are all more strategic or intellectual responses rather than physical ones. Cooling off is a more neutral option, but it doesn't necessarily suggest any action or behavior on Matt's part.
The sentence suggests that when two people are doing the same thing, they tend to compete. Competing is a common behavior when two people are competing for the same thing or working towards the same goal. The other options, such as helping or giving orders, do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy enjoyed going to the party because he liked to mix and have a good time. The other options, such as planning or meeting new people, are not mentioned in the context of the sentence and do not seem to be related to Billy's enjoyment of the party. Getting drunk is a possibility, but it is not the only way to have fun at a party, and the sentence does not specifically mention drinking as the reason for Billy's enjoyment. The watusi is a type of dance and is not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the couple entered their "prom," which is a school dance typically held indoors. The options "movie theaters," "end of line," "football field," and "opera house" are all outdoor venues or places that do not typically host school dances. "Auditorium" is the most fitting option as it is commonly used as a venue for school events such as dances, concerts, and theater performances.
The phrase "wanted no trouble" suggests that the person wants to avoid confrontation and conflict, so the best course of action would be to keep walking and not engage with the bully. Choosing to step up or be courageous could escalate the situation and put the person at risk of physical or verbal harm. Crossing the street may be a good option if it allows the person to avoid the situation altogether, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Doing nothing is not a desirable option, but it may be the safest choice for someone who wants to avoid trouble.
The sentence suggests that the hipsters took a disingenuous and kooky approach to their cafe, which implies that they were trying to be different or unique in a forced or insincere way. This approach may have alienated potential customers or made it difficult for them to understand what the cafe was all about. The sentence also suggests that the competitor took a different approach that allowed them to succeed, and since the other choices all suggest some form of alignment with the hipster approach, the correct answer is conventional, which suggests a more straightforward and traditional approach that is more likely to appeal to a wider range of customers.
The question is asking for the best place to store a ballpoint pen, which implies that it is a long-term storage location rather than a temporary one. The other answer choices don't seem like logical locations for long-term storage of a pen. A pocket could lead to loss or damage, a stationery store is where one would buy the pen, a backpack is a transportation method, and a bank has no clear connection to pen storage. Therefore, a desk drawer, where one would store office supplies, seems to be the most appropriate choice.
The sentence suggests that cutting in line at the ticket office is unacceptable and may result in a punishment. The phrase "end of line" is often used as a warning to those who try to cut in line and suggests that they will be sent to the back. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that success is achieved through preparation and some other factor, which is likely to be related to putting in effort or hard work. Working hard is a commonly recognized factor in success, and is also a general term that can apply to any field or situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are not commonly recognized as factors in success.
Air conditioning is commonly used in professional spaces like office buildings to maintain a comfortable temperature for workers. It is also commonly used in residential homes like houses, especially in areas with warm climates where temperatures can become uncomfortable. The other options, such as Texas and humid, do not necessarily suggest that an air conditioner would be present.
The question is asking for the opposite of the key to happiness while living life. The sentence suggests that simply existing is not enough to achieve happiness, implying that one must do more than just exist. The other options (happiness, early death, acquiring knowledge, being idle) do not provide a clear opposite to the key to happiness.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to purchase something before they can cook dinner. This implies that they do not have the ingredients they need, so they must go out and buy them. The option "buy a kitchen" is unlikely, as it does not make sense to buy a new kitchen in order to cook dinner. The option "hungry" is incorrect, as it is unlikely that someone would need to be hungry to cook dinner. The options "buy food" and "eat food" are also incorrect, as they suggest that the person already has food but must either purchase or consume it.
The sentence implies that ending a marriage can have both negative and positive consequences, and in this case, the positive consequence is suggested to be relief. Relief can be a common feeling after a difficult and unhappy marriage ends. The other options, such as grief, confusion, depression, and happiness, may also be associated with ending a marriage, but they do not align with the specific idea of relief that is suggested in this sentence.
The sentence suggests that James enjoys hearing Jenny do something and that they often spend time together and get home late, which implies that they may be doing activities that involve some form of entertainment or leisure. "Tell story" or "jump rope" do not fit the context of the sentence, and "clean room" seems unlikely to be an activity that James enjoys hearing. "Going out at night" is also unlikely since the sentence states that they already spend a lot of time together. Therefore, "sing" is the most logical choice as it is an activity that can be entertaining and enjoyable and does not conflict with the information provided in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that after getting money from a bank, the next location would be one where household items and food can be purchased. A grocery store is the most likely option as it offers a wide variety of food and household essentials. The other options (city, financial center, main street, salon) do not necessarily have anything to do with purchasing household items and food.
The sentence suggests that being free from guilt can have a positive effect on a person's well-being. Guilt can create feelings of anxiety and unrest, which may impact a person's ability to sleep peacefully. Therefore, it is likely that if someone is free from guilt, they are more likely to achieve peaceful sleep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Danny has not fully experienced what it means to be human, which suggests that he may be missing an emotional or interpersonal element. The option "love" fits this description, as it is a fundamental human emotion that is often seen as a defining characteristic of the human experience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a term that describes when two people have the same point of view. "Agree with each other" is the only option that directly reflects this meaning. "Make love" and "when they hug" are unrelated to having the same point of view, while "shake hands" and "work together" may indicate a level of cooperation, but not necessarily a shared perspective.
The sentence suggests a negative outcome that could happen after only a short amount of time hiking. Cramps are a common affliction that can occur due to strenuous physical activity, so they would be a likely answer in this context. Adventure and smiling suggest positive outcomes, which do not fit the negative tone of the sentence. Sweating is a natural occurrence during exercise and wouldn't necessarily be a negative outcome. Giving up would be an extreme answer that doesn't fit the context unless more information is provided.
The question suggests that people are waiting for a ride across town, which is most commonly associated with public transportation. A bus stop is a specific location where people gather to catch a bus, taxi or other forms of public transportation. The other options, such as a wedding, convention, pool or apartment, do not have any clear connection to people waiting for transportation across town.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person wants to make money by selling houses, which is a key area of focus within the field of real estate. Studying real estate will provide the person with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the market, understand property values, and negotiate deals. The other options listed are not directly related to the real estate industry and would not provide the necessary knowledge to sell houses.
The sentence suggests that the woman had a compulsive habit of washing her hands excessively, which would likely lead to skin irritation. Repeated washing can strip the skin of its natural oils and cause redness, itching, or even cracking. The other options do not seem like likely consequences of this behavior.
Priests are commonly associated with performing religious rituals or ceremonies, such as saying mass or baptising individuals. The context of the sentence suggests that the priest is in front of a gathering of people, which may indicate that he is performing a public ceremony. The other options, such as drinking coffee or being on trial, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the activity must involve sound but not require movement of the mouth while driving to work. Anger and speed are not activities that involve sound, while singing requires movement of the mouth. A statue is a stationary object and not an activity. Therefore, the correct answer is listening to the radio, as it involves hearing sounds but does not require movement of the mouth.
A marmoset is a type of primate that is native to the rainforests of South America. They are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time in trees, and are known for their agile and acrobatic movements. Therefore, the best answer would be rainforest as it aligns with the natural habitat of marmosets. The other options - kitchen, wilderness, dictionary, and burrow - do not fit with the expected environment for a marmoset.
A monarchy is a form of government where a king or queen serves as the head of state. The term "kingdom" suggests a country or territory that is ruled by a monarch, making monarchy the most closely associated form of government. "Ruled by government" is too broad and could apply to various forms of government, while "Europe" is a continent and not a form of government. "Book" is not related to the question at all.
The sentence suggests that Manny did not show respect to the court, which would be considered disrespectful and disobedient behavior. The term "contempt" specifically refers to actions that show disrespect or disregard for the authority of a court or similar institution. The other options, such as dishonor or humiliate, do not accurately reflect the legal consequences of disrespecting a court.
The mention of a storm suggests that the question is about a region that is prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes or cyclones. The options "summer" and "weather report" do not refer to a specific geographical region. "Blue shield" is the name of a health insurance company and is therefore not relevant to the question. "America" is too broad and does not describe a specific storm-prone area. This leaves "tropics" as the most logical choice, as this region is known for experiencing frequent and intense tropical storms. Additionally, the Red Cross is known for its humanitarian efforts in response to natural disasters in tropical regions.
The context of the sentence suggests that the man was convicted of a crime related to his lack of motivation or effort, which may imply that he may have been employed in a job that requires him to be active and productive, such as a civil servant. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the people were actively trying to make themselves comfortable by sitting down, which implies the use of some type of seating. The option "legs" is incorrect because it is not something that is required for sitting down comfortably. "Laziness" is not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Floor" is incorrect because it is not necessarily comfortable to sit on the floor. "Sit on" is also incorrect because it is not a specific object or item that can provide comfort.
The sentence suggests that the dog has a lot of energy and enjoys chasing after a ball repeatedly. The phrase "over and over" implies that the dog does this for a long period of time, suggesting that eventually, it will become tired. The other options, such as "ball stopped" and "fall and hurt yourself," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Breathing" is a natural process and doesn't have any clear connection to the dog's activity, while "catching" is already implied in the first part of the sentence (i.e. the dog loves to run after the ball).
Parks are commonly associated with relaxation and leisure activities, such as picnics, walks, and spending time in nature. In contrast, workplaces, war zones, and jails are typically associated with stress, danger, and confinement, which are not conducive to relaxation. While churches may promote a sense of peace and calmness, they are primarily intended for religious worship and may not necessarily be a place for relaxation.
The word "standing" suggests that the people are not sitting, lying down, or moving around, but rather they are stationary in one location. This makes it unlikely that a supermarket or street corner would contain many people standing inside, as these are places where people are typically walking or moving around. "Public place" is too broad of a term to determine if it would contain standing people, and "space shuttle" is an unlikely option as it is a small and confined space. A school, on the other hand, often has large groups of students standing in classrooms or other common areas, making it the most probable option.
The sentence suggests that large amounts of water can cause significant changes over an extended period of time. Mountains are known to be shaped by the erosive forces of water, which is why the option "move mountains" is the most appropriate choice. The other options, such as "room temperature" or "thin blood," do not fit with the context or the scientific knowledge of the effects of water over time.
The question implies that going to a party with the opposite sex can have certain consequences, and the choices suggest different possibilities. Out of those options, having sex is most commonly associated with parties where alcohol is consumed and people are in close proximity to each other. While it is possible to meet new people, drink beer, and enjoy oneself at a party, those options do not necessarily lead to the same consequences as going to a party with the opposite sex.
The sentence suggests that children are going somewhere to see different animals. The most common place to see a variety of animals in one location is at a zoo. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. School is where children go to learn, soccer and cricket stadiums are for playing sports, and Disneyland is a theme park focused on entertainment, not animals.
The context suggests that the focus is on the emotions and feelings experienced while giving assistance. Death and trouble are negative emotions and do not fit in this context. Happiness is a positive emotion, but it may not always be the case when giving assistance. Pleasure and feeling good are more general terms that can encompass a range of positive feelings, such as a sense of fulfillment, satisfaction, or altruism.
The description of multiple farmhouses close together suggests that this place is likely a farming community, where agriculture and farming are central to the local economy and way of life. The other options do not fit the description of the setting provided.
The name "Zeus" is commonly associated with Greek mythology, which is populated by a pantheon of gods and goddesses. The sentence suggests that Zeus was a member of this group of deities, as opposed to being a boy, female or lady. The term "feminist" does not apply to mythological figures in this way, and is therefore an unlikely choice for the correct answer.
The question asks for a reason to stop chatting with friends, and one of the options is misunderstanding. This suggests that there may have been a disagreement or miscommunication that caused discomfort or tension in the conversation. Learning about, meeting, laughter, and silliness do not necessarily involve a negative experience that would cause someone to stop chatting with friends.
The sentence suggests that one of the friends always won when they played cards. This implies that the particular friend was skilled at playing cards, which is often described using the phrase "good at." The other options do not provide a satisfactory explanation for why the friend always won.
The sentence suggests that John has a negative emotional response to lying. Feeling guilty is a common psychological response to dishonesty, as it goes against moral values and ethics. Avoiding eye contact and blushing may also be associated with lying, but they are not necessarily correlated with the particular emotional response of guilt. Turning purple and falling asleep are not logical or expected outcomes of lying.
Aggression is typically associated with a competitive mindset and can give an individual an advantage in a competitive situation. Stress and defeat are typically negative emotions that can hinder performance, while anger may cloud judgment and detract from focus. "Pumped" is a less specific term and may not necessarily be useful in a competitive situation.
The sentence implies that the location of the dance club is related to the side that won the Civil War. The side that won the Civil War was the Union, which was primarily made up of Northern states. Therefore, the option furthest in the same direction as the side that won the Civil War would be a Southern location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The Coast Guard is a branch of the United States Armed Forces that is responsible for maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, and environmental protection. One of their primary duties is to board vessels to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, such as ensuring proper safety equipment is on board, verifying proper documentation and licenses, and checking for illegal activities such as drug trafficking or smuggling. The other options do not accurately describe the primary duties of the Coast Guard, which focus on maintaining safety and security on the water.
The sentence suggests that when you are swimming underwater, you need to come up to the surface to do something specific. Specifically, you need to do something related to breathing, which suggests that "breathe air" is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A well-dressed person visiting a box office suggests that they are going to attend a formal event. The options of "fox theater" or "theatre district" indicate locations that are known for hosting theatrical performances, and therefore are likely a correct answer. The option of "ballpark" would not require formal attire, and "counseling" has no connection to attending a formal event.
Divorce often represents the end of a relationship that may have been confining or unhappy, so the person who is getting divorced may feel a sense of liberation or freedom. This can manifest in different ways, such as being able to pursue new romantic relationships, travel more, or make other life changes. The other options are negative outcomes that are not usually associated with divorce, or at least not exclusively so.
The sentence suggests that the chief of police was trying to answer questions quickly to avoid something negative happening. In this case, the negative outcome may be confusion on the part of the person asking the questions. By answering quickly, the chief is trying to provide clear and concise answers that will avoid any confusion or misunderstandings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking about what you compete against someone in, which indicates that there is a specific event or activity being referred to. "Fair" and "false start" are not things that you compete against someone in. "Competitive" is an adjective that describes the nature of the activity, rather than the actual event being competed in. "Practice" is a way to prepare for a competition, but it is not the competition itself. Therefore, "in competition" is the most appropriate answer.
A corner shop is typically a small retail store located at the corner of a street, and it is commonly associated with selling a variety of goods, including hats. Therefore, the answer that is most likely, and is even specified in the question, is street corner. The other options such as subway, town, and Minnesota do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. England, while known for its fashion and hats, is not specifically mentioned in the sentence as being the location of the corner shop.
The question suggests that the key to doing things in a new way is to change the way one thinks about the task at hand. This implies that new perspectives are necessary to generate new ideas and approaches. Knowledge and sense might be helpful in some cases, but they don't necessarily lead to new ways of doing things. "Best way" and "figure out" both imply using existing methods or knowledge to solve a problem, which doesn't necessarily lead to innovation or creativity.
The other options listed do not make sense in the context of the question. A fridge and cupboard are used for storage, a field is where food is grown, and a table is where food is served. An oven, on the other hand, is commonly used to heat up food and is a common appliance found in kitchens for this purpose.
The word "hurry" suggests that the children are trying to complete a task quickly. "Run" is a verb commonly associated with moving quickly or with urgency, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not accurately describe actions someone might take when in a hurry.
The sentence suggests that running twenty six miles could have a dangerous consequence for someone with an underlying heart condition. Death is a severe but possible outcome in such a case. Tiredness and exhaustion may be expected outcomes for anyone who runs a marathon, but the sentence specifies an underlying heart condition, which indicates that the risks are higher for this person. Passing out and heartbreak are not relevant to the question's context.
Tin is a metal commonly used for making various household items like kitchenware and cans. As such, it is not likely to be found in a cupboard or grocery store. An antique store may have vintage tin items, but it is not a reliable source for acquiring the raw material. The best option for obtaining tin would be a hardware store where metals and tools are sold.
Going to the gym is often associated with exercising and improving one's physical fitness. Therefore, the most logical reason someone would start playing sports at the gym is to get in shape. This may involve a variety of activities, including strength training, cardio, and sports. The other options - practice, compete, have fun, and stretch - are all possible reasons why someone might play sports at the gym, but they are less directly related to the goal of improving physical fitness.
The sentence implies that the person being described has no obligations or responsibilities, which would free up their time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "spare time." The other options do not make sense in the sentence context.
The phrase "at the end of the day" usually refers to the time when a person is finished with their daily activities and ready to rest or sleep. The other options do not fit this context: "make money" suggests work, "cross street" suggests movement, "draw attention to themselves" suggests something attention-grabbing, and "come home" suggests going back to a specific location.
The sentence suggests that the work is purely theoretical or abstract, and therefore not applicable to practical situations. "Applied" is the opposite of theoretical or abstract, and it means that a theory or concept is used in practical situations. The other options, such as "contaminated" or "corrupt," have negative connotations that do not fit the context of the sentence.
The term "maid" typically refers to a person who is hired to clean and maintain a household. The phrase "start her work" implies that the maid is beginning her shift or starting to clean for the day. Out of the five options, "cleaning house" is the most general and inclusive, as it could refer to cleaning any room or area of the house. The other options are more specific and do not account for all the areas that a maid might clean, such as the kitchen or living room.
The sentence refers to "kids in elementary school," suggesting that the context is related to school lunches or snacks. Grapes are a common and healthy snack for kids, often packed in their lunch boxes by parents or caregivers. The other options (kitchen, wine country, fridge, food store) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would be unlikely places for elementary school kids to keep grapes.
The sentence indicates that the man is seeking representation for arbitration, which implies that a legal dispute is involved. The professional is providing assistance to avoid a potential negative outcome, and the most common negative outcome of a legal dispute is a lawsuit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Baseball games are a popular form of entertainment for many people, as they often provide an exciting and enjoyable experience. People may attend games to socialize with friends and family, cheer on their favorite team or player, or simply to enjoy the atmosphere and energy of the event. The other options (pain, stupid) do not align with the positive connotations typically associated with attending a baseball game, while delight and fun are similar in meaning to entertainment but not as commonly used in this context.
The use of the word "completely" suggests that the wife's emotions were intense and extreme. "Frenzied" is a stronger word than the other options and implies a loss of control or chaotic behavior, which would make it harder for the husband to remain calm. The other options suggest varying levels of discomfort or distress but not necessarily overwhelming emotions.
Cats are known for their instinctive behavior to cover their waste, and they may seek out a similar substrate to their litter box when it is full. Houseplants may be attractive to cats as they offer a similar texture to a litter box, and the soil may absorb urine. The other options such as the bathtub, dumpsters, and the floor do not have a close association with a cat's toileting behavior.
Cheese is a perishable dairy product that can spoil quickly if not stored properly. Refrigerators are known for keeping food fresh for longer periods of time as they slow down the growth of bacteria that can cause spoilage. Therefore, it is logical to assume that cheese would be stored in a refrigerator to maintain its freshness. The other options do not relate to the storage of cheese.
Construction workers are known for their work in building structures such as houses, buildings, and other infrastructure. They use a variety of tools and techniques to construct these structures, and their work is an essential part of many industries. The other options do not have any relation to the profession of construction workers.
The question implies that an expressway is leaving the US, which suggests that it is crossing a border. Among the options, only Canada is a neighboring country to the US and therefore the most likely destination for an expressway leaving the US. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking about the specific element that is required when creating art that involves singing. It is reasonable to assume that for singing to be a part of the art, the human voice is necessary. The other options do not necessarily relate to singing and art in the same way that voices do. Communication may be necessary for any type of art, while enlightenment, pride, and controversy do not necessarily have a direct connection to singing as an art form.
A library is a collection of books and other resources for reading, learning, and research. Therefore, it is more likely to have a large volume of text than a smaller area such as a bookshelf or a set of books. A collection of books or books can have different sizes and numbers, so they may or may not contain a large amount of text.
In a trial, a witness is someone who provides information and insight about a case. They may be called upon to testify or give testimony in order to provide evidence that supports one side or the other. The judge is a neutral third party who presides over the trial and makes rulings based on the evidence presented. While telling the truth is important for all parties involved, it is not a specific role in a trial.
Eating hamburgers too fast can cause a person to consume greater amounts of food without realizing it, which can contribute to weight gain. When a person eats quickly, they may not give their body sufficient time to register feelings of fullness and satisfaction, leading them to eat more than they need. Additionally, hamburgers are often high in calories and fat, which can contribute to weight gain over time. The other options listed may be potential consequences of eating too quickly or consuming unhealthy foods, but they do not directly relate to the question of what eating hamburgers too fast leads to.
The sentence is asking about how to find new items, which suggests actively searching for them. 'Look for' is the option that most directly indicates searching or seeking out something, making it the most appropriate answer. 'Go to movies' is irrelevant to the context of trying to find new items, while 'open eyes' and 'have eyes open' are redundant since having one's eyes open is assumed for visual search. 'Ask' is not necessarily the best option, as it assumes that someone else has the information about the new items, rather than the ability to find them oneself.
The sentence implies that there is a generational divide when it comes to music, with each generation finding the next's music to be unappealing or incomprehensible. This suggests that the correct answer is "music." The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that soldiers who are not deployed have a location where they can eat their food. The military base is a possible option, but the sentence suggests that soldiers who are not deployed would not be on the base. The other options do not make logical sense. Therefore, the correct answer is at home, as soldiers who are not actively serving would typically eat their meals in their own home or at a designated dining facility on the military base.
The sentence implies that the work that was done was successful, and as a result, it was time to celebrate. The other options do not fit the context of a successful completion of work, and thus are not correct.
The sentence indicates that the steel cable could be used to pull the tugboat, which would require some kind of mechanism to generate the pulling force. A winch is a common tool for this purpose, as it allows for controlled pulling and releasing of the cable. The other choices (wrench, suspension bridge, factory, and ship) do not make sense in the context of pulling the tugboat with a steel cable.
Eating lunch provides the body with necessary nutrients and calories that can be converted into energy for the body to use. This is why many people feel a boost in energy after eating lunch. The other options, such as feeling full, sleepy, or experiencing drowsiness, are not always the desired outcomes of eating lunch.
The question is asking about a system of measurement, and specifically mentions an inch measurement. The inch is part of the imperial system, which is used primarily in the United States. The other options include liquid measure, which refers to volume measurement, centimeter/centimetre, which is a unit of length in the metric system, and mile, which is a unit of distance in the imperial system. The correct answer must be a system of measurement that includes length and has a unit of measurement that can be converted to inches. The metric system is a logical choice because it is the standard system of measurement used internationally, and has a variety of units that include length measurements (such as the centimeter) that can be easily converted to inches.
The sentence suggests that the team was able to communicate effectively because they were able to anticipate each other's thoughts. This implies that they were able to work together seamlessly and were in sync with one another. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence; sending an email or ringing up the president of Bermuda are not related to effective communication within a team.
The question is asking where the president keeps his pajamas, which suggests that the answer is related to personal items or belongings. The option "white house" refers to the president's official residence and office, but it is unlikely that his personal items would be kept there. "Corporation", "country", and "government" are too broad and do not relate to personal belongings. "Closet" is the most logical answer as it is a place where people typically store their clothes and personal items.
The context of the sentence suggests that John is changing into athletic clothing, which typically implies that he is in a place where physical activity or exercise is taking place. The most likely option based on this clue is a gym, which is a facility dedicated to fitness and exercise. The other options do not have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam enjoys going to restaurants, but there is a specific thing that he forgets to do. The options "make reservations," "polite," "prepared to pay," and "drinking wine" do not fit the context of the sentence. However, "pay the bill" is a common thing that people forget to do in restaurants, especially if they are used to someone else paying for them or if they are distracted by the food or conversation.
The question is asking about the qualities or characteristics that a server needs in order to provide good service to customers. Being polite is a common trait associated with good customer service, as it involves treating customers with respect, showing good manners, and being attentive to their needs. The other choices do not necessarily relate to customer service or may even be irrelevant, such as having a driver's license or making money.
Ironing boards are commonly used for ironing clothing and other fabrics after they have been ironed. The other options are not typical places to put something after ironing it. The house and kitchen are too broad and do not provide a specific location, while the linen closet and laundry room are places where clothing and linens are stored, not ironed.
The word "safe" implies that the basement is a safer location compared to somewhere else in the context of the sentence. However, the word "still" suggests that there is still some level of danger present despite being in the basement. The phrase "put them" indicates that they were exposed to danger caused by the weather, which makes "in danger" the most appropriate answer. The other options may be similar, but "in danger" is the most accurate and idiomatic choice.
Eating large amounts of fatty and greasy foods, such as hamburgers, can lead to heartburn. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. This is a common side effect of overeating or eating foods that are difficult for the stomach to digest. Gas, being full, death, and food poisoning do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that John plays brass instruments in a band that has a diverse group of people and many different instruments. This suggests that the band plays a type of music that incorporates a variety of instruments and styles, which is characteristic of jazz music. Additionally, the fact that they mostly play at clubs further supports the idea that they are a jazz band, as jazz music is often associated with small club settings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that waiting for a bus that has already passed is a result of poor timing. Timing refers to the ability to choose the right moment to do something, and waiting for a bus that has already passed likely means that the person missed their opportunity to catch the bus due to poor timing. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for the situation described in the sentence.
The sentence implies that people had to wait while they washed their clothes at the laundromat, and that most people spent this time doing something else. Watching TV is a common activity for people who have to wait for extended periods of time, so it makes sense that this would be the answer. The other options (time, singing, getting wet, socks) do not fit with the context of the sentence.
Investment bankers are often associated with high-income and luxurious lifestyles, which could suggest that they would frequent exclusive, upscale venues such as country clubs. Country clubs are typically known for their lavish amenities and services, making them a likely destination for individuals with significant wealth. The other options, such as Wall Street and City Hall, are more closely associated with financial institutions and government offices, respectively, and do not match the context of the question. Monopoly game and Michigan are also not likely options, as they do not represent real-life locations.
The sentence suggests that the person was surprised by the FBI's interest in their Facebook posts, which implies that the posts may have been controversial or expressed opinions that are not widely accepted. The options "money," "food and water," and "compliments" do not seem relevant to this context. "Freedom of information" could be a possible answer, but it does not fully capture the person's surprise and shock. "Freedom of expression," however, is a right that allows individuals to express themselves freely, even if it may be controversial or unpopular, and this is likely what the person wanted but felt threatened by the FBI's actions.
The sentence suggests that the reason the teacher could write off paper clips was because they were necessary for her work. Businesses can typically write off expenses that are necessary for conducting their work, so the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is "work." The other options (drawer, fashioned into simple tools, desktop, university) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the class was touring a location related to space and shuttle launches. Cape Kennedy is known for its connection to space travel and NASA, as it is the site of the Kennedy Space Center. Florida is also a possible answer as it is the state where the Kennedy Space Center is located. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
Welding, home improvement, and manufacturing are all areas where metal rods are commonly used, and these activities usually take place in shops or factories. Broken bones are not related to the context of the sentence, and construction sites may use metal rods, but they are not the primary focus of the sentence. Cars and engines are also not mentioned in the sentence and have no clear connection to the context provided.
The sentence suggests that cereal manufacturers make a decision about how to package their product, which is typically in a box. Cereal boxes are a common sight in grocery stores and households, and they are designed to keep the cereal fresh and easily accessible. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a cabinet or cupboard may be where cereal is stored, a fridge may be used for certain types of cereal, but these are not decisions made by cereal manufacturers. Mouth is also not a relevant option as it is not related to the packaging or storage of cereal.
The U.S. federal government is located in Washington D.C., which is the capital of the United States. The other options, such as Canada and country, are unrelated to the location of the U.S. federal government. The Capitol Building is a specific building in Washington D.C. where government officials meet, but it is not a location where the entire U.S. federal government is housed. Democracy is a political system, but it does not directly relate to the physical location of the U.S. federal government.
The question asks for an item that allows you to hear others but not be heard yourself, indicating that it has some sort of one-way communication functionality. Both television and radio simply broadcast without any interaction, so they do not fit the criteria. The mouth and song both involve speaking, making it impossible to solely listen. A telephone, on the other hand, allows you to hear the other person's voice through the receiver while your own voice is only transmitted when you speak into the microphone, making it the correct answer.
The opposite of being free is being enslaved, which means being held against one's will and forced to work or serve someone without the ability to leave or make choices independently. The other options do not accurately reflect the opposite of being free. Being paid for or expensive suggests a transactional element, while imprisoned or locked up suggest confinement without necessarily implying forced labor.
The context of the sentence suggests that the folding chairs are meant to be used specifically for religious experiences, implying that they will be stored in a location related to religious activities. Among the given options, only "church" fits this description. The other options are more general and do not necessarily have any connection to religious activities.
The sentence suggests that bombs are dropped during wartime and provides a specific location where this is likely to happen. Afghanistan is known to be a country where the US has been involved in military conflicts and where bombing has taken place. The other options either have no connection to warfare or are not known for being targets of bombing during wartime.
The sentence suggests that the person is having difficulty breathing, which is a common symptom of oxygen deprivation. At high altitudes, the air is thinner and has less oxygen, which can cause shortness of breath and other symptoms. The other options are unlikely to be the cause of breathing difficulties in this context.
The sentence implies that the toddler was sleeping, and is now waking up. It is common for people to feel tired after waking up from a nap, so the correct answer is likely related to a feeling commonly associated with waking up. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence – nervousness, eyes opening and getting out of bed are usually associated with waking up from a deep sleep, while discomfort may or may not be present depending on the toddler's sleeping position or other factors.
The question is asking for a solution to the problem of a poor road surface, which would not involve any of the given choices. "Object" and "yell" are not viable solutions, and "tetrahedron," "mirror," and "lake" are unrelated to the problem. A more appropriate answer might be to report the issue to the appropriate authority or to seek out a route with better road conditions.
The sentence suggests that the situation being discussed is dangerous, which implies that the person would be focused on staying alive. Compliments and talking fast are unlikely to be helpful in a dangerous situation, and high wages and a husband or wife are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
A garden is typically a place where plants are grown and cultivated, so the most logical answer would be "plant flowers." "Work" is too general and could refer to a variety of activities that might take place in a garden, such as weeding or pruning. "Catch cold" is not an activity that someone would intentionally do in a garden. "Gain respect" is not related to the context of the question, and "fish lake" is not an activity typically associated with a garden.
The sentence suggests that the person in question did not want to answer any calls, so he turned off his phone. The phrase "all anybody was going to hear from him today" suggests that he was planning to communicate a message of some sort, and the fact that he turned off his phone suggests that he did not want to do so over a live call. Therefore, the most likely answer is "answering machine" since it is a device used to record messages when someone is unable to answer a phone call. The other options, such as "office" or "telephonelines," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a monkey picking bananas from a tree, which is an activity often associated with monkeys that live in rain forests. Rain forests are known for being home to a diverse array of animal and plant species, including monkeys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the artificial intelligence was constantly analyzing data, which is a process commonly associated with machine learning. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms that can learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the AI was programmed to always be learning more about the data it was analyzing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question is about throwing something in December, which implies that it is likely to be a winter activity. The mention of water suggests that the answer should have some association with freezing or cold temperatures, which makes snowball the most suitable option. Tsunami, puddle, glass, and backpack do not match the context and don't make sense in the question.
John is lost and looking for direction, so it makes sense that he would need a map. An atlas is a collection of maps and is commonly used for navigation purposes. The other options, such as taco bell, amusement park, or classroom, do not provide any helpful resources for John to find his way. A truck stop may sell maps, but an atlas is a more specific and likely option for John's needs.
The sentence mentions that Jerry had a super sense of humor, which is often associated with making people laugh. The phrase "entertaining" also suggests that Jerry was providing amusement or enjoyment to his audience, which is typically achieved through humor and laughter. The other options do not directly relate to humor or entertainment.
The sentence describes a type of railing that is typically found on a structure with stairs or steps that lead upwards, such as a flight of stairs. The other options listed do not typically have railings for holding onto while moving up, and are therefore not the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that encountering a snake on a plane is an uncommon occurrence, but more likely to happen while out in nature. Snakes are typically found in natural habitats, such as forests or grasslands. The options "pet shop" and "France" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, while "tropical forest" is a possible contender but less specific than "nature" which can refer to many different types of natural environments.
New York is a famous location for movies and has many iconic subway stations that have been used in films. The other options may also have subway stations, but New York is the most well-known for its subway system and has been featured in countless movies over the years.
The question refers to understanding testimony, which suggests that the listener is trying to grasp the information being conveyed. To do this successfully, they would need to engage in careful listening, which involves paying close attention to the speaker's words and tone, as well as any nonverbal cues. Ears and ability to hear are necessary for hearing the testimony, but they do not necessarily guarantee understanding. Change of heart and sleepiness are not relevant to the question.
The sentence suggests that the students were gathered in one place for an announcement, but then began to move away from that location. The word "disperse" means to scatter or go in different directions, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices don't make sense in this context - "spread" and "disseminate" may imply the students shared information, while "park" and "dispense" don't have any connection to the idea of the students moving away from one location.
Lying in bed for extended periods of time can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers or bed sores, especially for patients who are bedridden or have limited mobility. Therefore, the most likely answer is "patient". The other options may not necessarily be lying in bed or may not be at as high of a risk for developing wounds.
The process of water turning into ice is called freezing, and involves the formation of crystals as water molecules slow down and arrange themselves into a solid structure. The other options do not accurately describe the process of water becoming ice.
The sentence suggests that Sarah's husband was already aware of something related to the trip, which is why the surprise failed. The correct option would be "known about" because it directly implies a pre-existing knowledge of the trip. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "predictable" and "bland" describe qualities of something, while "bought tickets" and "sneaky" imply actions and intentions.
The question specifies that the police officer is in their sixties, which suggests that they may be nearing retirement age. Typically, police officers retire in their late 50s or early 60s, depending on their years of service and the specific retirement plan they are enrolled in. The other options do not necessarily have any correlation with age or retirement.
A garage is a place where automobiles are stored and kept safe, so it makes sense that it would be a good place for an automobile to be. A driveway is also a possibility, but it is not necessarily a "good" place as it is open to the elements and other potential hazards. A repair shop and junk yard are places where automobiles go when they are damaged or no longer functioning properly, so they are not good places to be for a working automobile. An exit ramp is a section of a highway where cars exit, and it is not a place for an automobile to be parked or stored.
The use of the word "poor" suggests that the person may not have regular access to food, and therefore their primary goal would be to survive by obtaining enough nutrients to sustain themselves. While digesting and being full are important aspects of the process, the key goal is to avoid starvation. Getting fat is not a necessary or desirable outcome for a person who is struggling to obtain food.
The sentence implies that the person was unaware of the edibility of a blowfish and that they were surprised to see it in a particular location. A fish market is a plausible location where a blowfish could be encountered as it is a place where various types of seafood are sold. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Tables are commonly associated with dining rooms, where people gather to eat together. The other options do not logically fit the context of the question. A furniture store may sell tables, but it is not where people typically have them. A kitchen may have a table for eating as well, but it is not the most common location. A bathroom or conference room would be an unlikely location for a table.
The sentence suggests that Sally wants to keep her saltshaker in a convenient location, but also one that is not intrusive. This rules out options such as the dinner table or table setting, which are typically used for preparing and serving food. The own kitchen option is too vague, as it could refer to any location in the kitchen. The cabinet option is also incorrect, as this would require Sally to reach up or bend down to access the saltshaker, which would not be considered a convenient location. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the kitchen counter, which is a common location for frequently-used items like salt and pepper shakers.
The question is asking how we could get far enough up into the air around Earth that we cannot be seen. Using a balloon, space shuttle, or house would not take us high enough to be out of sight. A supermarket is not even a method of transportation, so it is not a viable option. A rocket, on the other hand, can propel us far enough away from Earth that we would not be visible without instruments. Therefore, rocket is the correct answer.
The four horsemen of the apocalypse are often depicted as death, famine, war, and conquest. In many depictions, death and war are positioned next to each other, suggesting a connection between the two. The other options, such as battlefield or hospital, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that people are acting in an unusual way, which is often described using words like "weird" or "odd". These words imply that their behavior does not conform to social norms, and may be seen as strange or inexplicable by others. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior being discussed, and would not be appropriate choices to complete the sentence.
Weasels are known to be small, agile hunters that are able to navigate through tight spaces. A loose weasel in a hen house would be particularly destructive because weasels are known to prey on small animals like chickens, and a loose weasel would likely be able to move freely through the hen house and hunt without being noticed. The other options are less likely to be affected by a loose weasel, as they either do not have significant populations of animals vulnerable to weasel predation, or are too expansive to be meaningfully impacted by a single weasel.
The question suggests that the focus is on protecting one's legs from getting dirty on a farm. Wearing jeans is a common practice on farms as they are sturdy and thick enough to protect one's legs from mud, dirt, and scratches. Milking cows, belief in God, planting flowers, and avoiding mud do not directly address the issue of protecting one's legs while working on a farm.
The sentence suggests that there is a certain reaction that men have when they see a nude woman on TV. Based on common reactions and stereotypes surrounding male sexuality, it is likely that the correct answer is erections. The other options do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the only remaining evidence of the ancient giant lizards are fossils and something else. Fossils are remnants of bones or other hard body parts of extinct organisms, which is why bones is the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as sex to produce offspring and having four legs are not unique to ancient giant lizards and pictures are not physical remnants of the species.
Plates are typically stored in a cabinet in the kitchen or dining area of a home. They may also be found on a table when they are being used for eating, but this is not a permanent storage location. Plates are not typically stored in a dishwasher or a fridge, which are used for washing and storing food, respectively. Finally, a restaurant is not a location within a home and is therefore not a probable answer to this question.
The sentence suggests that the expected response to a funny joke is laughter. If someone laughs at your joke, it means that they found it amusing, and there is no surprise involved. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Scaring someone, receiving flowers, or keeping a secret are all unrelated to telling a joke, and crying is typically not a common response to humor.
The sentence suggests that attending meetings can be boring for some people. The phrase "fall asleep" is commonly associated with being bored or uninterested in something. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A bus station is typically located in or near the city centre, as it serves as a transportation hub where people can easily access various parts of the city. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the performance in question is interactive, which means that it involves active participation from the audience. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this aspect of the performance. "Experience" is the best choice, as it suggests that the person wants to engage with the performance in some way. The other options ("know where," "leave," "applaud," and "admiration") do not capture the interactive nature of the performance described in the sentence.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law. Therefore, someone committing perjury is likely lying. The other options do not relate to the definition or meaning of perjury.
A meeting that is described as "large" implies that a significant number of people will be present, and thus a venue with sufficient space is required. Among the options, conference halls are specifically designed for this purpose and are frequently used for large-scale gatherings such as conventions or meetings. The other choices are not as applicable to this context; for example, a church may not have the necessary technology for a large meeting, a dormitory is unlikely to have a dedicated space for a gathering of this size, and a library may not have the seating capacity for such an event.
The phrase "giant wall of water" is commonly associated with tsunamis, which are large waves caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. The other options, such as backpack, allen key, and snowball, do not have any association with the given phrase. The option "ocean" may seem plausible, but it does not fully capture the context of the sentence, as the phrase describes a specific type of wave and not the entire body of water.
Brownstones are a type of row house that is commonly found in cities like New York. They are known for their architectural features, such as ornate entryways and facades, and are often associated with wealth and luxury. Given the context of the sentence, it is likely that the answer is related to theft or burglary. A ring is a valuable item that is often targeted by thieves due to its small size and high value, making it a likely choice for what someone might try to steal from a brownstone. The other options - subdivision, live in, new york city, and circlet - do not have any clear connection to theft or brownstones.
The sentence suggests that the song is well-known and that it is about a girl with a particular physical characteristic. The phrase "eyes that were" indicates that the song is describing the color of the girl's eyes. Of the choices given, only "blue" and "brown" are commonly used to describe the color of eyes. "Green" could also be a possibility, but it is less common. "Sad" and "tear up" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a potential feeling that someone may experience as a result of jogging. While increased heart rate and improved health are positive outcomes of exercise, they are not necessarily feelings. Frightened is unlikely to be a feeling associated with jogging unless the context provides more information. Shin splints may be a physical sensation that someone experiences while jogging, but it is not a feeling. Being tired is a possible feeling that someone may experience after jogging, as it can be a physically demanding activity.
The word "cogitating" implies deep and prolonged thinking or contemplation, which can often lead to mental strain or exhaustion. This is reflected in the option "headaches," which is a common side effect of intensive thinking. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a "wild animal" caused the damage to the carpeting, indicating that the perpetrator was not likely to be a human being. The term "cub" refers to a young animal, such as a bear or a lion, which could have caused the damage. The other options are unlikely to be the culprit because they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location is a place where people gather to listen to someone speaking on a regular basis. A church is a common place of worship where people attend services and listen to sermons preached by a religious leader. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not typically involve a speaker addressing an audience.
The sentence suggests that the school is putting on some kind of theatrical production that involves children acting. Of the choices provided, "play" is the term commonly used to refer to a staged production of a story or script. "Movies" and "television" refer to visual media that are typically not performed live, while "fancy dress" suggests a costume party or event that is not necessarily related to acting. "Show" is a more general term that could refer to any type of performance or exhibition, but "play" is the most specific answer that fits the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the clean laundry is located in the basement, which typically means that the person will need to go up a flight of stairs to reach the bedroom. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that would help in choosing the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that people who need money badly may resort to doing something illegal, which is a common reason to commit crimes. While "part company" and "go swimming" are not related to the context of the sentence, "criminal" is a broad term that does not provide a clear answer. "Believe in god" also does not provide a clear answer and is not related to the context of the sentence.
Nelson Mandela was a prominent political figure in South Africa and his grave site would likely be located in his home country. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where the grave site might be located. The reference to an apple tree may be a distractor and not relevant to the answer.
The question is asking where someone might have a statement printed, which implies that it is being distributed or published to a larger audience. While it is possible to have a statement printed and mailed, or included in a letter, these options are more limited in terms of distribution. A press release is also a possibility, but typically these are distributed to media outlets rather than printed directly. A smartphone is a device, not a location for printing. A newspaper, on the other hand, is commonly used for publishing statements and other information for a broader audience.
The sentence suggests that when shopping for an expensive product, it is important to get the best deal. The best way to ensure this is by comparing prices of the product at different stores before making a purchase. Standing in line, meeting friends, and living without it are not relevant to getting the best deal, and "purchasing" is not a helpful suggestion as it is already assumed that the person will be making a purchase.
Lizards are often found in places where they can bask in the sun, hide in crevices, and have access to insects and other small prey. A backyard or garden can provide all of these things, making them a likely location to find lizards. Rock walls, stream beds, and the great outdoors can also be home to lizards, but they are less commonly associated with them than backyards and gardens.
Exercising vigorously results in the breakdown of muscle fibers, which then rebuild stronger and larger during the process of muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, building muscles is a direct and logical outcome of exercising vigorously. Options such as need for food and thirst are related to exercising but not necessarily to vigorous exercise specifically, while sweating is a side effect of exercise but doesn't necessarily indicate building muscles. Fitness itself is a goal of exercising but not something that is physically built in the same way as muscles.
The word "office" is typically associated with work and the workplace. The other options, such as a zoo or school building, typically do not have large numbers of office spaces. "Public building" and "city" are more general terms and do not specifically reference a location where there would be a large number of offices.
The phrase "surprising strike" suggests that this is referring to a sudden and unexpected work stoppage, which is commonly referred to as a strike. The context of the sentence implies that this strike is related to some sort of labor issue, such as a disagreement between workers and management over wages, benefits, or working conditions. The other options (funny, frightened, humor, and fight) do not make sense in the given sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is at a high elevation with no buildings around, which indicates that they are likely in a mountainous area. Skiing is a popular recreational activity in mountainous regions, which makes it a likely answer to the question. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Snakes are known to use camouflage and hiding to ambush their prey. Of the given options, only "deep grass" could provide adequate hiding for a snake. The other options are unlikely or unsuitable for snake habitation or hiding.
The sentence implies that the installation of lights was intended to attract visitors to a particular location. It is unlikely that lights would be installed on a carnival or a plane, as these are mobile and temporary structures. A yatch (or yacht) might have lights installed for safety reasons, but not necessarily to attract visitors. "Turned at night" does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, "building" is the most logical and likely option.
The word "native" implies that the ficus tree originally came from a certain place or region. "Apartment," "zoo," and "dictionary" are not locations where plants are native to, so they can be eliminated as incorrect choices. The ficus tree is commonly found in tropical regions, which makes "tropical forest" the most likely correct answer. The middle east is not typically associated with the ficus tree.
The question specifically mentions that the friend is unable to lift the groceries themselves, so it is important to take action to assist them. Out of the given options, "offering to help" would be the most appropriate choice in this situation. "Write letter" and "promise to help" may not provide immediate assistance, while "relying on" the friend could lead to them being unable to complete their errand. "Do not help" would be an inappropriate option and would not fulfill the ethical responsibility to help a friend in need.
The sentence suggests that the person in question was not only interested in killing their victims, but also in causing them additional suffering. The word "revenge" implies that they were seeking some kind of payback for a perceived wrongdoing, and the choice of "anguish" suggests that they wanted their victims to suffer emotionally, perhaps in addition to physical pain. The other options may be possible outcomes of the person's actions, but they do not directly align with the context of the sentence.
Shiny advertisements are often found in magazines as they are printed on glossy paper that enhances the colors and shine of the ad. Ads in emails are typically not shiny as they are viewed on a screen. Store advertisements may be shiny, but the context of the sentence suggests that the ad is portable or in a specific location. Bus advertisements may be shiny but the context suggests that the ad is not moving. Closets are not typically used for advertisements.
A soup kitchen is a place where free food is offered to those in need, often homeless or low-income individuals. The other choices have no logical connection to the purpose of a soup kitchen.
The American Civil War was primarily fought over the issue of slavery. Many states in the South relied heavily on the slave trade to support their economy, while Northern states were increasingly opposed to the practice. As tensions rose between the two regions, the issue of slavery became a flashpoint for conflict and eventually led to the outbreak of war. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
This question is asking for a potential negative effect of exercising. While lifting weights and running are forms of exercise, they are not necessarily negative effects. Collapsing is a potential negative effect, but it is not a common one. Error is not related to exercising. Shortness of breath, however, is a common negative effect, especially for those who are new to exercising or have certain health conditions.
The sentence suggests that nails need to be placed somewhere in order to prevent them from causing damage to other items in proximity. Putting nails in a cabinet would likely keep them out of sight and away from other objects, reducing the likelihood of damage. The other options do not seem to provide a clear solution to the problem presented.
Washing clothes manually involves manually rubbing the clothes while they are submerged in a basin or bucket of water and soap. This process requires getting your hands wet and may also require bending down to manipulate the clothes, making getting wet a likely outcome. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of washing clothes manually.
The use of emergency vehicles suggests that there was likely some kind of accident or emergency situation that occurred on the road. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The words "calm" and "productive" suggest that the carpet is being installed in a professional or work-related environment, where employees need to be focused and efficient. The options "bowling alley" and "church" do not fit this description. Although a carpet could be installed in a building or floor, these options are too broad and do not provide specific context for the type of environment the carpet is being installed in, leaving "office" as the most logical choice.
Singers typically go to a studio to record and produce music. Although warming up and clearing their throats may be a part of the process, the ultimate goal is to create a final product. "Sound beautiful" and "make noise" are not specific enough to be the correct answer, whereas "create music" accurately summarizes the purpose of a singer's visit to a studio.
The question implies that someone is engaging in a leisure activity (chatting with friends) while also attempting to engage in a physical activity (working out). Therefore, it can be inferred that the reason for chatting is to add an element of enjoyment or pleasure to the workout, rather than seeking answers or inspiration. "Fun" is the most appropriate answer choice out of the given options.
The phrase "hunkered down" suggests that Cameron was trying to stay warm. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he was sleeping "under the covers," which reinforces the idea that he was trying to stay warm. The other options, such as "talking," "snoring," or "wet bed," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Might dream" is possible, but it is not directly supported by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is already in possession of a meal, indicating that they probably don't need to order food or spend money. The fact that they are hungry suggests that they are likely to eat quickly in order to alleviate their hunger. Beginning work or having lunch may be options for later once the person has satisfied their immediate hunger.
Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions, but the question specifies a midwestern area. The Great Plains and jungle are not known for having mountain terrain or marmots, making those choices unlikely. The option of an encyclopedia is not a geographical area where a marmot could run free. Therefore, the most likely choice is countryside, which could include hilly or rocky areas that could potentially be home to marmots. The zoo would not have a marmot running free as they are typically kept in enclosures.
The question suggests that a television is being used specifically at night, which implies that someone is trying to watch TV while they are in bed. Therefore, the most likely option is a bedroom. A cabinet, house, or apartment could all contain a bedroom, but without further context it is impossible to determine if these answers are correct. The option "woods" is clearly incorrect as it has no connection to the given context.
The sentence implies that Sean put away his groceries, which suggests that he may have put the teabags in the same place. The options "mug," "refrigerator," and "teapot" are unlikely places to put teabags away, and the option "internet cafe" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The most likely place to store teabags at home is in a cupboard, making this the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the scenario takes place in the midwest and involves someone being chased, which implies that the answer will be something that is commonly found in rural or outdoor areas. Cornfields are a common crop in the midwest and provide ample cover for someone to hide in, making it the most practical choice. The other options, such as workplace, restroom, Star Trek, and space, have no connection to the scenario described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone who grows up poor in America can ultimately achieve financial success. The word "end up" implies a change in economic status from poor to rich. The other choices do not accurately reflect this specific context of social mobility and economic success.
The sentence suggests that someone might acquire beads while on a balcony, which is a common tradition during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. During Mardi Gras, people throw beads from balconies as part of the celebration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When someone is on trial for killing another person, the jury's decision would typically be based on whether the person is guilty or not guilty of the crime. If found guilty, the jury would likely decide on a punishment, which could include going to jail. Execution is a possible punishment in some jurisdictions, but it is not always an option. Investigation is something that is done by law enforcement to gather evidence, while retribution is not a legal concept in the same way that punishment is.
A butcher knife is a type of kitchen knife that is typically used for cutting, trimming, and preparing meat. Therefore, it is important to keep it in a place that is easily accessible in the kitchen, such as a kitchen drawer. Keeping it in a fishing boat, backpack, or pocket would not be practical or safe, as it could potentially harm someone accidentally. While a shelf might be an option, it may not be as secure or easily accessible as a kitchen drawer.
The sentence mentions that Sally's boss told her to stop playing because she was being loud. This suggests that Sally was playing a musical instrument like an organ, which can produce loud sounds. The other options, such as telegram, telegraph, motor, and chess, do not involve making loud noises and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the question is suggesting a place where one would bring a picnic basket filled with food. The correct answer is "bringing to picnic" as it directly relates to the context of the question. The other options, such as "country", "supermarket", "kitchen", and "deli" do not fit the context of this question as they do not involve bringing a picnic basket filled with food to a specific location.
The sentence suggests that the teacher's job was focused on teaching and that she took pride in it. The phrase "getting kids to" implies that the teacher's goal was to help the students learn something, which is supported by the fact that she took great pride in her work. The other options do not necessarily involve teaching or education and are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The presence of a cannon suggests that this is a location related to warfare or military history. A fort is a structure used for military defense and is commonly associated with cannons and historical warfare. A pirate ship may also have a cannon, but it is not typically used as an educational location for learning about history. A warship and war museum may have cannons as well, but a fort is more specifically related to the context of the question.
The sentence provides context clues that suggest the ficus, which is too big for Billy's house, is currently waiting outside. The most logical place for a potted plant to wait outside would be in another pot/container, hence the correct answer being "large pot." The other options, such as park or maze, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A tropical forest or a green house could be a possibility, but it is not indicated in the sentence whether the ficus is in one of these locations.
The question suggests that the creature is invisible, which means it is likely hiding or camouflaged. The option "dark place" implies that the creature may be hiding in a location where it is difficult to see, while the other options do not provide any insight into the whereabouts of the creature. The zoo option is unlikely because creatures in a zoo are typically visible to the public, and in a cage or woods, it would still be possible to see the creature even if it is hiding.
The sentence suggests that John is hiding, and specifically mentions that he pulled a cover over his head. This implies that he is somewhere underneath the cover, such as hiding under a blanket or sheet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When it comes to designing a shower, the most common material used for both the walls and floor is tiles. Tiles are durable, easy to clean, and water-resistant, making them an ideal choice for an area that is constantly exposed to water. While some people may choose other materials for their shower, such as stone or acrylic, these options are less common and may not provide the same level of functionality as tiles. The other options listed are not materials typically associated with showers.
The sentence suggests that going to the public store when sad may evoke a particular feeling. The most appropriate answer would be sorrow, as this emotion is typically associated with sadness. Embarrassment, pain, sleepy, and panic do not seem to relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the visitor had a positive experience at the hotel, which is the opposite of the previous hotel that was bad. The phrase "first rate" implies that the visitor thought the hotel was excellent or top-notch. The other options do not convey a strong positive sentiment and/or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence describes the dime store as being full of "old donated goods," which suggests that the items in the store are outdated or from a previous era. The phrase "reminded the customer of the" indicates that the correct answer will describe something from the past. Therefore, the correct answer is "past." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is regarding the process of buying beer at a store. When buying any product at a store, one usually has to pay for it, which is done by spending money. The other options, such as filling bottles, having fun, or stupidity, do not seem to be related to the process of buying beer at a store.
The question asks about the consequence of hurting someone else, which suggests that the action is considered illegal or harmful in some way. Legal problems are a common consequence of hurting someone else, as the injured party may choose to take legal action against the person who caused harm. Punishment may also be a consequence, but that generally involves legal processes and may overlap with legal problems. Happiness is unlikely to be a consequence of harming someone else, and physical pain and public outcry are not consequences that are directly related to the legal system or breaking the law.
The sentence implies that the person is looking for an affordable location to have a reception, which suggests that fancy or high-end options like a country club or restaurant may be too expensive. Outside could be an option, but has no clear association with affordability. A church basement is often a common, cost-effective choice for weddings and receptions. A wedding party is not a location, so it can be eliminated as an option.
The sentence mentions "barbecuing kangaroo meat" and "camping in the outback," which are both strongly associated with Australia. Kangaroos are native to Australia and are often used as a source of meat there. The outback is a vast, remote region in Australia known for its rugged and arid landscape, and camping is a popular activity in this area. The other options, such as retail store, Detroit, Wyoming, and Michigan park, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the objective is to remove the skin from an apple, which is typically done by peeling it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person is a mechanic, which is a profession that involves repairing and maintaining machines. As such, they would likely need a variety of tools to perform their job, including wrenches, sockets, and screwdrivers. The other options are specific to certain types of machines, such as an oil machine with grease or oil engine, or machine parts and machine tools, which may be required for manufacturing and production processes. However, a mechanic would primarily need tools to perform repairs and maintenance on various machines.
A ring road is a type of road that encircles a city or town, providing a bypass for through-traffic and connecting various highways and roads. It is unlikely to find a ring road for a motorcycle, as a motorcycle is a single vehicle and would not need a bypass road around a city or town. The other options are all possible locations for a ring road.
The sentence implies that spending the whole day shopping can have a negative effect on the body or mind. Obesity, bankruptcy, and debt are all financial or health-related outcomes that do not directly relate to shopping. Calluses are a physical effect on the hands or feet, but they are not necessarily caused by shopping. Tiredness, on the other hand, is a common result of spending a long time on one's feet, moving from store to store, and making numerous decisions, making it the most likely answer.
The word "solicitor" suggests that we are talking about a legal professional. Legal professionals often charge clients on an hourly basis, meaning that they would charge according to their time spent on a case. Buying a house, claiming compensation, writing a letter, and going to court may all be things that a solicitor does, but those actions do not necessarily guarantee revenue. Charging clients for their time spent on a case is a primary way that solicitors make money.
Both hospitals and doctor's offices are places where medical treatment can be received for an illness. While an elderly or sick person may receive care at these locations, they are not the solutions themselves. Stomach is also not a feasible answer as it is merely an organ and cannot treat an illness.
After a salad bowl has been used, it can either be washed in the dishwasher or put away in the cupboard. The dishwasher is a common place to clean dishes, including bowls, after they have been used. However, if the bowl is not dirty enough to require a full wash, it may be put away in the cupboard for future use. Salad bars, buffets, and trash cans are not appropriate places to put a used salad bowl.
The sentence suggests that the place being described specialized in colorful arrangements, which is commonly associated with flowers. Additionally, the mention of a toy balloon suggests that the place may cater to children or events such as birthday parties, which is also commonly associated with flower shops. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the beauty salon is located within a larger complex of shops, as it mentions people coming and going to various stores. This is typically characteristic of a strip mall, which is a type of shopping center where stores are arranged in a row or strip, often with a shared parking lot. The other options do not have any clear connection to the idea of a group of shops located together.
The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that is the opposite of fun. Playing around, activity, video games, and relaxing are all things that can be associated with having fun, so they cannot be the opposite. Effort, on the other hand, can often be associated with things that are not fun, such as hard work or chores. Therefore, effort is the most fitting answer for the opposite of having fun.
The sentence suggests that the couple had a membership that provided access to both golfing and tennis, which is a common feature of country clubs. Country clubs often offer a range of amenities, including golf courses, tennis courts, and other recreational facilities, which would explain why the husband and wife were both happy with their membership. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Generally, someone wouldn't intentionally park a moving car unless they are experiencing an emergency situation, such as avoiding an accident. Parking a moving car can be extremely dangerous and is not a common practice. The other options, such as getting a ticket or getting tired, do not make sense in the context of the question.
The question asks about the likely outcome of loving someone, and the answer "bring joy" is most consistent with common beliefs and experiences about love. Love is often associated with positive feelings and experiences, such as happiness and contentment, which can bring joy to both people involved in the relationship. The other options, such as giving money or hurting someone, are not typically associated with healthy or loving relationships.
Colleges are typically found in larger cities or towns, where there is a larger population and greater demand for higher education institutions. Building and electrical circuit do not make sense as options since they are not typically associated with the location of colleges. Fraternity house is a specific type of housing for college students, but it is not a location where multiple colleges would be found. Big town could also be a possibility, but big city is a more clear and obvious choice.
The sentence is asking about a place where humans go to escape cities, which suggests that the correct answer is a location that is outside of a city. The options "movie theatre" and "university" do not fit this criteria, as they are typically located within a city. The option "country" appears twice, but it is unclear which one is the correct answer. However, the option "park" fits the context of the sentence, as parks are often located outside of a city and provide a natural setting for people to escape the urban environment.
The question suggests that there is an alternative to having candy as a sweet snack, and the correct answer is likely to be a viable and healthy option. Eating fruit is a common substitute for sugary treats, as it provides natural sweetness, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or inappropriate for humans craving a sweet snack.
The sentence suggests that the real estate agent was able to persuade people to do things in a potentially manipulative way. The other options either do not have a negative connotation or do not fit the context of the sentence. Manipulation is often associated with persuasive tactics that are not entirely honest or transparent, which aligns with the idea of "getting anybody to do anything."
The sentence suggests that the current location of the outdoor restaurant is not suitable for rain, indicating that it may be exposed to the elements. Moving to a building would provide shelter and protect customers from the rain, making it a logical choice. While the other options may provide different environments, they do not directly address the issue of rain.
Gambling often involves putting money at risk, so it is likely that a common outcome of gambling is losing money. Penury and bankruptcy suggest a more extreme financial situation than simply losing money, and addiction and risky suggest a more emotional or behavioral response to gambling rather than a direct financial outcome.
The sentence suggests that the woman was a bad pet owner who did something inappropriate to her cat. Out of the given options, a wool sweater is the most likely object that one would put on a cat, and it is also something that a cat may not be comfortable wearing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The context implies that the washcloth needs to be cleaned, which suggests that it needs to be washed. Bathroom sinks are commonly used for washing and cleaning purposes, like washing your hands or face, so it would be logical to put a washcloth in the bathroom sink to clean it. The other options, like bed bath store or walmart, don't make sense in the context of the question, and the linen closet or closet aren't typically used for cleaning items like washcloths.
The use of the word "drinks" suggests that the context is related to alcohol consumption. Celebrating with excessive alcohol intake can often lead to getting drunk, which can have negative consequences such as impaired judgment, risk of accidents, and hangover. While the other options may be associated with celebrations, they are not directly related to the consequence of excessive drinking.
The sentence suggests that the balloon is capable of rising high, which is typically associated with reaching high altitude in the atmosphere. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. An aeroplane is not related to a balloon, the moon is far too high for a balloon to reach, and laboratory and chemistry lab are not related to the concept of a balloon rising.
The word "confetti" suggests that something needs to be cut into small pieces. A shredder is a common tool used to cut paper into small pieces, which is often used to make confetti. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the man is willing to face a difficult or unpleasant truth, which is often associated with being hurt. Enlightenment and satisfaction suggest a positive outcome, while happiness may not necessarily involve discovering the truth. Shock is also a possibility, but it is not as strong a suggestion as being hurt.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is bored and is seeking some form of entertainment. The security guard allows him to do something to pass the time, but the context of the sentence indicates that it is a relatively physical activity. "Grind" is a term commonly used in skateboarding when a skateboarder slides down a rail or edge of a surface. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "skateboard," as it is the only option that fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not involve physical activity, and some, like "meet interesting people" or "listen to music," are less likely to be allowed by a security guard in a particular environment.
The question is asking about a common behavior or action that kids need to do before they can go outside a house. Taking off shoes before entering a house is a common practice in many cultures, especially in Asian and Middle Eastern households. This is often done to keep the house clean and free from outside dirt and germs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Expressways are typically found in urban areas where there is a high volume of traffic and a need to move vehicles quickly through the city. This eliminates options such as medium and country, which do not have a large number of expressways. Eastern United States and Michigan are too broad and do not provide enough specific information to answer the question. Therefore, the correct answer is American city.
Zillow is a real estate website used by people who are looking to buy or rent a home. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a computer user using Zillow has the goal of finding a new place to live, which could include purchasing or renting a house or apartment. The other options, such as "hell" or "office building", do not align with the purpose of using a real estate website like Zillow.
The phrase "lots of people around you" suggests a social setting with a large crowd, which is commonly found at fairgrounds where people gather for fun, food, and games. The other options do not have any clear connection to a social setting with lots of people. "Good" is too vague without any context and "friend's house" may or may not have a large number of people depending on the situation. "Watching television" and "expensive" are unlikely to provide a social atmosphere with a large crowd.
The question is asking for a specific type of government system which consists of a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary democracy, and federation. Canada is an example of such a country, as it has a monarch as the head of state, a parliamentary system of government where members of parliament are elected by citizens, and also follows a federal system of government where power is divided between the central government and provincial governments. The other options do not relate to the specific government system mentioned in the question.
The question is asking for the body part that every person uses to talk. The mouth contains the tongue, teeth, and vocal cords that allow for speech production, making it the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
"Sparks fly" is a common metaphor used to describe a strong and immediate attraction between two people. In a machine shop, sparks are often produced during the process of cutting or welding metal, so the use of this metaphor would connect to the environment and suggest a strong and intense attraction. The other choices are not commonly associated with flirting or the context of a machine shop.
The sentence suggests that the mall is a part of a larger group of houses and businesses, which typically refers to suburban areas. Malls are commonly found in suburban areas where there is more space to build and where there is a larger population of potential shoppers. The other options do not fit this description as well.
The phrase "living on the streets" implies that the person is homeless and does not have a permanent residence. The other options do not accurately describe the situation of being homeless. The word "shameful" implies a sense of wrongdoing, which is not necessarily applicable to the situation of being homeless. "Ridiculous" and "lazy" are judgmental and insensitive terms that do not reflect the complex realities of homelessness. "Restricted" does not accurately describe the lack of a permanent home.
Brownstone is a type of sandstone that is commonly used in the construction of buildings in the Northeastern United States, particularly in areas such as Brooklyn, New York City. Therefore, the most likely answer is Brooklyn, as it is a borough of New York City and is known for its architecture featuring brownstone buildings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the horse escaped to a place where it could roam freely, which is commonly associated with the countryside. Horses are often kept in paddocks or stables in urban or suburban areas and may not have access to the open space and freedom they require. The other options are not as likely as countryside to provide the open space the horse needs.
The question implies that a woman wants to keep her sunglasses with her and not lose them. A purse is a commonly used accessory to carry personal items, including sunglasses. The other options (drugstore, movie theater, shirt pocket) are not appropriate places to store sunglasses as they do not offer protection or easy access. A bag could be a viable option but it is not clear what kind of bag is being referred to.
The question implies that learning about a complex and difficult subject could have a negative impact on someone. It's possible that the person could experience frustration or feel overwhelmed, but the most likely answer is a headache. Learning new information and processing complicated concepts can be mentally exhausting, which could lead to physical discomfort. The other options do not make logical sense as negative side effects of learning about a difficult subject.
The sentence suggests that the aging rockstar had to stop playing guitar due to a physical condition affecting their hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects joint mobility and could make it difficult for anyone, including a musician, to play an instrument. The other choices do not relate to a physical condition that would affect a musician's ability to play an instrument.
Jogging is a form of exercise that is generally associated with positive health benefits. It is common to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride after completing a jog, as it is a challenging physical activity that requires discipline and effort. The other options are all negative outcomes that are not typically associated with jogging, such as heart attacks and sore feet.
In the context of the question, the most likely place to find maps would be in a library. Libraries typically have a wide variety of books and resources, including maps, which can be borrowed or kept for reference. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question – guide drivers are unlikely to have extra maps to give away, bookstores may not have a large selection of maps, and cabinets and drawers are not typically associated with acquiring maps.
A performer typically stands on a stage during a performance, whether it is a play, musical, or dance. The other options, such as see saw and party, do not typically involve a performer standing or performing on something specific. Opera is also performed on a stage, but the question is asking about what a performer stands on, which is more closely associated with theater performances.
The sentence implies that there is a potential obstacle that could prevent someone from opening a business. The option "failure" is the most relevant choice as it directly relates to the potential risks and challenges of starting a business. The other options like "get rich" or "wealth" do not seem to fit in the context of the sentence because they suggest a motivation rather than an obstacle. The option "busy" is also unlikely to be the correct answer because being busy is not always a barrier to starting a business, and it does not necessarily stop someone from pursuing their goals.
When a car is left in the sun for an extended period of time, the interior of the car can become very hot due to the heat. This can cause the temperature to rise and make the interior uncomfortable for passengers to sit in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The words "light," "games," and "music" are often associated with carnivals, which are festive events that usually involve parades, amusement rides, and street performances. Concerts and discos may involve music and light, but they do not typically involve games. Planes are unrelated to celebrations and do not fit the context of the sentence. Christmas may involve lights and music, but it does not typically involve games in the way that carnivals do.
Enclosed markets are typically found in urban or city areas where there is limited space and a high concentration of people. In contrast, fields and rural areas are more likely to have open-air markets, and villages may have a mix of both. Mexico is a country and therefore is not a likely location for an enclosed market without specifying a city or region.
The word "procreating" is a euphemism for sexual activity, specifically reproduction. The sentence indicates that Sam enjoys a specific aspect of this activity, and the word "cum" refers to semen, which is typically associated with male pleasure during sexual activity. The other options may be associated with sexual activity, but they are not as directly related to male pleasure or reproduction as "cum."
The sentence suggests that listening to music while reading had a positive effect on John. It mentions that it helped him, so we can infer that it had a beneficial impact. The other options may have a negative or neutral impact on reading comprehension or enjoyment, but relaxation is commonly associated with reducing stress and increasing focus, which would support the idea that John found it easier to read while listening to music that helped him relax.
The sentence indicates that the fan has been watching the team play on Sundays, suggesting that the team likely plays a sport that is typically played on Sundays, such as football. The sentence also mentions the fan seeing a snap "live," which implies that they will be physically present at the game, ruling out options like a living room where they might watch a game on television. Finally, the phrase "enter a" suggests that they will be entering a specific space, further supporting the idea that the answer is a football stadium rather than a general location like a basketball court.
The question is asking for a location where a radio studio would not be found. An office building or college may have a radio studio as part of their communication or media departments. Broadcasting music could refer to a radio station, which would obviously have a radio studio. Large cities are likely to have multiple radio stations, each with their own studio. However, a clear area does not suggest any kind of building or infrastructure, making it the unlikely option where a radio studio could be found.
The sentence suggests that the round object is rolling down a ramp, and the question asks what will happen to it. One common physical phenomenon associated with a rolling object on a slope is that it gains speed as it moves downhill due to gravity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a rock hitting a windshield while on a highway, which suggests that the person was driving a land vehicle. "Motorboat" and "airplane" are water and air-based vehicles respectively, and "barrier" is not a type of vehicle at all. "Motor vehicle" is a more general term that could include automobiles, but "automobile" is the more specific and appropriate choice in this context.
The sentence indicates that the pool party was a way to "beat" something, suggesting that it was a solution to a problem. It then goes on to describe the party as a way to "entertain," implying that it was a social event. Together, these clues suggest that the problem being "beaten" is something related to discomfort or discomfort caused by heat. Therefore, the correct answer is "hot." The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that if the speaker goes outside and looks down, they are likely to see the ground. The other options (sun, sky, nature) are all located higher up in the sky and would not necessarily be visible by looking downwards. The option "street" could potentially be a correct answer if the speaker is standing on a street or sidewalk, but the phrasing of the sentence suggests that they are simply stepping outside and looking down.
The question is asking about what happens to your car when you're driving to work. Since driving requires fuel to power the engine, the most likely answer is "use gas." The other options don't necessarily relate to the act of driving, but rather the consequences of it (i.e. getting to work, feeling stressed, receiving a speeding ticket, or experiencing depreciation over time).
The sentence suggests that regular pants may not fit properly if a person is very something, and one of the choices that fits this context is "tall." Being tall means having a greater height than average, and this could result in pants being too short. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that Sally cannot return John's feelings, suggesting that she does not have romantic interest in him. "Disinterest" means a lack of interest or enthusiasm, which fits with Sally's feelings towards John. The other options, such as "being mean" or "negligence," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that John slept on a mat along with other children, implying that he is currently sleeping. The other options do not provide any relevant information about John's location or activity.
The sentence implies that the holy artifact is fragile and requires careful handling. The word "transporting" suggests that the object is being moved from one location to another, further emphasizing the importance of preventing any damage during the journey. The option "halibut" is completely unrelated and can be eliminated. While "profane" and "common" may be opposite in meaning to "holy," neither of them indicates that the object is fragile or requires careful handling. "Broken" is a possibility, but "damaged" is a more general term that covers a wider range of potential harm.
Tin is often used to package and store food items such as canned goods, which are commonly kept in cupboards or cabinets in the kitchen. The other options do not make sense for storing tin as they are not typically associated with food storage or packaging.
The sentence suggests that exercising is related to an activity that involves working on something. The use of the word "weights" implies that this is likely referring to weightlifting or strength training, which is a common way for people to exercise and work on building muscle. The other choices do not have any clear connection to exercise or physical activity.
The context of the sentence suggests that there is a concern about the fruit staying fresh in the heat. The most logical solution for this problem would be to put the fruit in a place where it can remain cool and preserved, such as a refrigerator. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
It is customary to serve eggs on a plate for human consumption. The other options, such as a chicken coop or bird's nest, are not realistic choices for serving eggs to people. While a henhouse is where chickens live, it is not where one would serve food to someone. A glass cup is not a suitable dish for serving eggs, unless perhaps they are going to be used in a mixed drink or cocktail.
The phrase "closing sales" suggests that the stores are going out of business, implying that they have had financial difficulties. Department stores are large, multi-purpose retailers that sell a variety of products, which may explain why they are more likely to have higher overhead costs than smaller stores like clothing or grocery stores. Additionally, department stores have been struggling to compete with online retailers in recent years, which may be another reason why many of them have been closing. The other options do not provide any relevant information to support their selection.
The question is asking where you can acquire a French horn to take home, which suggests that the answer must relate to purchasing or borrowing the instrument. Of the options given, the only one that could reasonably involve buying or renting a French horn is a music store. The other options all relate to attending events or classes, which is not necessarily related to acquiring an instrument. Also, the option 'France' is misleading because it states the name of the country as an option, whereas the correct answer would be a store in France.
The question asks for something that can be found in a bookstore that is not for sale. Magazines and phone books are both items that are typically sold in bookstores, and carpeting is not typically found in a bookstore. Towns and cities, however, can often be the subject matter of books or may be referenced in books without being tangible items that can be sold. Therefore, town is the correct answer.
The sentence indicates that the roommates are young and irresponsible, which suggests that they may not have good cleaning habits or keep a tidy living space. An apartment is a common living space for roommates, and the other options such as table, office, desk, and closet do not have the same connotation of being a shared residential space that is prone to becoming messy.
The question is asking about the consequences of being caught as a criminal. "Serving time" refers to the punishment of being sentenced to a certain amount of time in jail or prison. The other options do not make sense in this context - a criminal would not feel happy about being caught or take money (which would be considered theft) and arming themselves would only lead to further trouble with the law. "Realising error of ways" is a possible answer, but it is not a specific consequence that is always associated with being caught as a criminal.
Overeating generally leads to an increase in calorie intake, which can cause a person to gain weight over time. Hamburger, being a high-calorie food, when overeaten, can cause a significant weight gain. A stomach ache is a more immediate consequence that may occur after eating a lot of hamburger, but it is not necessarily a long-term consequence. Getting full is a normal response to eating and is not negative. Losing weight is the opposite of the expected consequence of overeating hamburger. Death is an extreme consequence that is not relevant to the context of the question.
The word "checkup for followup" suggests that this is a medical appointment that is occurring after something else, likely a previous checkup or medical event. The word "uncertainty" suggests that there is still some question or concern that needs to be addressed, which is why the person is having a follow-up checkup. The other options do not necessarily indicate a reason for a checkup for follow-up, as they could apply to a range of different medical situations.
In the United States, it is illegal to purchase beer if you are under the age of 21. Therefore, proof of age is required to purchase beer, which is typically in the form of a government-issued ID such as a driver's license or passport. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the construction of a new entertainment complex was going to have a negative impact on the budget. The use of the word "costs" implies that expenses related to the project were increasing or adding up, which is supported by the use of the word "but." The other options do not accurately reflect the situation presented in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Grumpy is grooming himself because he wants to improve his appearance. The phrase "looking pretty" directly refers to appearance and is the most appropriate choice among the options given. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or have any association with improving one's appearance.
The context of the question is related to groceries, which implies that the vehicle would be used to transport them. The word "carry" is the closest in meaning to transporting or moving something from one place to another, which would be the primary function of a vehicle in this context. The other options do not make sense in relation to groceries, as they either involve physical actions that cannot be performed by a vehicle (eating), or negative outcomes that would not be desirable (feeling the impact of an accident, slowing down).
The sentence suggests that the dog lived with a woman, which indicates that the dog was a pet and likely lived in the woman's house rather than a dog house. The option "basket" may seem like a possible answer, but it is unlikely that a dog would live permanently in a basket. Canada and Illinois are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The word "maintopmast" refers to a specific part of a sailing ship and has no connection to the context of a video. The other options all relate to aspects of a video that may not be the primary focus, such as characters who have smaller roles or elements that are considered secondary or peripheral to the main story or action.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is having a hard time getting started on her work, which is often connected to lacking momentum. Momentum is a force that helps us move forward with a consistent pace, and when we lack it, we may experience difficulties or have a hard time starting. Panic, excitement, and accomplishment all suggest different emotional states that are not directly related to the idea of struggling to begin work, while computer is not connected to the context of the sentence.
Wheat fields are commonly found in rural or agricultural areas, and the term "countryside" specifically refers to areas outside of cities and towns that are characterized by open fields and natural landscapes. "Mill" and "bread" are related to wheat, but do not necessarily indicate an area in which wheat fields are concentrated. "Eat cake" is unrelated and "farmer's field" is too general to infer a specific crop or location.
The context of the sentence suggests that Boris is being dishonest with Natasha about how she looks in the dress. The phrase "but look far" is likely a typo and should read "butt look fat." Given Boris's dishonesty and desire to avoid something, it is likely that he is afraid of being found out or caught in his lie. The other options (being fired, trouble, hurt feelings, overweight) do not make sense in this context.
The use of a compass to draw a ball suggests that the drawing would have a precise and symmetrical shape. The term "spherical" specifically refers to a three-dimensional object that is perfectly round, which would best describe a ball that has been accurately drawn using a compass. The other options ("continuous motion", "rolling down street", "circular", and "round") do not accurately describe the shape of a drawn ball, as they lack the precision and accuracy that would result from using a compass.
A well-stocked aisle is most commonly associated with a store or supermarket that sells goods. The other options, such as a church, car wash or sanctuary, do not have aisles that would typically be referred to as "well-stocked". A building is a general term that could refer to any type of structure and does not provide enough context to determine where well-stocked aisles might be found.
The sentence implies that small pats of butter are commonly found in a specific location, suggesting that it is a common item in that context. While butter can certainly be found in refrigerators, pastry, and fridges, these options do not specify the size or form of the butter, making them less likely to be the correct answer. The inclusion of "inside a mammoth's handbag" is clearly a joke and can be eliminated as an option. The most appropriate answer is thus "restaurant," where small pats of butter are often provided with bread or other dishes.
The sentence implies that the man wanted to listen to the radio, which suggests that it was initially turned off. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn on." The other options (play music, train, blaring, radiotracking) do not accurately describe what the man did to the radio to be able to listen to it.
The sentence indicates that this is the person's first job, which suggests that they may be experiencing feelings of excitement and anticipation. Starting a new job can be a significant and positive milestone in someone's life, so it's more likely that he is excited rather than feeling panic, stress, or simply resting. The option "working" is not a feeling, but rather an action that will come after starting the job.
The sentence suggests that there is a reason why children enjoy jumping rope, which is unlikely to be related to physiological processes such as an increased heart rate or sweating. While those physical effects may be caused by jumping rope, they are not likely to be the primary motivator for why children enjoy the activity. "Smiling" is a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to explain why children enjoy jumping rope. Therefore, "having fun" is the best answer because it directly relates to the enjoyment that children experience from this activity.
The word "look forward to" suggests a positive outcome, and the context of opening a business implies that the goal is to be successful. Opening a business is often associated with hopes and aspirations for success, rather than stress, failure, or bankruptcy. "Cash" could be a factor in success, but it is not the ultimate goal.
The other options, such as stealing a flute or finding one in a marching band, are not ethical or practical ways to obtain a flute. Orchestras and symphonies may have flutes, but they are typically reserved for members of the ensemble. A musical instrument store, on the other hand, is a place where one can buy or rent a variety of musical instruments, including flutes. Therefore, the correct answer is musical instrument store.
The word "killing" suggests intentional and unjustified taking of a human life, which is categorized as murder. The reason why people commit this crime varies from person to person, but one common motivation for murder is hate or anger towards the victim. The other options, such as sporting events or feeling remorse, do not align with the severity and intentionality of murder.
Eating an unhealthy meal typically means consuming a high number of calories, sugar, and/or unhealthy fats. This excess intake can cause the body to store the extra energy as fat, leading to weight gain over time. Gas, indigestion, and getting full are all possible side effects of eating a large meal, but they are not directly related to weight gain. Electrical circuit is not relevant to the context of the question.
The word "retribution" refers to punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act. In this context, it suggests that the person committed the killing as a form of revenge or retaliation for something that was done to them, making it the most likely answer. "Investigation," "disease," and "going to jail" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "punishment" is a possibility but not as specific as "retribution."
The sentence mentions an examination table, which is typically found in a medical setting. The fact that Bobby is happy this is a simple procedure and that he doesn't have to stay overnight suggests that it's a routine medical check-up or appointment, rather than an emergency or serious illness. The hospital and vet's office options might be plausible, but the language of the sentence suggests a human patient rather than an animal. The school and obituary options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a difference in behavior between happy and unhappy couples when it comes to a certain activity. The answer choice "have sex" is the only one that directly relates to this activity, and it makes sense that happy couples would engage in it more often than unhappy couples. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Sally was attempting to communicate using a device that required knowledge of morse code. A walkie talkie is a two-way radio that does not require knowledge of morse code to use. The other options, such as telegram, telegraph, organ, and motor do not involve communication through verbal or textual means, nor do they require knowledge of morse code.
The sentence indicates that Brian was a soldier and has received the news that he was called back to active service, meaning he would have to report for duty soon. The other options may be related to being a soldier, but they do not accurately reflect the immediate action that Brian would need to take upon being called back to active service.
The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to shopping or carrying items in a bag. A grocery store is a common place to use a paper bag for carrying purchases, while a synagogue, classroom, lunchbox, and front porch are not typically associated with this activity.
The sentence suggests that when two people have differing viewpoints, it can lead to a negative effect on their relationship. The word "tension" is often used to describe an uncomfortable or strained atmosphere between people. The other options, such as enemies or battle, suggest a more extreme or aggressive outcome, which may not be the case in all situations.
The sentence implies that the man is looking for a specific type of bowl for cereal, indicating that he may want a quality product that can hold his cereal without spilling. China shops typically sell high-quality dishes, including bowls that could be used for cereal. The kitchen cabinet and cupboard options would involve looking for a bowl within his home, which may not be a viable option if he does not already have a spare bowl. The cereal box option is not logical since it contains cereal, not a bowl.
The sentence suggests that the person is thirsty and wants to drink some coffee. To consume a liquid, most people would use a cup, which is a vessel designed to hold liquids. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker went to a party at a friend's house, which implies a more casual setting than a restaurant or mall counter. Additionally, sharing a meal typically takes place in a designated eating area, such as a dining room, rather than a shopping area or big city.
The sentence suggests that James enjoys going down, which implies that he doesn't enjoy going up. This eliminates options such as loss of oxygen, blisters, and vertigo, which are all physical ailments that can occur during climbing regardless of which direction one is going. Getting a snack is also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be ascending, which is the direct opposite of going down.
The phrase "agreeing with each other" suggests that the people in question are in a state of agreement or accord. The word "harmony" also means a state of agreement or congruity, so it is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not necessarily indicate agreement, such as "rapport" which refers to a positive interpersonal relationship and "band together" which means to unite for a common purpose. "Smiles" could suggest agreement but it is not a defining characteristic, while "tears" suggests the opposite of agreement.
The sentence suggests that birds are located on a "statute," which is likely a typo for "statue." Birds are not typically found on statues that are located in the countryside or in city hall buildings. Parks do have statues and may have birds, but the sentence specifically asks where birds are on a statue, not in a park. The only logical option left is "air," which is where birds can fly and perch on statues.
Explosive devices are commonly used in construction sites for building and demolishing structures. They are particularly useful in cases where traditional demolition methods may not be practical due to safety or space constraints. While bombs and explosives are also associated with the military and war, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on their use in a non-violent setting. The options "army" and "war" are therefore less likely to be correct. "Workplace" could be a possible answer, but it is more general and does not specifically relate to the use of explosive devices.
The sentence suggests that the hamburger patties were frozen from being exposed to some external factor. Given that the other options (except for "made from beef") describe potential locations where one might eat a hamburger, it is most likely that the exposure occurred at a fast food restaurant. These types of establishments often prepare and freeze their hamburger patties in advance, increasing the likelihood of them becoming frozen due to overexposure.
The word "tragedy" implies that something bad happened, and the use of the word "remembering" suggests that it occurred in the past. "Pain" is a common emotion that people feel when reflecting on difficult or traumatic events, while "depression" may suggest a longer-term mood disorder rather than a natural response to a specific event. "Nostalgia" and "knowing" are not necessarily associated with negative experiences or emotions.
The sentence implies that a child requires the presence of someone to take care of them, suggesting that the answer is a person or group of people. The most common caregivers for a child are typically their parents, as they are responsible for nurturing and supporting their child's growth and development. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not describe a caregiver role.
The sentence suggests that a small dog needs to relieve itself, which would typically require going outside. Dogs are commonly trained to do their business outside, either in a backyard or on a walk. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that driving is a common way for people to move from one place to another, which is a characteristic commonly associated with transportation. Traffic jams and accidents may be negative aspects of driving, but they do not describe the purpose or function of driving. Moving may involve a variety of methods, such as walking, using public transportation, or hiring a moving company, so it does not accurately reflect the popularity of driving as a personal mode of transportation. Status may be a reason why some people choose to drive, but it is not the most widely recognized aspect of personal transportation.
The sentence implies that squirrels can be found in abundance outside of cities, and specifically mentions a location where they can be found. Parks are common areas where wildlife can be found, including squirrels. Forests can also be home to many animals, but the sentence specifies "outside of the city," which suggests a more urban location like a park. Yards may have squirrels but not in great numbers and only in residential areas. Streets and deserts are unlikely places to find squirrels.
The use of the word "let" indicates that the woman allowed her son to play with something in his room, so options like prohibit and disallow can be eliminated as they suggest the opposite action of not allowing something. Annoy is a possibility, but it doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence. Stop is also a possibility, but it doesn't convey the sense of disallowing something that forbid does. Therefore, forbid is the best choice.
The term "weasel" is often used to describe a sneaky or devious person, so it's unlikely that a human Weasel would be found in a government building or a children's song. A "chicken coop" seems too specific for a human to be hiding in, and "Congress" is too vague. "Outside" is the most general option and could encompass a wide variety of locations where a person might try to hide or be sneaky.
The word "cozy" suggests a comfortable, warm, and intimate environment, which is typically associated with one's own house. Eating in one's own house can provide a sense of familiarity and relaxation that may not be found in a public space like downtown, prison, or city. The inclusion of "earing" is likely a typo and does not make sense in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Picnic baskets are often associated with carrying food and drinks for outdoor activities, making it the most likely option. A wine press is used for making wine and a box is too general without any specific details about what the grapes are for. The fruit cocktail and kitchen options are also not related to carrying a bunch of grapes.
The sentence suggests that the car was experiencing mechanical issues, specifically overheating. The fact that it was located on a street corner implies that it had likely broken down and was unable to continue driving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that riding a bike along the pathway on the beach brought a positive experience. The words "peacefully cruising along" also indicate a calm and enjoyable activity. The options "falling down" and "anger" suggest negative experiences, while "get somewhere" implies a utilitarian purpose rather than a leisurely activity. "Pleasure" is similar to "enjoyment" but not as specific to the context of the sentence. Therefore, "enjoyment" is the best answer.
The sentence suggests that there is a magical kingdom that becomes miserable when it rains, which is a clue to the answer. Disneyland is a well-known theme park that is often associated with magic and whimsy, and it is located in Southern California, where it rarely rains. When it does rain, the park may not be as enjoyable due to the outdoor nature of many of the attractions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the monger removed a bone in preparation for serving something. Out of the given choices, only fresh fish is a common food that would require the removal of bones. Octopus is typically served whole or in large pieces, and would not require bone removal. Skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth are all inappropriate choices for food.
The context of the sentence suggests that expressing oneself in a public forum may lead to a negative experience. "Danger" and "getting arrested" seem unlikely if the expression is lawful and respectful. "Blank stares" may be a possibility, but is not a negative outcome. "Stage fright" is a possibility, but does not necessarily involve expressing oneself in a negative light. "Embarrassment," however, is a common negative experience that may arise from expressing oneself in a way that is not well received by the public.
The sentence implies that running after balls has a positive effect on one's body. "Fitness" is a commonly associated benefit with physical activity, such as running, while "sweating" and "physical exertion" are outcomes of the activity rather than benefits. "Catching up with" and "sprinting" are more specific actions rather than general outcomes.
The sentence suggests that James was trying to cool off on a hot summer day, which is often done for the purpose of relaxation. Swimming or sitting in a pool can help to reduce body temperature and provide a break from the heat, which may explain why James was doing it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions "throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects," which is a clear reference to the sport of bowling. Bowling alleys are specifically designed for this sport, and they often have bars or restaurants where patrons can enjoy a beer while playing. The other options, such as a hockey game or croquet, do not involve throwing heavy spheres or white objects, and the option of a fridge does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A sporting goods store is a typical place to purchase a baseball. The other options, such as America, a park, a sandbox, or breaking a window, do not make sense in this context as they do not relate to how to acquire a baseball.
The phrase "torn to shreds" refers to a destructive force that has the ability to break down a large object into many small pieces. Additionally, the phrase "one projectile after another flying through the air" suggests a swirling motion that is typical of a tornado. A tornado is a powerful and destructive weather phenomenon that can easily tear through buildings and cause debris to fly through the air. The other options, such as "weapon," "baseball," "air," and "cannon," do not fit the context and would not be able to explain the destructive force described in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person found the math class to be uninteresting, which suggests that they were seeking something else from the class besides a basic level of understanding. The option "intellectual stimulation" is directly related to the sentence, as it suggests that the person wanted to be intellectually engaged by the class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally took a break from hard work by going on vacation and doing an activity that involves building. Sand castles are typically constructed and built, which makes "construct" the most appropriate option. "Faster" and "working" do not make sense in the context of building a sand castle, while "piece together" and "put together" imply that the castle was already in some state of completion before Sally began her activity, which is not indicated in the sentence.
The question asks for a characteristic of a healthy person, which suggests traits or behaviors that contribute to physical or mental well-being. While none of the options are inherently incorrect or impossible, the most likely choice is "new experiences," as engaging in novel, stimulating activities has been linked to positive mood, improved cognitive functioning, and other markers of health. Depression, on the other hand, is a mental health issue that indicates the opposite of a desirable characteristic. Owning a house or being good looking are not necessarily indicative of overall health, while playfulness may be a positive trait, but not necessarily a core characteristic of health.
The sentence suggests that Mary's animal friend needs to be on a leash when doing a certain activity. The only choice that fits this context is "leave home," as animals on leashes are often taken outside of the house for walks or other outings. The other options are not related to the concept of leash-walking.
The word "grumpy" suggests that this cat would prefer a comfortable, cozy spot to curl up and be left alone. A warm bed is a common place for cats to nap, and the word "warm" implies that it is a comfortable spot. The other options, such as a sandbox or a shelf, do not suggest a comfortable or cozy environment for a grumpy cat.
The sentence suggests that the farmer needed dental treatment, which is typically provided in a hospital or dental clinic setting. The other options - michigan, pub, town, and street - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Blood travels throughout the body via a network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries. Capillaries are the smallest of these vessels, and they are responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues and organs. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that Simon brought his computer to his living space, as he mentioned going up the stairs and setting it up by the sofa. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, such as a classroom, park, school, or demonstration.
Becoming inebriated often refers to becoming drunk, which can impair judgment, coordination, and impulse control. This can lead to aggressive, harmful, or reckless behavior, such as getting into fights. Addiction, arrest, and paralysis are less common outcomes of becoming inebriated. Staggering may occur as a physical symptom of intoxication, but it is not a consequence that someone would "get into."
The sentence suggests that the newspaper boy needs to protect the paper from the rain. The best option for this would be to place the paper on the roof of the recipient's home, where it would be protected from the rain. The other options, such as the library or the lawn, do not provide any clear protection from the rain. The trash also does not make sense, as it suggests that the newspaper should be thrown away in the rain. The front door could provide some protection, but placing the paper on the roof would be the most effective option.
The sentence implies that the group is actively working towards changing society in a significant way, which is a definition commonly associated with social activism. Social activism involves engaging in actions or campaigns that aim to influence social or political change. Voting and arguing alone may not necessarily lead to radical societal change, while dancers are not relevant to the question and social disruption has a negative connotation.
The sentence indicates that the space being described has room for multiple bedrooms, an office, a study, and a playroom. This suggests that it is a large and spacious living area, as a small house would not have enough room for all of these separate areas. Building is too vague, and nursery school and preschool are not consistent with the context provided.
Frying pans are often used in cooking and can become very hot, which is why they typically have a handle to make them easier to hold and maneuver while cooking. The other options, such as carrying things, a coffee cup, an iron, or a briefcase, do not typically have hot handles.
The sentence suggests that the person being rescued is behaving aggressively towards the paramedics. In this situation, the paramedics may need to defend themselves, and unfortunately, that may involve "hurting" the person in order to protect themselves and complete the rescue. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the paramedics' need to protect themselves.
The sentence suggests that the person is thinking about the pros and cons of extra responsibilities and benefits that come with a certain achievement or change in their career. Given the context, the most likely choice is promotion. Driving to work suggests that the person is employed and looking to advance in their career. The other choices don't make sense in this context.
The phrase "wet match" suggests that the match is damp or moist, which means that it will not light easily. This is because the moisture can prevent the match from igniting, and can also put out the flame if the match does light. Therefore, attempting to light a wet match is more likely to result in frustration rather than any of the other options suggested.
The sentence implies that there is one specific action that is considered the "worst thing" to do while driving. From a safety perspective, dozing off or falling asleep while driving is extremely dangerous and can result in serious accidents. The other options such as "getting somewhere" or "using gas" are not inherently dangerous while driving, while "listening to others" is not specific enough to the context and "speeding ticket" refers to a consequence of bad driving, rather than the action itself.
The question is asking about the best place to store shoes, which suggests that the answer should be a location where shoes can be organized and kept out of the way when not in use. A closet is a common location for storing shoes as it allows for easy organization and access, while keeping them hidden away from the rest of the living space. The other options do not provide an adequate solution for shoe storage.
The sentence suggests that James needs a new hammer, which is a common tool found in hardware stores. Hardware stores typically carry a wide range of tools, including hammers, and are a common place to buy tools for household or DIY projects. While a repair shop or tool shop could potentially have hammers, they are not as commonly associated with selling these types of tools. A carpenter's toolbox or personal tool box may not have a new hammer readily available, as these are typically stored with the owner's personal tools.
The question is asking about the result of getting a blackout from amnesia, which suggests a loss of memory. Amnesia is a condition where a person experiences memory loss, which could result in a blackout. The other options do not relate to the concept of memory loss, making them incorrect choices.
A screw is a small, metal fastener commonly used in woodworking. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the missing screw would be found in a place where woodworking tools and materials are stored. The tool box is a common storage location for screws, while the other options have no connection to woodworking or screws.
The sentence suggests that the woman did not fulfill her dream of owning a house in the countryside and instead settled for a cramped apartment. The word "city" provides a clear contrast to the dream of living in the countryside, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. "Street" and "residential area" could refer to a variety of locations, while "ghetto" and "subdivision" have negative and positive connotations respectively, which are not implied in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the people were having difficulty understanding the words being spoken, which implies that the words were not clear or were not presented in a comprehensible manner. This rules out options such as "hurt people" and "hurtful," which suggest a negative or harmful intent behind the words. "Mean many things" also does not fit the context, as it suggests a broad range of interpretations rather than confusion. "Hurt feelings" is close in meaning to "unclear," but the latter is a more accurate descriptor of the situation presented.
The word "predicament" suggests a difficult or challenging situation, in which an animal might need to protect itself. The option "fight for life" is the most appropriate response, as it implies that the animal is facing a life-threatening situation and might need to use aggression to protect itself. The other options do not necessarily relate to survival in a dangerous circumstance.
Peanut butter is commonly sold in jars, which are typically made of glass or plastic and have a screw-on lid for easy opening and closing. The other options, such as cupboard and pantry, are places where you might store peanut butter once it's been opened and transferred to a different container. A bottle would be an unusual choice for peanut butter packaging, and supermarkets are places where you can buy peanut butter, but they are not the specific container that it comes in.
The sentence suggests that despite a desire for peace, there were difficulties in rebuilding and a sense of instability or upheaval. Turmoil means a state of great disturbance, confusion or uncertainty, and is a suitable word to describe the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sense of unrest and uncertainty conveyed by the context of the sentence.
The question asks about what cats could do if they were taller. Cats, being intelligent creatures, might be able to do certain things if they were tall enough to reach or grasp objects that they cannot currently reach, such as opening doors. The other choices - annoy, eat meat, need food, and jog - either do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or have no direct relation to a cat's ability to be taller.
The sentence implies that the snake was seeking cover from predators that may be above ground, which suggests that it was seeking shelter under some sort of overhead cover. A wooded area would provide ample opportunity for the snake to seek shelter under branches and leaves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as a tropical forest or warm place may not provide enough overhead cover and a canyon or sleeping bag do not seem like feasible options for a snake seeking cover.
The other options are not likely to contribute to someone being a good teacher. Teaching to the test may help students perform well on exams, but it does not necessarily foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Vacations are important for rest and rejuvenation, but they do not directly impact teaching ability. Interested students may be easier to teach, but it does not guarantee that the teacher is effective. Students learning is the goal of teaching, not a factor that contributes to being a good teacher.
Hermit crabs are commonly sold as pets in pet shops, making this the most likely answer. Fishmongers sell fish, not hermit crabs, and the intertidal zone and tidepools are natural habitats where hermit crabs might be found but not taken home. The ocean is too vast to pinpoint a specific location to take home a hermit crab.
The sentence implies that the subject is showing respect for another person, and the question is asking what action they could take to demonstrate that respect. Out of the given choices, the most appropriate response would be to give them a gift as a token of appreciation. The other options (slight, irreverence, disregard, and belittlement) would be disrespectful and inappropriate.
Getting wet can lower the body temperature and weaken the immune system, making it more susceptible to catching a cold or other respiratory infections. Skin rash and dilution are not common results of getting wet, while melting is an absurd option. Feeling cold is a natural response to being wet but it is not necessarily a consequence of it.
Alcohol consumption can impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading individuals to make choices they may not make if they were sober. This can include choosing to engage in sexual activity with someone they may not typically find attractive or approve of. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for this behavior, and may not be related to alcohol consumption.
The sentence implies that the previous facility had staff who were not attentive to the needs of the elderly residents, as evidenced by their lethargic behavior. The word "indifferent" means lacking in interest or concern, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "neglect" and "disregard," imply intentional harm or neglect, which is not suggested by the sentence. "Manual" does not make sense in the context of staffing for an elderly care facility.
The sentence suggests that the people with chocolate in their pockets will do something as a result. The word "act" is the most logical option because it is the most general and could encompass any action that a person might take after finding chocolate in their pocket. The other options (transcend reality, read newspapers, experience spirituality, and melt) do not make sense in this context and do not seem related to the idea of having chocolate in one's pockets.
The sentence suggests that doing housework all day is likely to result in a physical feeling. The options "boredom" and "getting a clean house" are not physical feelings, while "backache" may be a result of lifting or strenuous activity during housework, but it is not the most likely outcome. "Tiredness" and "getting tired" are similar options, but "tiredness" is a more definitive response as it describes a feeling of exhaustion or fatigue that comes from extended physical activity.
The sentence suggests that Jenny does not like children, which may indicate that she is annoyed or bothered by their behavior. Yelling, annoying, and noisy are all negative behaviors that children may exhibit that could exacerbate Jenny's feelings toward them. Curious and innocent are neutral or positive traits that may not necessarily impact Jenny's dislike of children.
The question suggests that the meat is not going to be used immediately and needs to be stored properly to prevent spoilage. Freezing is an option for long-term storage, but the question specifies that it needs to be used soon, so the freezer is not the best answer. Butcher shop and frying pan are not options for storing meat. The counter is not a good choice either, as it can lead to bacterial growth if the meat is left at room temperature for too long. The fridge is the most appropriate answer for storing meat that needs to be used soon, as it will slow down bacterial growth and keep the meat fresh for a few more days.
The word "rubber" in this context refers to a condom, which is a form of contraception used during sexual activity. Condoms are typically sold in drug stores, as well as other places like supermarkets, convenience stores, and health clinics. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James tripped over something in the house, which implies that the toys were on the floor where he was running. Additionally, his mother had warned him to put his toys away, indicating that they were likely scattered on the floor rather than neatly stored in a drawer or a basement. The options "slippery" and "store" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the location of a knight in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, rather than a literal one. In this case, a knight is most commonly associated with the game of chess, where it is one of the playing pieces. The other options, such as middle ages, historical novel, castle, and guarding the king, do not fit the context of the sentence as they all refer to literal locations or historical periods.
The phrase "large fluffy clouds" suggests that the clouds have a visually pleasing and impressive appearance which can often evoke feelings of wonder or amazement in people who observe them. The option "blanket" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, "cause rain to fall" and "bring rain" suggests that the clouds are responsible for precipitation which is not mentioned in the sentence, and "rain water" is not a suggested effect of observing the clouds.
The sentence indicates that the woman completed her errands right away, suggesting that she has a preference for efficiency and productivity. The phrase "get things done" directly relates to this idea of being productive and completing tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person forgot to put a lid on a container, likely a garbage can, and that raccoons were able to knock all of the garbage out. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Composted" implies that the garbage was being turned into compost, which is not mentioned. "Nice aroma" suggests the garbage smelled good, which is not the case in the sentence. "Smell terrible" and "smells bad" describe the smell of the garbage, but do not indicate what the raccoons knocked it out of.
The sentence suggests that the person was worried about performing, which is commonly associated with anxiety. Anxiety can be characterized by feelings of worry, nervousness, or unease about an upcoming event, which is consistent with the context of the sentence. The other options such as injury, action, lightning or fear do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "meet" suggests that the animals are encountering each other for the first time, and given the range of options, it is likely that there will be some sort of interaction or reaction. "Procreate" would only occur if the animals were of the opposite sex and willing to mate. "Sleep" and "live lives" are too general and could happen regardless of whether animals meet or not. "Listen to each other" might occur in some cases, but it is less likely than animals fighting each other to establish dominance.
The sentence suggests that the judge was doing his job on his bench, and the most important principle related to his job would be the idea of being fair. Being fair is a foundational principle of serving justice, thus marking it as the most important principle. The other options - honest, lawyer, arranging files, and telling the truth - do not relate directly to the idea of serving justice, and hence do not qualify as the answer.
A story in print can refer to a work of fiction or non-fiction that is published in a physical format such as a book or a magazine. Bookstores are a common place to find books, while schools may have textbooks or novels for students to read. Newspapers typically contain news articles and not fiction or longer-form stories. The option "past" does not make sense in this context as it is not a physical location or item where stories can be found.
Eating is usually done to satisfy hunger and provide the body with necessary nutrients to maintain health. The other options, such as dyspepsia and indigestion, are negative outcomes from overeating or eating unhealthy foods. To gloat does not relate to the act of eating, and gaining weight may be a consequence of frequent overeating but is not a reason someone would want to eat.
The sentence suggests that the learner is looking for a formal setting to learn how to play a french horn. While one could potentially find resources and guidance in other settings, such as a music store or concert hall, a music class is a dedicated space for learning and instruction. France may be associated with the instrument due to its name, but it is not a relevant answer for where to learn how to play it. On top of a mountain is clearly an absurd choice and can be eliminated.
The sentence mentions the half court boundary and 3 pointers, which are specific to the game of basketball. The other options have no relation to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that sugar is a main ingredient, which implies that it is being used as a sweetener in a food or beverage. Candy bars and tea often contain sugar, but water is not a typical ingredient in either. Coffee may be sweetened with sugar, but it is not a main ingredient. Cupboard is not a food or beverage, so it can be eliminated as an option. Therefore, soda pop, which is known to contain high amounts of sugar, is the most likely answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a place where they can fire up a grill, which is typically done outdoors. The options "restaurant" and "kitchen" do not make sense in this context, as those are indoor spaces where grilling would not typically occur. "Park" could be a possible option, but the use of the word "out" suggests that the speaker is already outside, so they would not need to go to a park to grill. Therefore, the best answer would be "backyard," which is a common outdoor space for grilling.
The sentence suggests that Steve asked people for a place to stay, which implies that he is likely staying with someone he knows. The options "apartment" and "tent" do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply that Steve found a place to stay on his own. The option "outside" is unlikely because it suggests Steve would be sleeping outdoors, which is not a common or safe option. The option "living room" is a possibility, but the most likely answer is "friend's house" since it is common for people to offer a spare room or couch to a friend in need.
The sentence suggests that the man's goal was to completely destroy the town, which is often a tactic used in war to weaken the enemy. In this context, "reducing to rubble" means destroying completely. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not align with the man's actions of hate and destruction.
The sentence suggests that a child is learning a specific skill related to a lake. The option "row boat" is the most specific skill related to being on a lake, as it involves using oars to move a small boat through the water. The other options, such as becoming an adult, starting school, or driving, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Go out to play" is a more general option that could fit, but it is not as specific as "row boat."
The context suggests that David had the map with him at some point but cannot recall where he put it. The last time he remembers having it was at a rest stop where he had also taken out his toothbrush. Therefore, it is likely that the map is still at the rest area where he had stopped to brush his teeth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Chess boards are typically kept in a cabinet when not in use to protect the pieces and keep them organized. Keeping a chess board in a house is too general and does not specify where in the house it would be kept. Likewise, keeping it in a basement or retirement community is not specific enough or applicable to all situations. Keeping it in a toy store does not make sense as it is not a place where one would typically keep personal items.
The sentence suggests that the event being described involves a performance at a theater, likely a play or musical. The phrase "part way through" suggests that the performance was interrupted temporarily. An intermission is a common pause in live performances that allows the audience to take a break, use the restroom, and purchase refreshments. "Spending money" and "being entertained" are too vague and do not relate directly to the context of the sentence. "Sleepiness" is unrelated and "man of la mancha" is a specific reference that does not fit the sentence.
A small folding knife is often carried in a pocket for convenience and easy access. The other options do not make sense in the context of carrying a knife, as they are not locations where a knife would typically be stored or used. A kitchen drawer might contain a larger knife used for cooking, a fishing boat might have specialized knives for cleaning fish, and a garbage bag and table are not relevant to the question.
A library is a common place to find newspapers, especially if you are looking for a specific title. Many libraries keep archives of newspapers on microfilm or in digital format, and they may also have physical copies available for borrowing or viewing within the library. Magazine articles and archives may contain information about the newspaper, but they are not a direct source for obtaining a specific title. Safe deposit boxes are typically used for storing valuable items such as jewelry or important documents, and a page is a part of a book or document, not a location for obtaining a newspaper.
The sentence suggests that the question is not about finding an actual star in the sky, but rather a celebrity that is famous and well-known. Since the other options do not have any relevance to the world of entertainment or celebrities, the answer must be "hollywood" which is a famous location known for being the center of the movie industry and the place where many celebrities live and work.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is in an unfamiliar kitchen and needs to ask for the location of spoons, which implies that they are in a place where they do not usually go. Fraternity houses and restaurants may not be places where the speaker has access to the kitchen or utensils, making them less likely options. While it is possible that the speaker could be in a restaurant, the use of the word "informally" suggests a casual setting, making a friend's house, neighbor's house, or grandmas house more likely.
The sentence suggests that a bald eagle might be spotted soaring in clear skies. Bald eagles are known to inhabit mountainous areas with clear skies, such as the Rocky Mountains. They are also commonly associated with Washington, as it is the state bird and can often be seen soaring over the state's forests and waterways. The other options, such as a nature preserve, soup, and Colorado, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Procreation refers specifically to the act of animals (and humans) reproducing and producing offspring. The other options do not accurately describe the process of reproduction or are unrelated to the question. "Birth" involves the delivery of offspring, rather than the act of producing them. "Reproduce asexually" refers to a type of reproduction that does not involve the combination of genetic material from two parents. "Lie down" and "feel pain" do not have any connection to reproduction.
Petrol is commonly used as fuel for engines, whether in cars, boats, or other machinery. The phrase "power engines" specifically refers to the use of petrol as a fuel source for engines. Gas stations are places where petrol can be purchased, but they do not use petrol to power anything themselves. "Burn hot" is not a common usage for petrol and does not fit the context of the question. Fuel tanks are containers for holding petrol, but they do not use petrol to power anything. While cars do run on petrol, the question is asking about what petrol is used to power, not what runs on petrol.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was feeling down and their friends threw them a party to help cheer them up. The phrase "make happy" directly relates to this situation, as it implies that the friends were trying to improve the speaker's mood. Reciprocity, getting drunk, and embarrassing oneself do not fit the context of the sentence. Making money is also unlikely as a motive for this kind of gesture.
The sentence implies that Sam was not in a hurry while shopping, which allowed him to be more mindful. Being mindful typically involves taking time to pay attention to one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. Therefore, the correct answer is "take time." The other options either do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence or are too similar to the correct answer.
A stray dog is one that has been lost or abandoned and is wandering without a home or owner. Therefore, the most likely place to find a stray dog would be an animal shelter, as they often take in and care for lost or abandoned animals until they can be reunited with their owners or adopted by new families. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to finding a stray dog, as a big house or own home may imply the dog already has an owner, while on a leash implies that the dog already has an owner who is taking them for a walk.
The sentence suggests that there is a place where thousands of companies and a rosebush coexist, and the use of the word "home" implies that this place is limited in space and likely associated with a residence. The only option that fits this description is a backyard, which is typically found at residential properties and can accommodate both companies (e.g. home-based businesses) and a rosebush (a common plant found in backyards). The other options don't provide a clear explanation for how both companies and a rosebush can coexist in the same place.
The sentence suggests that the small dog volunteered somewhere, and given the context of spending time with the elderly, a nursing home is the most likely option. Nursing homes are often associated with elderly care and volunteering opportunities, especially for therapy dogs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that Billy bought silk clothing as a gift for his wife, and the options provided suggest different types of silk clothing that he may have purchased. A nightgown suggests a more intimate or personal gift, while expensive clothing suggests a more luxurious or prestigious gift. Chinatown and garments are not specific enough to connect to the context, and sexy could apply to any type of silk clothing, making it too broad of an option.
The sentence describes a friend's leg shaking out of nerves, and the other person grasping it to prevent any further shaking. This suggests that the desired outcome was for the leg to be still. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence or are opposite in meaning to what is being described.
The sentence suggests that despite being a weasel, Bill was someone you would want on your side. This implies that he had a particular skill or ability that made him valuable. Additionally, the phrase "public office" suggests a position of power or influence, which could be useful when trying to gain an advantage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a specific location where one can find information about the anatomy of a blowfish in print. The most likely source of this information would be in a book, as it is a common medium for educational materials. The other choices are not relevant or do not have a clear connection to the subject matter.
The sentence implies that water is likely to be found in a particular location, and the options provided are all possible locations. However, the context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to plumbing or infrastructure. Toilets are specifically designed to hold and dispose of water, unlike sinks or jars, and are often connected to plumbing that transports water. Bridges and houses may have water sources nearby, but the sentence suggests that the answer should be a specific location inside a building.
The sentence suggests that talking to others can improve our emotional state, but if those individuals are mean or hurtful, they can have the opposite effect and cause negative emotions such as hurt feelings. The other options, dry mouth, changing behavior, communicating with others, and anger, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not mentioned as potential outcomes of talking to mean people.
The sentence suggests that despite everyone being ordinary, they are often told that they possess a quality that sets them apart from others. The word "special" fits this context, as it connotes a unique quality that makes someone stand out from the crowd. The other options, such as "ugly" and "strange," do not fit the positive tone of the sentence and are not supported by the context. "Unbelievable" and "exceptional" may be fitting options, but "special" is the most appropriate given the context of the sentence.
The question implies that something can be added to a building to increase its size. Out of the options given, only "rooms" makes sense as something that can be added to a building. "City", "town", and "urban area" refer to geographic locations, while "fall down" is obviously the opposite of what the question is asking for.
Rows of apple trees are commonly found in orchards, which are often located in rural areas such as the countryside. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of driving through rows of apple trees. The mountains may have trees, but apple orchards are not commonly found at high altitude. Front yards may have apple trees, but they would not be arranged in rows like in an orchard. Wisconsin and Washington State are known for apple production, but simply being in those states does not necessarily indicate that someone would be driving through rows of apple trees.
The sentence suggests that when animals get tired, they do something to rest or take a break. Biting or grooming does not necessarily help them rest, while procreation and keeping alive are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be "lie down," which is a common way animals rest when they are tired.
The other options do not typically sell food items, whereas a supermarket is a common place to purchase groceries and snacks like candy. Movies may have a concession stand that sells candy, but it wouldn't typically offer a wide variety of foods. Malls may have food courts and snack stands, but they are not primarily focused on selling grocery items. Jar and television are also not places where people would typically purchase food items.
The sentence suggests that the claustrophobic person was feeling a certain emotion while getting in line. Claustrophobia is a fear of confined spaces, which can cause anxiety and panic in those who suffer from it. The other options, such as "wait turn" and "late," do not have a direct connection to the claustrophobia described in the sentence. "Nauseous" may be a physical reaction to anxiety, but it is not specific to claustrophobia. "Terrible" is too vague to be a likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the horse had given many rides that day and was likely tired, so it is reasonable to assume that he would have been resting in his stall. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The option "ridden" is incorrect because it doesn't provide an answer to where the horse was found.
The word "practical" suggests that the husband is focused on functionality and cost-effectiveness rather than novelty or adventure. The phrase "house shopping" also implies that the couple is looking to buy a house, which is a major expense. The other choices (arriving, location, excitement, movement) do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A stringed instrument can be heard in a variety of settings, from a classical string quartet in a concert hall or music conservatory, to a rock band on stage, to a music store where instruments are sold and demonstrated, and even in a school music classroom where students may be learning to play. Therefore, all of the options could be correct depending on the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person purchased something with their own money, which indicates that they now own that object. The phrase "have object" also suggests ownership, but the other options ("turn blue", "cross street", "suffer pain") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The mention of a soapy sponge suggests that the person is intending to clean something. The options "wet surface," "collect water," and "hold water" do not make sense in this context as they do not involve cleaning. Holding the sponge is also unlikely to be the correct answer since the person wants to use it. Therefore, "clean dishes" is the most likely answer as it involves using the soapy sponge for its intended purpose.
The sentence suggests that Dan is creative and enjoys reading, and on a rainy day, he wants to make something like what he read. This implies that he may try his hand at writing, which is the process of creating written works such as stories, poems, or essays. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "decanter" is often associated with pouring liquids, and in a chemistry lab, it may be used to transfer chemicals from one container to another. Decanters are also commonly used to aerate wine before drinking, but this answer choice is outside of the scope of the question, as it specifies "outside of drinking alcohol." The kitchen cupboard and restaurant answer choices do not have any clear connection to decanters, while the brewery answer choice specifies alcohol, which is excluded in the question.
The sentence implies that washing clothes involves something passing or moving, and that it is related to the process of washing. It is commonly known that soap and water are used to wash clothes, so "soap and water" and "water and soap" are likely options. Air and effort are not directly related to the process of washing clothes, while time is not a physical substance that can "pass" while washing clothes.
The sentence indicates that the person is hesitant to get food because work has been slow, which suggests that they may be short on money. This would make spending money on lunch an undesirable option. The other choices do not directly relate to the context of the sentence - drinking, beginning work, or eating quickly may not necessarily require spending money, and having lunch is not necessarily an action that one would avoid due to financial concerns.
The sentence suggests that the character is in someone else's kitchen, based on the phrase "of people who just moved in to town." The most likely place for her to be in this scenario would be at the house of new neighbors. The other options, such as a tree house or a restaurant, do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John likes Disney movies and is looking for something to watch, indicating that he is likely interested in watching a Disney movie. The other options (drawer, cabinet, microwave) do not relate to watching movies and are unlikely to be relevant to the sentence. Disneyland also does not fit as it is a theme park and not a place to watch movies.
The question asks what happens if you agree with someone but do not keep the agreement. "Lie" is the only option that suggests intentional deceit, which would be the case if someone agrees to do something but does not follow through. The other options do not relate to breaking an agreement and are not reasonable choices in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person is discussing where to put a lamp in the room where they sleep. Since the lamp is for personal use in the sleeping area, it is most likely meant for the bedroom. The other options, such as desktop, table building, corner, and office, do not fit the context of the sentence and suggest a different location for the lamp.
Rosebushes are typically planted in areas with well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. A lawn is an ideal location for a rosebush because it provides these conditions while also giving the plant room to grow and spread out. Parks may also be suitable, but the other options (Delaware, planting, and Washington) are not specific enough or relevant to the context of the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the purpose of driving to work. Out of the options provided, only "get to work" aligns with the goal of driving to work, which is to arrive at one's workplace. The other options are either negative consequences of driving (speeding ticket, anxiety) or unrelated (use gas, go fast).
The phrase "along with other such enterprises" suggests that the dime store is located in an area with other businesses of a similar nature. A strip mall is a common type of commercial development that features several small stores or shops in a row, often with a large parking lot in front. This setting would be a likely place to find a dime store, along with other businesses such as discount retailers, dollar stores, and chain restaurants. The other options do not fit the description of a strip mall or other commercial development.
The sentence suggests that the paper towels are regularly kept in a visible location in the kitchen, so the most likely place for the dad to search for them would be another easily accessible location within the same room, such as a cabinet. The other options (pantry, grocery store, waste bin, market) are all unlikely solutions due to their disconnect from the context of the sentence.
Expressways are typically found on land and are used to facilitate transportation between different locations on land. The ocean is not a suitable location for an expressway due to the nature of the terrain, which is typically characterized by water rather than a solid surface suitable for building roads. The other options, while not necessarily optimal locations for expressways, do not have any inherent limitations that would make them impossible locations for an expressway.
The sentence suggests that James experiences negative consequences from reading before bed due to his active imagination. Nightmares are a common side effect of reading scary or suspenseful books before bed. Enlightenment and entertainment are positive outcomes that are not hinted at in the sentence. Cramps and drowsiness are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Castle Rock is a prominent location in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is home to Edinburgh Castle, which is one of the most iconic attractions in the country. The other options are not relevant to the location or context of the question.
Monkeys are known to inhabit forests and jungles, and are known for their ability to climb and swing from tree to tree. This suggests that monkeys are commonly found in the tree tops or canopy of forests, rather than in research laboratories or zoos. While some monkeys may be found in zoological gardens, this option is not as specific as the choice of tree tops.
The sentence indicates that some people have a tendency to overshop and purchase products that they would not typically use or need. This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the practicality or usefulness of the products. "Being able to use" fits this description, as it implies that the products are not necessarily functional or necessary for the buyer. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that overeating leads to a particular consequence. The word "obesity" in the choices is a strong indicator that this consequence is related to weight gain. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions heavy rain and cold weather, which are both characteristic of a blizzard. A blizzard is a severe winter storm that includes heavy snowfall and strong winds, so the cold temperature and heavy precipitation described in the sentence fit with this type of storm. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence; a hurricane is a tropical storm with heavy rain and wind, cactus and ocean are not weather events, and drowning is not a type of storm.
In most contexts, a person who is not a citizen of a country is considered a foreigner. This term is commonly used in immigration law and policy discussions, and refers to someone who is from another country and is not a legal resident or citizen of the country in question. The other options in the list (countryfolk, immigrant, subject, and alien) do not accurately describe the concept of being a non-citizen.
The sentence suggests that using addictive drugs is something negative, which implies that it is a choice that should be avoided. The other options do not convey the same negative connotation or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence says the vegan was tired of being hungry, which implies that they were not eating enough food to satisfy their hunger. Since the vegan has not yet quit veganism, it is likely that they will choose an option that aligns with their dietary restrictions. Eating vegetables would be a logical choice since they are a staple in a vegan diet and are known to be filling and nutritious. Making bread or eating quickly may not necessarily alleviate hunger, and having food is too general without any mention of what type of food.
The sentence describes the faucet spraying liquid high up into the air, which resembles the function of a water fountain. A water fountain is specifically designed to create a visually pleasing spraying effect of water in a decorative manner. The other options do not accurately capture the description of the broken faucet's spraying action.
The word "carelessly" suggests that the actions being taken are not well thought out or considered. Making mistakes is a common result of acting carelessly, as it often involves not paying attention or rushing through tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a likely result of acting carelessly.
The sentence suggests that the location in question is a single screen establishment that is not as expensive as other locations. This rules out options like hotels and airports which are typically more expensive. In addition, the mention of an uptick in customers implies that the location is an entertainment venue, which would make options like art shows and airports unlikely. The only remaining option is cinema, which fits the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Justin had to stop dancing because of something physical, specifically fatigue. This means that he likely became tired or exhausted from dancing for a certain amount of time. The other options, such as meeting new people or having fun, do not provide a logical reason for why he had to stop dancing. Additionally, the word "manual" seems out of place and does not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the person did not want to go to a department store to buy the product, which implies that the product is commonly sold in department stores. Disposable razors are commonly found in supermarkets and drugstores as well, making the supermarket option the most likely choice. The other options such as hotel room, garbage, restaurant, and medicine cabinet do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
San Diego is located in southern California, which has a large Mexican-American population and a strong influence of Mexican culture. As a result, it is likely that this city would have a high number of Mexican restaurants. The other options do not have any clear connection to Mexican cuisine or culture.
Social etiquette generally dictates that it is impolite to put your feet on a table, especially when other people are present. This is likely because it is seen as unsanitary and disrespectful to the object, which is usually a piece of furniture or a surface used for eating or working. The other options do not have the same connotation of being unsanitary or disrespectful.
The question is asking where to store a salad bowl when it is not in use. Of the options provided, "cupboard" seems to be the most logical choice as it is commonly used to store dishes and other kitchen utensils. "French restaurant" and "buffet" are places where a salad bowl might be used, but not stored. "Lettuce" is a type of food that might be served in a salad bowl, while "dishwasher" is not a proper storage location for any kitchen utensil.
The sentence suggests that Tuna surprise lacks flavor, which means that it is most likely bland. "Sneaky" and "predictable" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Water buffalo" is a type of animal and is not related to the dish. "Known about" is also unrelated and does not provide any information on the taste of the dish.
The sentence suggests that the cardboard box was used to transport boxes of shoes, which implies that it was likely located in a shoe store or storage area. The fact that Joe found a man sleeping in the box suggests that it was likely in a secluded or hidden location, such as a back alley or storage area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the lesson took place on a tennis court, but it also mentions "paying patients." This suggests that the lesson was not a recreational one, but rather one that was meant to have therapeutic benefits for people who were being treated at a hospital. The other options (health club, park, country club, Wimbledon) do not fit this context.
The sentence suggests that the lizard's movements caused a rustling sound, which is commonly associated with bushes. Bushes have leaves and branches that can rustle and make noise when something moves through them, making them the most likely answer. The other options, such as trees or rocks, do not have the same characteristics that would create a rustling sound.
The sentence suggests that people want to rest when they get tired, and the verb "lay down" indicates a comfortable position to rest or nap. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence. "Speak languages" and "talk to each other" both suggest communication, which is not related to napping or resting. "Imagine" suggests mental activity, which is not related to physical rest. "To work" suggests activity, which is opposite to the concept of rest.
The keyword here is "articles." Photographers often accompany their pictures with articles, and newspapers are a common platform for this type of collaboration. Newspapers usually have a specific section dedicated to photography, where pictures are shown alongside articles that feature them. The other options, such as trunk, art show, fridge, and books, do not make sense in the context of posting pictures alongside articles.
The sentence implies that the teacher wants complete absence of sound or noise, which is typically referred to as silence. The other options may involve some level of noise or talking, even if it is reduced or controlled. Additionally, the phrase "shut up" is a colloquial and impolite way of telling someone to be quiet, while "being quiet" and "think first" may not necessarily convey the same level of strictness and emphasis on silence as "silence" does.
The question is asking about the necessary action to be able to have lunch. Out of the choices provided, "get food" is the most appropriate answer as it implies the acquisition of food, which is necessary before one can eat. "Eat food" is not a valid answer as the question is not asking about what to do during lunch. "Stop working" is not necessarily a requirement for having lunch, and "spend money" may not be applicable in all situations as one can also bring their own food. "Prepare food" is also a valid answer but it is not as specific as "get food" which implies going out or acquiring food from somewher.
The sentence suggests that the person had been running for a long time and it had taken a toll on him. The phrase "he knew it was time to stop" implies that he was becoming fatigued and needed to rest. The other options, such as sore feet or leg cramps, might also be a result of running for a long time, but they do not necessarily indicate that it is time to stop. Shortness of breath might suggest a more serious issue, but there is no indication in the sentence that it was the reason for the person to stop running.
Tabby cats are domesticated animals and are typically happiest and most comfortable in a familiar, safe environment such as their home. The other options may not provide the same level of comfort or safety for the cat. For example, an alley or street would not be a safe place for a cat, while a cellar may be too dark and isolated for a social animal like the tabby cat. Laps may provide comfort, but a cat still needs their own space to retreat to, which is usually found in their home.
The question suggests that the location being referred to is a mountain, which rules out the options of Louisiana and Oregon as they are states and not specific locations. The option of a pet store is also unlikely as it does not relate to a natural habitat for snakes. The option of a tropical forest is also unlikely as snakes in tropical regions tend to inhabit lower elevations. The only plausible option is the Blue Ridge Mountains, where one may find species such as rattlesnakes and copperheads that are known to inhabit mountainous regions.
The sentence suggests that a city employee is handling plants, which implies that the plants are likely part of a public green space that the employee has a responsibility to maintain. Parks are known to have plants and vegetation, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Offices and windowsills are unlikely places for city employees to handle plants, and gardens may be privately owned rather than publicly maintained spaces.
The sentence suggests that John is experiencing a progressive loss of memory, where he is unable to remember events from his recent past. This loss of memory is referred to as forgetting, as opposed to forgotten, which implies that the memory has already been lost. Rehabilitating and forgetfulness both suggest an attempt to improve or treat John's memory loss, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Last forever is also incorrect because it does not accurately reflect John's current situation.
The mention of "queen" and "win" in the sentence suggests that the person was playing a game involving cards (such as poker, bridge, or hearts) where the queen card is often valuable. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that Bill's tire was flat, indicating that his car is in need of repair. The logical next step for Bill would be to take his car to a repair shop to get the tire fixed. The other options, such as Toronto, flammable, car show, and airport do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and would not help Bill with the current problem he is facing.
The sentence suggests that someone who is not known for fighting and is filled with fear will have a natural instinct to do something to protect themselves. Running is a common response to fear and is a natural instinct for self-preservation. None of the other options have a clear connection to fear and self-preservation.
Being stood up on a date often involves feeling disappointed and let down, which can lead to feelings of resentment towards the other party. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response that one might have in this situation.
The sentence mentions a "killing" and the word "immediately" suggests that there will be swift consequences for the action. "Going to jail" and "being imprisoned" are both consequences that can happen immediately after committing a serious crime like killing someone. "Going to the store" and "feeling of guilt" don't make sense in this context, and "no longer live" suggests a permanent consequence rather than an immediate one.
The context of the sentence implies that the crab was being transported for the purpose of being sold and consumed at a food market. The options "Gulf of Mexico" and "North Sea" are bodies of water and do not provide any indication of a destination for a food shipment. "Picnic basket" and "grocery store" may be places where food is consumed or sold, but they do not specifically indicate that the crab is being transported there.
The word "intoxicated" suggests that the person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, impairing their ability to make rational decisions. The word "havoc" suggests that their actions may have caused chaos or damage. The most appropriate choice would be "wreak," as it means to cause widespread damage or destruction. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy was not skilled at communicating with others and that he sought help from a mentor. The most reasonable inference is that he put effort into learning how to better communicate with others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. While exchanging ideas could potentially help with communication, the focus of the sentence seems to be on Billy's personal effort to improve. The options puzzle, confusion, and response do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Jumping rope is a form of exercise that requires physical exertion. Physical activity causes the heart to beat faster to pump oxygen to the muscles, which results in an increased heart rate. Sweating is also a common reaction to physical activity, but it is not necessarily uncomfortable. Having fun and smiling are subjective experiences that may or may not occur during jumping rope. Anger is not a consequence typically associated with jumping rope.
The sentence suggests that the person derives enjoyment from expensive things. This is a common reason why people may choose to spend more money on certain items. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why someone would choose to spend more money on something.
The sentence suggests that the visit with someone has come to an end, and the natural course of action would be to leave the location where the visit took place. "Walk away" is the only choice that accurately describes this action. The other options are either inappropriate or do not make sense in the given context.
The sentence implies that the greed of leadership of a country is motivated by the wealth of another country. When a country has a large amount of wealth, this can create an incentive for those in power to try to acquire it by any means necessary, including through military conquest. The phrase "conquer opponent" suggests an aggressive and forceful approach to acquiring wealth or resources from another country. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shark followed the fish into an area of the water that is deep and dark. The option "deep ocean" is the only choice that describes a location that fits this description. The other options, such as the desert, Sea World, or a maritime museum, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The name "Aberdeen" is commonly associated with Scotland, as it is a major city located in the northeast region of the country. None of the other options listed are known for having a city named Aberdeen. Additionally, the word "city" implies a larger urban area, which would rule out options like South Dakota and Maryland.
The word "dangerous" in the sentence suggests that there is a significant risk involved in the events. In such situations, there is a real possibility that the competitors could get seriously injured or even die. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is "death." The other options, such as "boredom" or "accomplishment," do not fit with the context of the sentence as they are not consequences of participating in dangerous events.
The combination of dancing and a bar is a common feature of nightclubs. Nightclubs are establishments that typically feature loud music, dancing, and alcohol. The other options do not necessarily have dancing or a bar as a central feature.
The word "examine" suggests that the person is looking closely and studying the item. If they are doing this for a long time, it indicates that they are interested in the product and want to make an informed decision about it. "Angry" does not fit the context, and "know what" and "might want" are not feelings. "Interesting" is a possible option, but "interested in" is a more fitting choice for the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that waking up with sweats is not a normal occurrence when working out, but rather a symptom of something else. One common cause of waking up with sweats is a fever, which is a sign of an underlying illness or infection. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman was engaged in some form of introspection or self-reflection, which made her consider her choice of makeup. Reflection often involves deep thought and contemplation about one's self and experiences. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a good name for a small dog, which suggests that the answer should be a name that is appropriate for a small or cute animal. The options "animal shelter", "big house", and "georgia" are not names and do not have any clear connection to small dogs. "Fur" could be a potential name for a small dog, but it is also a physical characteristic of the animal, which may cause confusion. "Basket" is a name that is often used for small and cute animals, such as rabbits or puppies, and therefore would make a good name for a small dog.
Bald eagles are a species of bird that are native to North America and are often found in areas with abundant water sources, such as lakes or rivers. They are also known for building their nests in high trees or cliffs, which can make them vulnerable to human disruption. A nature reserve would provide a protected area where the eagles could live and hunt without disturbance from humans. The other options are unlikely choices for a bald eagle, as they do not provide the necessary habitat or protection for the bird.
The sentence suggests that the golfer remained calm on the outside but was feeling a strong emotion internally, implying that he was excited about his victory. The other options involve negative emotions such as wild, frenzied, frantic, and agitated, which are not consistent with the idea of a successful golfer.
A kosher deli is a delicatessen that follows Jewish dietary laws, which means that it does not serve certain types of meat and dairy products unless they have been prepared in a specific way. Jewish neighborhoods are more likely to have a kosher deli than other places because they have a larger population of Jewish people who adhere to these dietary restrictions. While Jerusalem is a city with a significant Jewish population, the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions two clues - coasts and sloth - which are commonly associated with Costa Rica. Costa Rica is a country that is located in Central America and has both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines. It is also known for its biodiversity, including many species of animals, such as sloths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where it may be difficult to do homework if you have cleaned off dust in a specific location. This suggests that the location in question is nearby or connected to where one would typically do homework. A desktop is a common surface for doing homework, and if it has been cleaned off, it may be difficult to work there until it is set up again. The other options do not have a clear relation to homework or to cleaning off dust.
The sentence mentions that John loves plants because of how they look, which suggests that he is interested in their visual appeal. Out of the options given, flower petals are the most visually striking part of a plant, with their bright colors and distinctive shapes. Cut off limbs and have roots do not relate to the aesthetic qualities of plants, while bloom and grow in garden are too general and do not specifically refer to any particular part of a plant.
The sentence suggests that something will be made easier during good weather in the winter. Climbing and riding a bike are physical activities that may not necessarily be affected by the weather, so they are less likely to be the correct answer. "Go somewhere" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer. "Travel" is the most likely answer because winter weather often makes travel difficult, with snow and ice causing delays and cancellations. Good weather would make travel easier by improving visibility and making roads safer to drive on.
The sentence implies that the plants are indoors and need sunlight, which suggests that they are in a pot or container. The options "roof," "park," and "surface of earth" are not relevant to the context of indoor plant care. While plants can certainly be placed in the ground outside and still get plenty of sunlight, the sentence specifies that the question is about how to ensure they get sunlight indoors. This leaves "windowsill" as the most logical choice, as placing plants on a windowsill is a common way to ensure they get sufficient sunlight while indoors.
The phrase "run in packs" suggests that the small dog is part of a group. Out of the given options, an apartment complex is more likely to have multiple small dogs living in close proximity to each other. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for multiple dogs to run in a pack.
Music stores are a common place to find books and materials related to music education, including scales, sheet music, and instructional books. The other options, such as the post office, assay office, butcher shop, or doctor's office, do not have any clear connection to music education or providing resources for mastering a music scale.
The sentence implies that the phrase being referred to describes people who are not concerned about the quality of their food. The option "cheap" is related, but it does not specifically refer to the quality of the food. The options "convenient", "bad workmanship", and "poor workmanship" are unrelated and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about releasing energy from fat, which implies the process of metabolism. When your body metabolizes fat for energy, it undergoes a process called oxidation, which involves breaking down the fat molecules and releasing energy. The most appropriate term among the choices for this process is "burn," which accurately describes the chemical reaction that takes place. The other options may be related to physical activity or mental processes, but they are not directly related to the biological process of energy release from fat.
A car is a vehicle designed to travel on roads, making "road" the most logical choice. While a car may visit an airport or repair shop, these locations are not where a car belongs. A race track or freeway are also possibilities, but not all cars are designed for racing or high-speed travel, so "road" is the most universally applicable choice.
The sentence suggests that getting drunk and stumbling may lead to a physical sensation, which is often associated with nausea. Drinking too much alcohol can cause disruption to the stomach and digestive system, leading to feelings of nausea and possibly vomiting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests a contrast between a pile of something in the driveway (presumably snow) and the peaceful appearance of a snowflake. The only option that relates to the appearance of a snowflake is "air," as snowflakes are individual, delicate and graceful in the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the farmer knew that potatoes would not grow in the city, which implies that he must look for a rural or agricultural area where he could find suitable land to plant potatoes. The choice "countryside" is the most logical since it is associated with farming and agriculture, and it is where farmers usually cultivate their crops. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Board games are typically played indoors, and the most common indoor location for playing board games is in someone's home, such as their house or den. The other options, such as shelf or toy store, are not locations where board games are typically played but may be places where they are stored or purchased. The term "shelter" could refer to a variety of locations, but it is not clear from the question whether it is a indoor or outdoor location.
A square is a geometric shape that has four sides of equal length and four angles of 90 degrees each. Therefore, the correct answer is that a square is constructed of four sides. The other options are not related to the definition of a square and can be eliminated.
Memorization often involves repetition, as the process of repeating information helps to reinforce it in the mind. Concentration may also be involved, but the act of repetition is more directly related to the question. Storing data may be a necessary step in the process of memorization, but it is not necessarily something that someone actively does during the process. Being awake is a prerequisite for memorization, but it is not a specific action that someone takes in order to memorize something.
The sentence mentions that the workplace is informal and that the cashier loves antiques. A shop is more likely to have an informal atmosphere and sell antiques than a fast food restaurant, supermarket, or grocery store. While a bookstore may also have an informal atmosphere, there is no mention in the sentence of the cashier having a love for books or literature.
The sentence mentions that John's vessel went down while he was traveling from Britain to America, indicating he is likely in the ocean. Additionally, the sentence mentions that there is no land in sight, further suggesting that he is in a large body of water such as the ocean. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
The other options listed are not types of science. "Space lab" and "university" refer to physical locations, while "methodology" and "school" are more general terms that could refer to a variety of fields. "Nanotechnology," on the other hand, is a specific field of science that deals with materials and devices of a very small scale, typically at the nanometer level. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the hair dryer was still in its original packaging, which would most likely be a box. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The bathroom could be a possible location for using a hair dryer, but it does not explain why the hair would have already dried before she took the dryer out. The trash and drug store are not relevant to the sentence at all, and the beauty salon is not a likely location for someone using a brand new hair dryer at home.
The sentence mentions the presence of mold covering a padding that was not visible until it was pulled up. The only option that could potentially have a padding that could hide mold and be pulled up is the carpet. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah sat down to read her newspaper, which is a common activity that people do while sitting in a chair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - a rug is not typically associated with sitting to read, nor is a front door or jail, and while a porch may be a place to sit, the sentence does not suggest that Sarah is outside.
The question is asking about the body part that is doing the work while drinking, so the most logical answer would be the one involved in the act of swallowing. The other options are either related to the container used for drinking (glass) or the action of bringing the drink to one's mouth (mouth). Therefore, swallowing is the correct answer as it involves the physical action of pushing the liquid down the throat.
The sentence suggests that buckeyes and apples are related in some way, and that they grow well in a particular state. Buckeyes are the state tree of Ohio, so it is likely that the sentence is referring to that state. Additionally, Ohio is known for its apple production, so this makes the most sense as the answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the ficus is located at an entrance, which typically indicates a public space rather than a private home. The options "arboretum," "wet places," and "great outdoors" do not fit the context of a specific entrance.
The question is asking which moving object will make a person happy to have, and out of the options given, only "own car" fits that description. Catching a cold is a negative experience, experiencing joy is a feeling rather than an object, a submarine is not typically owned or associated with happiness, and believing in God is a personal belief rather than a physical object. Therefore, "own car" is the correct answer.
The use of the phrase "raise my hand" suggests that the person is likely in a classroom setting where the norm is to raise your hand to get the teacher's attention or ask a question. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking for a term that describes someone who creates art. The correct answer is "artist" since that is the specific word used to describe someone who makes visual or performing art. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide an accurate or relevant answer.
The question asks about the emotional result of having fun, which is typically associated with positive feelings. Glee, laughter, being happy, and smiling are all common expressions of joy and happiness. Injuries, on the other hand, are not related to the emotional experience of having fun and therefore do not fit the context of the question.
The sentence implies that when you buy beer, you give the cashier something and they give you back less of it. The only logical option is money since it is the currency used to purchase goods. The other options do not make sense in the context of buying beer at a store.
Mice are known to enter homes through small openings or cracks, and the attic is a common entry point as it often has gaps or openings that lead to the exterior of the house. Garages and cupboards may have entry points, but they are not as common as attics. Kitchens are also not likely to be entry points for mice as they do not usually have direct access to the exterior of the house. Sewers are more likely to be an exit point for mice, rather than an entry point into a house.
The sentence suggests that a sailor must complete preparation work before the ship can leave, implying that the sailor has already arrived at the dock or harbor where the ship is located. Therefore, the first step the sailor must take is to board the ship. The other options do not address the initial step required for the ship to leave, and "coming home" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the barber shop is located north of the U.S., which eliminates all the other options except for Canada. Canada is the only country located north of the U.S. Among the other options, small town, neighborhood, high street, and motel can be found anywhere in the U.S. but not north of it.
The sentence suggests that Sarah drank from a water fountain that is accessible to the general public. Water fountains are commonly found in public places such as parks, schools, and other areas that are accessible to a large number of people. The other options are not necessarily associated with water fountains or public access.
The sentence suggests that the ficus plant is not inside the house but is still protected from bugs, which rules out placing it near windows or in shady places where insects are more likely to be. Clay pots or multiple pots do not necessarily offer bug protection, and the choice of words "protected from bugs" implies a deliberate effort to keep the plant safe from pests, which is often easier to achieve in an enclosed or screened area such as a porch.
The sentence suggests that the general did something that he didn't like but felt compelled to do. "Make war" is a common phrase that means to engage in military conflict, which is often a necessary but unpleasant task for a general. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be things that a general would do.
The sentence suggests that the child wants to do something fun or enjoyable after school. Playing video games is a common pastime for many children, and is often associated with leisure and entertainment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence mentions a shuttle being inverted onto a launch platform, which is a clear reference to the space program. NASA is the government agency responsible for managing the United States' civilian space program, and would be the most likely entity to be operating a shuttle in this context. The other options, such as a battleship or a trapeze, have no connection to the space program or launching shuttles.
It is a common practice for barbers to use a comb to style and tidy up a customer's hair before they leave the shop. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not typically used right before leaving. Military base and Seville have no clear connection to the context of a barber shop, and small town is too general to be a specific answer.
Gazelles are known for their speed and agility and are typically found in grasslands and open areas where they can easily run and maneuver. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "open field", as it is the only option that is associated with an environment that would be suitable for a gazelle to run in. The other options, such as "uphill", "asia", and "encyclopedia", have no clear connection to the behavior of gazelles. "Steppe" may be a plausible choice, but it is less specific than "open field" and may not necessarily evoke the same mental image of a vast and unobstructed landscape.
The use of the words "steel cable" suggest that the correct answer involves something that is suspended or hanging, and that can support weight. Only a suspension bridge fits this description, as it is constructed using steel cables and can support the weight of people walking across it. The other options do not involve a steel cable or the ability to support weight in the same way.
The phrase "performing successfully" implies that the person is achieving their goals and succeeding in their endeavors. Therefore, the answer choice that best fits with this context is "achieve." The other options, such as anxiety, fear, and energetic, do not necessarily correlate with performing successfully. Happiness may be a possible outcome of success, but it is not directly stated in the question.
The sentence states that John was running late for work, which suggests that he may have felt pressure to arrive on time. Anxiety and stress are also possible emotions in this situation, but boredom and getting there do not fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "crossroads" is often used figuratively to describe a point in someone's life where they have to make an important decision that will significantly affect their future. Therefore, the correct answer is life. The other options are not relevant in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the dog is disobedient and that the owner has not given it something that could potentially encourage obedience, like a treat. However, the incorrect choices do not provide any logical reasoning that could be inferred from the sentence. The use of the word "wild" suggests that the dog could have become feral, but the choices of "guard house" and "abandoned" do not align with that idea, whereas "punishment" is a common technique to train a disobedient dog.
The sentence suggests that Bill had to pay taxes on the full price, regardless of any special deal or offer he received. The word "discount" indicates that Bill received a reduced price, but he still had to pay taxes on the original amount. The other options do not provide any clear indication of why Bill had to pay tax on the full price. "Refund" and "less money" both suggest that the price was reduced, but do not indicate why Bill had to pay taxes on the full amount. "Death and" and "free money" are not related to the context of the sentence at all.
The sentence suggests that hurting someone else may have negative consequences for the offender, which could include legal problems. Hurting someone else could result in charges of assault or other crimes, leading to legal repercussions. The other options do not reflect this specific consequence and may not be relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the girl went somewhere to drink a cup of coffee, which suggests that the answer is a place where people typically go to purchase coffee. The most likely option is a coffee shop. The other options, such as desk, office, upstairs, and table, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James was unable to attend an event because the ticket office was sold out and that the event was likely related to football. Since the other options (auditorium, arena, city, and area) don't specifically relate to hosting football-related events, the correct answer is likely stadium, which is a venue commonly used for sports events such as football games.
The sentence suggests that the person gave a thoughtful reply to a question, which is what was overlooked. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When you throw litter away, it typically falls to the ground. This is the most logical answer choice based on common sense and knowledge of how litter behaves. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The question asks for a negative consequence of learning about the world, which suggests that there may be negative aspects to gaining knowledge. "Loss of innocence" in this context generally refers to becoming aware of harsh realities or unpleasant truths, which can be a difficult and painful process. The other options may be negative consequences in certain contexts, but they are not necessarily related to learning about the world.
Wild cats, such as lions, tigers, and leopards, are typically found in warm environments such as savannas, forests, and grasslands. They require warmth to survive and thrive, which is why they are not typically found in colder environments such as mountains or colder regions of the world. The other choices, such as restaurants, beams of sunlight, or floors, do not have any connection to the natural habitat of wild cats.
The sentence suggests that something has replaced wood in most people's dwellings. The sentence also implies that this replacement is common and something that people have in their homes. The only option that meets these criteria is "carpet," which is a common flooring material used in many homes as an alternative to wood. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly found in people's homes or do not replace wood in any way.
Saying farewell to someone is often accompanied by a wave goodbye, which is a common gesture used to signify goodbye or farewell. Rubbing their head, experiencing fear, watching television, and springing into action do not make sense in the context of saying farewell, and are not commonly associated with this situation.
When taking a bath, your body becomes wet because you are submerging yourself in water. "Cleanness" is a result of a bath, not something that covers you during it. "Exfoliation" refers to the process of removing dead skin cells, which may occur during a bath but isn't something that covers you. "Use water" is not a covering but an action that is taken during a bath. "Rash" is a skin irritation and not something that covers you during a bath.
The sentence suggests that the first team had a significant lead over the second team, with over 100 points compared to the second team trailing by more than 50 points. This implies that the second team is likely to lose the game, as they have a lot of ground to make up in order to catch up with the first team. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is referring to a place beyond our world, which is commonly associated with outer space. The solar system and galaxy are both within our world, and countries are not typically associated with other worlds. Narnia is a fictional world, so it is not applicable in a literal sense.
The sentence implies that finding out about going somewhere has a positive connotation, which is often associated with the feeling of excitement. Getting excited is a natural response to the prospect of experiencing something new or potentially enjoyable, which also aligns with the context of the sentence. The other options may not make as much sense or may be too specific to the mode of transportation.
The sentence indicates that the old clothes were not useful even as rags, implying that they were in very poor condition and could not be salvaged. Therefore, the most appropriate place for them would be the trash. The other options (loft, attic, trunk) suggest potential storage locations which do not align with the given context. Meanwhile, the fire pit option is an unlikely place for old clothes to belong.
The sentence mentions a machine that takes quarters, which is a common feature of laundromats where customers pay to use washers and dryers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - assembly lines typically involve automated machinery, streets are not typically associated with machines that take quarters, the White House is a government building and not a place where laundry is done, and simply "house" is too vague to make a clear connection.
The sentence implies that Sam is employed at a union shop, meaning a workplace where employees are represented by a labor union. In such workplaces, joining the union may be a requirement for continued employment, as the union negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the employer on behalf of its members. Sam not wanting to join the union suggests that he may have personal objections to being in a union, but if he wants to continue working at the shop, he has no choice but to join or leave the workplace. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that learning about the world and its injustices is likely to have a negative impact on a person, which can be further supported by the use of the phrase "loss of innocence." The other answer choices do not fit the context, as anger and pleasure are emotions that are not necessarily tied to learning about injustices, while happiness and enlightenment are more positive outcomes that are generally associated with gaining knowledge.
Divorce is often associated with emotional struggles and grief, especially for the person getting divorced. Studies have shown that divorce can lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety, and often involves a period of adjustment and recovery. The other options are not necessarily negative effects of divorce, and some may even be considered positive, depending on the individual's perspective. For example, "freedom" and "no spouse" may be seen as positive outcomes for someone who feels trapped or unhappy in their marriage. "Happiness" may also be a desired outcome, but it is not necessarily the result of divorce for everyone. "Children suffer" is also a commonly cited negative effect of divorce, but it involves other people and is not specified in the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to a specific city known for its nightlife and club scene. New York is commonly associated with its vibrant nightlife, and is home to many famous nightclubs, making it the most likely answer. The other options, such as "major city" or "building," are too broad and don't provide enough context to determine a specific answer.
The phrase "use a large vehicle made up of multiple sections that are attached to each other" is commonly associated with trains or railway systems. The options "bus station" and "bus" may be tempting choices, but the key word "sections" suggests that the vehicle being referred to is not a bus, which is usually made up of a single compartment. The other options, "park" and "town," are not relevant to the context of the question.
The question is asking for a way to be social while completing assignments, therefore, studying together would be the most appropriate answer. Arm wrestling is a physical activity and doesn't relate to studying, while studying philosophy and reading books can be done individually, and further education refers to continuing education beyond the current assignment.
The sentence suggests that the woman used a tactic of surprising the man with a kiss to convince him to continue with the plan, indicating that she was trying to manipulate his actions. The other options do not convey this sense of intentional influence and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence suggests that the man was so tired that he needed to rest, and he soon fell to something that indicates a state of deep relaxation. The most appropriate option is sleep because it is a natural state of rest that allows the body to recharge and recover. The other options, such as relax or sit down, do not imply a state of deep relaxation that is necessary for the man to recover. The option "his death" is incorrect because it is not a natural consequence of the man being exhausted and needing rest.
The sentence suggests that someone who sings well possesses a certain trait, and the most likely trait is having a good voice. The other options do not accurately describe a trait that someone who sings well would possess. Annoying people around does not relate to singing well, and enjoy and practice are actions rather than traits. Nice sound is a possibility, but having a good voice is more commonly used to describe someone who sings well.
The question is asking specifically about a place where a writing instrument is needed, so options like pocket and purse do not fit the context. Similarly, stationary may refer to a store selling writing supplies, but it does not indicate a specific location where a writing instrument is needed. The correct answer is writer's hand, as this is where a writing instrument is typically held and used for writing. Classroom could also be a possible answer if the context of the question is related to a learning environment where writing often occurs.
The word "cafeteria" refers to a space where people go to acquire and consume food. Schools typically have cafeterias where students go during lunch periods to eat. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not related to the purpose of a cafeteria.
The botanist's observation suggests that he was able to observe the plant's respiratory processes, which are indicative of it being a living organism. Respiration is the process by which living organisms exchange gases with the environment, specifically taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. The other options are not related to the processes of living organisms or plant biology.
Illinois and Iowa are two of the top corn-producing states in the United States. Therefore, it is likely that a farmer in either state would be primarily raising or growing corn crops. The other options, such as growing or seeding plants, and growing animals do not have the same association with the agricultural practices of these states as raising corn does.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoyed working in a factory, which implies that they were involved in some form of production. The phrase "for sale" further emphasizes this point, as it implies that the goods produced were intended for commercial purposes. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. "Earn money" is a possible motivation for working in a factory, but it doesn't explain what the person actually did. "Introduction" and "workhour" don't make sense in this context. "Create" is a possibility, but it is less specific than "produce goods."
The sentence talks about a windstorm damaging something that needed to be replaced. The most likely option for something that is damaged by a windstorm and needs to be replaced is a roof. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that jumping up and down leads to a specific set of symptoms, specifically dizziness and headaches. While exercise and exhaustion can cause dizziness and tiredness, they are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Cramps are a physical discomfort, but not necessarily associated with jumping up and down. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is dizziness and headaches.
The sentence implies that the person's hard work in taking care of proposals has led to some form of positive outcome. The word "good" suggests that the outcome was desirable, and the context of the sentence implies that this outcome was a result of the person's diligence. The other options are not directly tied to the context of the sentence and do not make as much sense based on the information given.
The sentence suggests that the picture in question is one that you want to see frequently, which implies that it is important to you and you want to easily access it. The desktop of a computer is a common place to put frequently accessed files, icons or shortcuts. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to storing digital images or accessing them easily.
Downtown areas of cities are often cultural hubs that attract various forms of entertainment, including music performances. Concert halls are common in downtown areas, as they offer a central location for audiences to gather and enjoy live music. While commercial buildings, university buildings, and theaters may also have performance spaces, there is no specific indication that they are more likely to have a concert hall than any other type of building. Musicians, while associated with music, are not relevant to the question of where a concert hall is likely to be located.
The sentence suggests that the expert is performing on stage and is hoping for something positive to happen. The options "explode," "stage fright," and "injury" all suggest negative outcomes, which are unlikely to be the expert's goal. "Getting attention" could be a goal, but it is not a clear indication of success since the attention could be positive or negative. "Being appreciated" is a more positive and specific goal, which would imply that the audience is enjoying and valuing the performance.
Roses are commonly known for their pink or red flowers, although they can also come in other colors such as white or yellow. The sentence does not provide any context to suggest that the answer would be "vase," "blue," or "fragrant," which are not characteristics of the flowers themselves.
The sentence suggests that the teacher was hungry after a long day of teaching and grading homework, indicating that she would likely want to eat something. The option "prepare dinner" is the most logical and expected response in this context. The other options do not make sense or are inappropriate, such as "eat children."
The sentence suggests that someone is likely to feel a negative emotion in response to someone hurting someone else. Out of the choices, only "angry" fully captures that negative emotion. "Feel remorse" implies a feeling of guilt or regret, which would be inappropriate for the wronged party. "Will resent" suggests a long-term grudge against the perpetrator, which isn't necessarily implied by the sentence. "Feel sad" doesn't capture the sense of moral outrage that the word "hurt" implies. "Bad karma" is not a valid emotional response, but rather a spiritual or philosophical concept.
The sentence states that a dictionary was important for teachers and students, which suggests that the purpose of the dictionary was to aid in learning and understanding the meanings of words. The other options (manual, shelf, table, classroom) do not relate to the function or purpose of a dictionary.
The sentence indicates that John threw trash onto a field, which suggests that he is in an outdoor space. Of the choices provided, park is the most likely option as it is a common outdoor space where people might gather and a field is often found in a park. The other options, such as wastepaper basket and wastebasket, are containers for trash and not relevant to the context of the sentence. The garbage dump is a location for dumping large amounts of trash and is unlikely to be where John threw his trash. While John could be at a soccer game, the sentence doesn't provide any direct indication that he is there specifically.
The sentence suggests that Joe dislikes interruptions during his lunch, specifically phone calls. The word "irritation" implies a feeling of annoyance or frustration, which would likely be the emotional response to an interruption during a meal. The other options are not as relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that being interrupted while creating art can have a negative impact on the artist, as the word "likely" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between interruptions and an emotional response. The option "relax" is unlikely to be correct because interruptions are inherently disruptive and stressful. "Pleasure" and "controversy" also do not make sense in this context. "Park" is unrelated to the sentence and can be eliminated as an option.
The sentence suggests that the couple was having sex frequently in an attempt to conceive a child, which can be physically exhausting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people are discussing a problem, which indicates a need for problem solving or brainstorming solutions. Shared ideas could lead to better solutions or a more collaborative approach to solving the problem. The other options do not specifically relate to discussing a problem or finding solutions.
The sentence suggests that James had difficulty finding a place to park, which is often a problem in urban areas with busy downtown districts. Taking a bus is a common alternative to driving in such areas. None of the other options in the choices have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Since James is raking leaves, it is logical to assume that he will leave the pile on the ground, which is where the leaves were before he gathered them. Leaves are usually left on the ground to decompose and provide nutrients for the soil, or they may be collected into compost bins. The other options do not make sense in this context; leaving the pile on a roof or in a tree, for example, would be impractical and unlikely.
Cats are known for their ability to sleep for long periods of time throughout the day and night. They typically sleep in a relaxed position, curled up with their legs tucked under their body or stretched out flat. The other options do not describe a typical sleeping position for a cat.
The sentence implies that some people play poker in tournaments for the prizes and challenge, indicating a competitive aspect to the game. While playing poker can be casual and for fun, the reference to tournaments and prizes highlights the importance of competition. The other options do not necessarily align with the context of the sentence, as casinos, losing money, and social events are not necessarily the main reason people participate in poker tournaments.
Viruses need to infect a host cell in order to reproduce because they lack the necessary machinery and resources to do so on their own. The other options do not relate to the reproductive process of viruses and therefore can be eliminated as incorrect answers.
The word "rows and rows" suggests a large number of speakers, which is typically associated with concerts or other large events where sound needs to fill a large space. The other options, such as desktop or headphones, would typically only have a small number of speakers or drivers. Town halls and conferences may have more speakers than a desktop or headphone, but still not to the extent of a concert setup.
The sentence suggests that the politician's actions are motivated by a desire to serve his constituents well, rather than personal gain. This aligns with the characteristic of honesty, which involves being truthful and having strong moral principles. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence references the Mongallan gazelle, which is a type of gazelle that is native to the desert regions of Mongolia. Therefore, it is likely that the sentence is asking about the southern region of a desert, rather than a game preserve, wildlife refuge, or country on the other side of the African continent such as the Ivory Coast or Sudan.
The sentence mentions that the two best friends had a slumber party, which is typically a sleepover where people stay at someone's house. The other options, such as a movie theatre or internet cafe, do not make sense in the context of a slumber party. Additionally, a fraternity house or school may not be suitable places for two best friends to have a slumber party.
The sentence suggests that Sally did not like the straight blade of the sword she saw. This implies that she is looking for a sword with a different shape. The word "curved" is the best choice because it is the opposite of "straight" and suggests a different shape for the blade. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "a lot on his plate" suggests that the individual had a lot of tasks and responsibilities to handle, which can be overwhelming and cause stress. Additionally, starting a business is a significant undertaking that can be stressful, as there are many uncertainties and potential challenges. The other options, such as making money or success, are not necessarily negative outcomes and do not directly relate to the context of the sentence. Failure could also be a possible outcome, but it is not specified in the sentence.
The sentence indicates that some people enjoy living life quickly, which suggests that they may participate in dangerous or risky activities that can lead to accidents and even death. The other options do not make sense in the context of living life fast.
The question is asking about the potential negative consequence of relaxing too much, so options like satisfaction and feeling better are unlikely to be correct. Invigorating also does not make sense as it describes a positive outcome. Sleeping could be a potential consequence of too much relaxing, but laziness is a more accurate and common result. Laziness refers to a lack of motivation or activity, which can occur if one spends too much time being leisurely and not engaging in productive or stimulating activities.
The sentence suggests that John may have considered sitting on the floor as an alternative to the hard plastic chair he was sitting in at the airport. This is because sitting on the floor can often be uncomfortable for long periods of time, especially in a public place like an airport where there may be limited seating options. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Birthdays and Christmas are traditionally occasions where people give and receive gifts. The other options are less commonly associated with these specific occasions. While someone might understand themselves better on their birthday or have a moment of self-reflection, it is not necessarily a common or expected activity. Compliments and acknowledgment might be exchanged, but they are not a central aspect of the celebration. Drinking might occur as part of a festive atmosphere, but it is not a defining characteristic of birthdays or Christmas.
The sentence suggests that the location where they returned to their hotel has many sights to offer after a magic show. A touristic area is a place that is specifically designed to attract visitors and typically contains various attractions and activities for tourists. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
St. Paul is the capital city of Minnesota, so the correct answer would be Minnesota. The fact that a bald eagle is flying over St. Paul is simply additional information and not relevant to the answer. The other choices, such as Texas, Thermal, Canada, and Photograph, are not related to the context of the question.
A stroke can cause paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, which is often the left side if the stroke occurred in the right hemisphere of the brain. This can result in the loss of strength on the left side of the body, which can affect the person's ability to perform daily tasks and activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that clothes are covering a surface, which is most likely a piece of furniture. Out of the given choices, a chair is the most logical option as it is a common place to temporarily store clothes. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not typically associated with clothing storage.
Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures, and anthropologists often investigate the origins of human behavior and cultural practices. James, as an anthropologist, likely has knowledge about the early development of human communication and expression. The sentence suggests that James believes that creating art was one of the earliest forms of communication, which is a widely accepted theory in anthropology. The other options, such as "penguins" and "relax," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Turkey is commonly associated with causing both indigestion and sleepiness in individuals who consume it. Indigestion may occur due to the high fat content in turkey, which can be difficult to digest. Sleepiness may be caused by the presence of tryptophan, an amino acid found in turkey that can promote the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which can make you feel drowsy. Thanksgiving is a holiday that often involves eating turkey, but it is not a direct effect of consuming turkey. Throwing up and heartburn are less common side effects of eating turkey.
The sentence suggests that the security detail was scanning something that could help them keep an eye on the entire crowd. The option "potato" is unrelated and does not make sense in context. "Body" and "person's head" are too specific and would not allow the security detail to keep track of everyone in the crowd. "Focus" is too vague and doesn't fit the context. Therefore, the most logical answer is "faces" because it is common for security personnel to continually scan the faces of people in a crowd to identify potential threats or individuals of interest.
The sentence suggests that Sam enjoyed buying Christmas presents because it made him feel a certain way. The word "pleasure" is the most appropriate choice because it implies a sense of enjoyment or satisfaction. The other options do not fit as well because they either do not relate to Sam's feelings or have a negative connotation (lack of money, relief).
The sentence implies that there is some device or equipment involved in using television, and that it needs to be connected in some way for others to be able to use it. The phrase 'plug in' suggests that it is referring to connecting the television to a power source, which is necessary for it to work. The other options (turn on electricity, open eyes, kill, watch television) do not make sense in this context.
The sentence implies that John was asleep on his couch and had a dream, but then woke up outside in the rain wrestling an inflatable chair. This suggests that he was sleepwalking, or moving around while still asleep. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Historically, rulers and monarchs held court in their palaces, which were their main residences and bases of power. A public building, such as a government building or courthouse, may also be a location for holding court, but it is less likely for a ruler to hold court in a public setting. A city or gymnasium are not appropriate locations for holding court, while a conference room may be used for important meetings or negotiations, but it is not a traditional location for holding court.
The sentence states that the peaceful nation is scared of their neighbor amassing troops at the border, which implies that the neighbor is showing hostile and aggressive behavior. Belligerent means hostile and aggressive, making it the most suitable answer. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence as the fear is not about warring or violence in general, nor is it about a constitutional referendum.
The term "homeschool" refers to a type of education where a student is taught by their parents or guardians at home, rather than attending a traditional school. The other options - classroom, university, parents school, and ask questions - do not accurately describe this type of education. It's important to note that homeschooling can be done in different ways, such as through online programs or with the help of teachers/tutors, but the key characteristic is that it is primarily taught at home.
The sentence describes Joe as someone who uses complex words with multiple meanings, which suggests he is likely educated and knowledgeable in a particular field. A law firm is a professional setting where such skills would be valuable, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to Joe's skills or personality.
The sentence mentions that the cave is near the capital of Charleston, which is located in West Virginia. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Empty food cans are typically made of aluminum or steel, both of which are recyclable materials. Recycling centers are specialized facilities that collect and process these materials for reuse. The other options (store, backpack, house, supermarket) do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Denny was searching for his hairbrush in his living space, which eliminates the options of car and drugstore. The fact that he closed the door behind him hints that he was searching in a room, which could be his bedroom or any other room in the house. However, since the sentence doesn't provide any cues about his morning routine or where he usually keeps his hairbrush, bedroom seems like the most logical option.
The sentence suggests that stopping medication may lead to the return of symptoms, which is commonly referred to as a recurrence. This is a known risk for individuals with mental illnesses who stop taking their medication, as medication is often used to manage and ameliorate symptoms. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they suggest different outcomes from stopping medication.
The question is asking where one might find items made from wood, suggesting that the answer is a place that sells or supplies wood products. The most likely option is a lumberyard, which typically stocks a wide variety of wood products for use in construction, furniture, and other applications. The other options (own home, electric store, carpet, boat) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the availability or use of wood products.
The question suggests that the cloud is not visible due to darkness. None of the choices provided relate to visibility in the absence of light, so none of them are correct.
The sentence suggests that Sam's expectations for his savings in terms of growth were not met, indicating that his savings did not increase in value over time. The word "diminish" means to decrease in size or value, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect what happens to savings when they do not grow, with "explode" being particularly unrealistic.
The sentence implies that the growth of one plant is dependent on the growth of another. When a plant increases in size, it is able to provide more nutrients and resources to other plants that are growing in its vicinity, which allows them to grow as well. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence - plants cannot give up or die in order to make another grow, and saying that a plant "gets bigger" is less specific than saying it "increases in size."
A sporting goods store is a specific type of store that specializes in selling sports equipment, so it is the most likely choice for where one can find sports equipment. The other options do not make sense in this context: a mall is a shopping center that may or may not have a sporting goods store, a bathroom is unlikely to have sports equipment for sale, a school typically does not sell sports equipment, and a sporting event is a place to watch sports, not to buy sports equipment.
The term "niece" indicates that the child is the daughter of the person's sibling, which is most likely a brother. Therefore, the correct answer would be "brother's house," as this implies that the niece would live with her uncle or aunt (the person answering the question) at the brother's house. The other options do not provide a clear answer to the question, as they are not related to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the ocean that comes after the Antarctic Ocean in alphabetical order. The options are listed in random order and the correct choice can be determined by listing them alphabetically. Antarctic and Atlantic are both A's at the beginning, but Atlantic comes after Antarctic because the C in Atlantic comes after the T in Antarctic. The other options are not in close proximity to Atlantic alphabetically.
While learning can be a positive experience that leads to gaining knowledge and increased effectiveness, it can also lead to negative emotions such as distress. This may occur when the learning material is particularly challenging or when the learner feels overwhelmed by the amount of information presented. Dysfunction is also a possibility, but it is not as closely associated with the process of learning as distress is. Happiness is not typically considered a negative emotion or feeling associated with learning.
In a typical town setting, houses are often surrounded by yards or gardens where trees can be planted. An orchard usually is a designated area specifically for growing fruit trees and is not commonly found in residential areas. Conservation land and countryside may have trees, but they are not specifically near houses. Surface of earth is a broad and vague option that does not provide any specific context related to the question.
Forgiveness is typically associated with having a kind and compassionate nature, indicating that the person has a good heart. The other options do not fit with the concept of forgiveness - "make up" and "new freedom" are not characteristics that someone can have, "good karma" is associated with positive actions and consequences rather than personality traits, and "bad man" is the opposite of forgiving.
The question is asking for a game to play with children using a round toy. "Play ball" is a common game played with children using a round ball as the toy. The other options do not fit the criteria of using a round toy. "Play with toys" is too vague and could refer to any type of toy, while "play sports" and "throw things" do not specifically mention using a round toy. "Frisbee" is a specific toy, but it is not always in the shape of a round disc and may not be suitable for younger children.
The use of the word "big" suggests that the balloon is larger than normal, which is a common feature of balloons used in circuses. Furthermore, the phrase "floating at the top of a dome" implies that the balloon is suspended in mid-air, which is a common spectacle in circus performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a baby bottle that they packed, which indicates that they are likely traveling with a baby. The options "medicine cabinet," "grocery store," "dishwasher," and "liquor store" do not make sense in this context. "Diaper bag" is the most logical choice because it is a place where one would typically pack items for a baby when traveling with them.
The sentence describes the action of lifting a cup to take a drink and then returning the hand back to the table. The most appropriate verb to describe this action would be "set down," which means to place something gently and carefully on a surface. None of the other options fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe the action of returning the cup to the table after taking a drink.
The question is asking about a place to cook BBQ, which generally refers to a method of outdoor cooking. The option "restaurant" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it suggests that someone would go to a commercial establishment to cook their own food. "Work" and "summer" are not locations and therefore do not fit the context of the question. "Louisiana" may be known for its BBQ but it does not provide a specific location. "Backyard" is the most logical answer as it is a common location for home BBQs.
The question is asking about something that can fight off disease, which is most commonly associated with the body's immune system. The immune system is responsible for identifying and destroying harmful pathogens that can cause illness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence describes a person who is preparing to bike home, and then takes out a key, which suggests that they are likely at a location where they had to lock up their bike. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn lock." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Joe was motivated by curiosity to pursue a certain career. The option "design software" seems the most relevant as it requires curiosity and creativity to create new software designs. The other options such as "use television" and "see exhibits" do not seem to require a significant level of curiosity to pursue as a full-time career. "Read book" and "taking a walk" are not typically considered careers.
The sentence mentions that the man picked the apple from a tree outside of Chicago, so it is likely that the apple came from a nearby location. The only answer choice that is in close proximity to Chicago is Illinois, so this is the most likely correct answer. The other options, such as Washington state, a swamp or woods, are not geographically related to the sentence and do not provide any relevant information.
Lemurs are not typically associated with any religious context. Therefore, none of the options provided is a correct answer. It is important to pay attention to the context of the question and eliminate options that do not logically fit with the question's premise.
Cats are known for their love of small, enclosed spaces, such as boxes or bags. It is common knowledge that cats often try to fit into small spaces, even if they are too small for them. The options "american home," "barn," "bed," and "own home" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, making "paper bag" the most likely answer.
The sentence implies that Sarah enjoyed the scent of the roses, which is typically associated with the blossoming stage of the flower rather than when it is a closed bud (i.e., not yet open). The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as a vase or a park do not give context to the act of smelling, nor does "cast shadow" or "open" have relevance to the sentence.
The statement suggests that every individual possesses something that sets them apart from others, something that defines their individuality. Personality is often a term used to describe a person's distinctive character, behavior, and attitude traits that distinguish them from others. The other choices, such as values or experiences, may be important aspects of an individual's life but do not capture the essence of what makes everyone unique.
The sentence describes a series of disasters, indicating that something has gone wrong in multiple ways. The word "perfect" suggests that these disasters have occurred in a particularly complete or thorough way, further emphasizing the severity of the situation. "Terrible" best captures the negative tone and sense of calamity conveyed by the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity or comprehensiveness of the described disasters.
The question is asking for the "best thing" that teens can do after school, which suggests a positive and productive activity. Smoking and hanging out are not productive and may even be harmful. Homework is important, but the question is asking for something outside of academic work. Going to a movie could be enjoyable, but it may not necessarily be the "best" thing to do. Volunteering, on the other hand, is a productive and fulfilling activity that can benefit both the individual and their community.
The sentence implies that a marmot would be restricted from walking to another continent, which suggests that it is currently in captivity. The option "cage" directly refers to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not provide any context for the marmot's situation or location.
Anemones are marine animals that typically live in saltwater environments. The options "tide pool" and "sea water" are both related to marine environments, but tide pools are small bodies of water that form along rocky coastlines during low tide, and may not necessarily contain anemones. "South Pacific" is a region, and "movie scene" and "dictionary" are not related to the context of the question. Therefore, "sea water" is the most likely correct answer.
The sentence implies that the person is no longer hungry and chooses to save the remaining hamburger for later consumption. This suggests that the person has eaten a sufficient amount of food and is now "full." The other options do not provide a relevant reason for stopping to eat the hamburger. Sadness and death are unlikely to be related to food consumption, while heartburn and food poisoning may cause a person to stop eating but are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a country in North America that can grow beans for coffee, implying that the country has a suitable climate and terrain for coffee production. Mexico is well-known for its coffee farming and is one of the top producers of coffee in the world. The other options are unrelated and do not provide any information that could lead to the correct answer.
The sentence indicates that Joe was trying to be gentle when setting the cup on the table, which suggests that he was trying to avoid making any loud or disruptive sounds that could be considered a distraction. The other options are not applicable to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that traveling to many different places will result in a variety of experiences, not all of which may be enjoyable. Therefore, it is likely that the person will have interesting experiences, which is a broad term that can encompass a range of activities, sights, and interactions with people from different cultures. The other options do not logically follow from the context of the sentence - having lots of tickets or receiving compliments are not necessarily indicative of travel experiences, feeling pleasure is too general of a term, and looking attractive is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Superman has a principle that he refuses to kill, and the reason for this principle is that he holds a particular view about the value of life. The word "every" implies that Superman believes that all life is valuable, and "important" is a word commonly associated with the idea of something having great worth or significance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person believes that all information should be difficult to understand or only meant for a select few (esoteric in nature). However, the second part of the sentence suggests that this person does not like the idea of categorizing information, which would make it easier to understand and accessible to more people. The other options are all synonyms for esoteric and do not fit the meaning of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the small dog is owned by the grandmother of the speaker's father. It is common for small dogs to live indoors as pets, and the most likely place for a small dog to live in this context would be at the grandmother's home. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence contrasts the previous location, a rural area, with the current location, which is now nonstop crowded. This suggests that the new location is in a more populous and urban setting. The options "medical building" and "strip mall" could potentially be in an urban or rural area, but do not provide enough information to determine the correct answer. "City" and "metro area" also fit the context of an urban setting, but are more general terms that do not specifically refer to a specific type of location.
Plants are commonly kept on windowsills inside a house, as they require sunlight to grow and windows provide access to natural light. Plants are not typically found on the surface of the earth or on roof tiles. While a park may have plants, it is not a location within someone's house. A greenhouse is a location where plants can be grown, but it is not necessarily a feature in someone's house.
The sentence implies that Jill read the newspaper at her own residence or perhaps outside of her residence if the newspaper was delivered to her front door. The other options (subway, street, floor, and trash) do not make contextual sense because they are not typical places for reading a newspaper.
The question implies that someone is snoring, which can be a symptom of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or chronic snoring. Therefore, the correct answer is sleep disorders. The other options do not have a clear relationship to snoring. Loud noise could potentially cause someone to snore or wake them up from snoring, but it is not a likely scenario in the context of the question. Leaving the room or complaining may be a reaction to snoring, but they are not necessarily what other people could be doing. Death is an extreme and unrelated option.
The sentence suggests that the absence of an adult during a baby's bath could lead to a dangerous situation. Infants are not able to take care of themselves and can easily drown in just a few inches of water. Therefore, it is important to never leave a baby alone during bath time. The other options do not align with the potential danger of leaving a baby unattended during a bath.
Graduating high school typically marks the beginning of higher education for many Americans. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is "university." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "derby souvenirs" suggests a connection to the annual horse race known as the Derby, which is held in England. Additionally, the term "corner shop" is a term commonly used in England to refer to a small, independently run store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker was watching a film with explicit content, specifically eroticism. The word "like" in this context implies that the speaker enjoyed watching the film or found it appealing, which is a common reaction to erotic material. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - fear, enlighten, and erection may be relevant to a discussion of erotic content but are not a likely response to watching such material. Masturbation could be a possible response, but it is not the best answer given the wording of the question.
The sentence suggests that James is in a place where a speaker is addressing an audience, which is a characteristic commonly associated with an auditorium. Synagogues, groceries stores, and offices are unlikely to have a speaker addressing an audience, and confession is a religious practice that typically takes place in a private setting rather than in a public space with a speaker.
The sentence suggests that the animals in the woods became more active as evening began to fall, indicating that they are likely nocturnal animals that prefer to be active at night. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they either refer to times of day when animals are typically less active or not active at all.
The sentence implies that having access to food all the time can have negative consequences, which likely include gaining weight. Eating more calories than one burns can lead to weight gain over time. The other options are less likely to be connected to the context of the sentence: "digesting" is not a negative consequence, "not hungry" suggests a lack of consequences rather than a negative one, "swelling" may happen occasionally but is not generally a consequence of having food available all the time, and "gas" is also an unlikely consequence.
The sentence suggests that the context is storing musical instruments. A violin is a traditional orchestral instrument and would likely be stored in a music room, where other instruments are typically kept. The other options (string quartet, orchestra, band room, attic) all describe places where music is played or performed, rather than stored.
A projectile is any object that is thrown, shot or projected forward, which means it can come from a variety of sources including a canon, nerf gun, tornado, baseball or any type of weapon. The key to answering this question correctly is understanding the definition of a projectile and recognizing that it can come from multiple sources.
Playing an upright piano is typically associated with playing music in a group setting, such as a band, rather than an individual setting like a living room or house. It is also not typically associated with the college or military contexts.
The sentence suggests that the audience was learning from what they were watching, which is a common characteristic of presentations. Presentations are often educational or informative, and the audience is there to listen and learn. The other options, such as shows and concerts, may not necessarily have an educational component and the audience may be there purely for entertainment purposes.
The sentence suggests that people wanted to travel quickly, indicating a need for a mode of transportation. This makes the option "vehicles" the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence, as confessions and toilets are not related to transportation and national parks and supermarkets do not address the need for speed.
Mimicry is the ability to imitate sounds or voices, which is something parrots are well known for. In this context, the sentence suggests that parrots use mimicry to learn how to speak human words or phrases. The other options do not relate to the concept of mimicry or parrots' abilities.
The sentence suggests that reading about terrible injustices can elicit an emotional response. Getting angry is a common reaction to feeling outraged or indignant about something that is unjust. The other options, such as learning about the world or gaining insight, do not necessarily relate to an emotional response. Grief may be a possible reaction, but it is not as strongly suggested by the sentence as getting angry.
Liquor is commonly stored in a cabinet, also known as a liquor cabinet or a bar cabinet. This is because liquor needs to be stored in a cool, dark place and a cabinet allows for easy access and organization of the bottles. Fraternity houses may have liquor stored in various places, but it is not a common storage option in a typical home. Soft drinks and night stands are also not common places for liquor storage.
The sentence implies that the lack of a dish at an eatery is unusual, and suggests that the setting is likely to be a fast food restaurant where meals are typically served in disposable packaging or on trays rather than on traditional dinnerware like plates. The other choices don't provide any relevant information to help identify the location based on the given context.
The sentence suggests that Billy purchased something that can be easily carried around, as he "put them in his" backpack. Out of the given options, only a backpack is a portable item that can be used to carry things around. The other options such as classroom, kitchen sink, cabinet, and store are not suitable for carrying items like pencils around.
The term "arrest" refers to the act of taking someone into police custody, usually because the person is suspected of committing a crime. The other choices do not have any connection to the context of the question, and are not related to the concept of police custody or law enforcement.
The sentence mentions that the comforter was used constantly and treaded upon by everyone, indicating that it is a frequently used item for sleeping. Therefore, it should be placed in the bedroom. The linen closet may be a possible option for storage, but it is not the ideal place for a frequently used item. The garbage and living room options are obviously not appropriate. The washing machine may be a good location for cleaning, but not for storing the comforter.
The sentence suggests that while family is always the best for devotion, having something else in addition is also nice. The phrase "loyal friends" is commonly associated with companionship, support, and loyalty, which would complement the support provided by family. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the dusty corner caused a physical reaction in the person doing housework. Sneezing is a common response to inhaling dust and other irritants, so it is the most likely choice. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a common reaction to inhaling dust.
The sentence suggests that Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and couldn't do much else. This implies that she was likely feeling tired or fatigued, and therefore chose a low-energy activity such as watching TV. The other options are less likely, as joy would imply that she had a good day and was enjoying herself, addiction would imply a compulsive behavior that overrides feelings of fatigue, relaxation would imply a deliberate choice to unwind, and headaches would imply a physical discomfort that would likely prevent her from watching TV.
The phrase "over the top" is often used to describe behavior that is excessive or exaggerated. The word "much" is commonly used to convey a sense of excess or abundance, which is why it is the most appropriate option in this context. The other options do not convey the same sense of excessiveness as "much."
The statement suggests that the carpeting needs to withstand shoes and heavy foot traffic, which is typically a concern in areas of high use. While a gym or church may also have high foot traffic, the reference to the installation taking place in "someone's" space indicates a personal or professional location. "Home or office" is the best fit because it covers both personal and professional spaces that would require durable carpeting. "Bedroom" and "houses" do not provide enough context to make an informed choice.
Well water typically refers to water that is obtained from underground aquifers or wells that tap into them, making "ground" the most likely correct answer. While it is possible that someone could obtain water from a field or the countryside, it would likely require additional equipment or treatment to make it safe for drinking. An oil field, on the other hand, is not a likely source of well water as it typically involves the extraction of oil and gas, not water. Finally, Kansas is a specific location and does not necessarily have any relevance to the answer.
The question is asking for a characteristic of someone who wants to give assistance, which implies a desire to be useful or supportive of others. The word "helpful" directly relates to this concept and is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Listen" and "prepared" are good qualities for assisting others but do not specifically indicate a desire to provide help. "Humanity" is a vague characteristic that may or may not relate to assistance, depending on the context.
The sentence implies that there are multiple sights to see, but most people prefer the stained glass at a specific location. The options "doorway", "ancient Rome", "building", and "chapel" do not accurately describe a specific location that would feature stained glass. However, "cathedral" is a common type of religious building that often contains intricate stained glass windows, making it a likely answer.
Drums are a musical instrument that can be found in a variety of contexts, but the most likely place to find one to look at would be a music store. A symphony orchestra may have drums, but they would be part of a larger ensemble and likely not on display for viewing. A child's room may have a toy drum, but it is unlikely that this is what the question is referring to. A rock band may also have drums, but again, they would not be on display for viewing. A parade may feature drummers, but this is not a place where one could easily go to see a drum up close.
The sentence suggests that the text had no coherent meaning, indicating that it was just a sequence of words without any logical structure. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not convey the same lack of meaning or coherence. A book, for example, might be difficult to understand but would still have some structure or purpose, while hatred and fade do not relate to language or writing in the same way that analyzing or a sequence of words might.
The sentence suggests that the man was up late and using the television as a tool to help him accomplish something. The options "eye strain," "laziness," and "get smarter" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Boredom" is a possibility, but the context suggests that the man had a specific goal in mind. "Falling asleep," on the other hand, is a common reason for people to use the television late at night, as it can help to create a relaxed and drowsy environment.
The question is asking for a general description of water to someone, which suggests that the answer should be a broad and fundamental attribute of water. "Important" is the most suitable option because water is essential for all living organisms to survive and is critical for many human activities such as agriculture, industry, and transportation. The other options are either too specific or negative in their association with water.
The sentence suggests that the heifer was no longer useful to the farm, which may mean that it was either too old or unable to produce milk. In such cases, farmers usually sell the animal to make some money. Since "sanctuary farm" and "cow pasture" are not places that buy animals, they can be eliminated. "Countryside" is a generic term and does not specifically relate to the sale of animals. "Cattle ranch" may buy animals, but it is not a common practice to sell unproductive cows to ranches. Therefore, the correct answer is "slaughterhouse," which is where animals are killed and processed for food.
The sentence explicitly states that the art project required a big wooden rod, which suggests that the item is not readily available in the immediate surroundings such as a tree stump or broom closet. The options "old clock" and "old houses" are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. A hardware store is a likely place to find a variety of wooden rods in different sizes and shapes.
The sentence presents failure as the opposite of the answer, suggesting that the correct choice is a state of achievement or success. The options "completed" and "passed" suggest a one-time event, while "good at it" lacks specificity and could apply to any skill or activity. "Succeeding" and "passing" are both commonly used to describe ongoing progress and achievement, but "passing" implies a minimum standard of performance, while "succeeding" suggests a higher level of success.
The sentence mentions that the worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, which suggests that moisture is playing a role here. It is a common phenomenon for worms to come out of soil when it is wet because they need moisture to breathe. If the soil becomes too compact or dry, they cannot move or breathe properly, and hence might die. Thus, it is more likely that the worms are coming out due to the presence of wet soil rather than dry soil or other wet things. The option "start to fall" seems to be unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The options include a few different types of events, but only one of them is specifically associated with shows: the theater. A theater is a venue designed for live performances, such as plays, musicals, and comedy shows. While some of the other options may involve entertainment or performances, they do not have the same strong connection to the idea of enjoying a show as the theater does.
The question is asking where homemade food is typically stored, and the most logical option would be a container. Containers are commonly used to store food at home, whether it's in the refrigerator, freezer, or pantry. The other options, such as supermarket, jar, backpack, and Wal-Mart, do not make sense as answers since they are not typically associated with storing homemade food.
Based on the context of the sentence and the choices provided, it is likely that the question is referring to a side dish that is commonly served with a meal. Potatoes are a common side dish at steak houses, often served as mashed potatoes, French fries, or baked potatoes. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with serving food or potatoes.
Many supermarkets have started charging for plastic bags to reduce waste and promote reusable bags. This practice is becoming increasingly common around the world. Other options like a restaurant or Starbucks may also charge for a bag, but it's not as common. The options of closet and home are not relevant to the context of the question.
An airplane hangar is a large building used to store aircraft. Military bases commonly have airplane hangars to keep their aircraft safe and protected from the elements when not in use. Airport terminals are for passengers and do not typically have airplane storage facilities. The sky is not a physical location to keep an airplane.
A computer terminal is an electronic device that is used to interact with a computer system. It consists of a keyboard and a display screen, and is typically used for inputting commands and data into a computer, as well as for viewing its output. None of the other choices are relevant to the definition of a computer terminal.
The sentence suggests that the subject was known for being soft and sensitive, but in a situation where everyone's wills were tested, she stood out for being different. Being stoic means showing little emotion and not easily giving in to pressure, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options all suggest the opposite of being soft and sensitive.
The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between the presence of dance clubs and higher rates of obesity. Since the options are locations, we need to choose the one that is most likely to have both dance clubs and high rates of obesity. The United States is a large country with a diverse population that enjoys dancing and has high rates of obesity, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are too specific to be considered a general trend.
The sentence mentions a specific combination of instruments - a violin and three others - which is commonly associated with a string quartet. String quartets are often associated with classical music and are comprised of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The other options do not include this specific combination of instruments, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that if your opponents in a marathon are very fast, you may have difficulty keeping up with them and may fall behind. The word "behind" specifically means to not be in front of or to not keep up with others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Lightly" does not make sense in this context, "train" is not a verb that describes falling behind, "slowly" suggests moving at a leisurely pace, and "sitfast" is not a commonly used term.
The sentence suggests that there is a public place where people run and throw balls and it is hot enough to require fanning oneself. A sports stadium is a logical choice because it is a place where sporting events occur where people run and throw balls, and it could get very hot with all of the physical activity and body heat. Saunas and hot rooms are also hot, but they are not typically places where people run and throw balls in public. Living rooms and appliance stores would not normally have this type of activity taking place.
The sentence states that the person is looking to buy frozen food in a smaller shop, indicating that they are not looking for a large supermarket or chain store. The most likely place to find a smaller shop that sells frozen food is a local grocery store. The options of refrigerator, freezer, and fridge are not relevant as they are appliances used for storing food, not purchasing it.
The question asks for a word or phrase that describes a person who has bad luck. "Misfortune" is a commonly used term to describe someone who is experiencing bad luck or unfavorable circumstances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. "Schizophrenia" is a mental health condition, "fearful" describes a person who is afraid or anxious, "skills" pertains to abilities or competencies, and "criticism" refers to negative feedback or disapproval.
The sentence suggests that the subject was a great man who needed to maintain a certain level of grooming or appearance, which implies that the correct answer likely has to do with personal hygiene or grooming. The term "trimmed" specifically suggests hair that can be cut or styled, which again points towards hair on a person's head. The other options, such as barber shop or dog, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that getting revenge can bring people a certain feeling. "Satisfaction" is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of accomplishment or righting a wrong. "Being happy," "joy," and "ownership" are not commonly associated with revenge and therefore do not fit in the context of the sentence. "Disappointment" is the opposite of what the sentence is suggesting.
The sentence suggests that Dan is providing assistance with the intention of creating something positive for people. "Better circumstances" is the most general and broad option that could encompass a wide range of situations where someone might need assistance, such as financial, emotional, or physical. Happiness and learning new skills are more specific outcomes, while "people helped" is too vague and does not provide a clear goal for Dan's actions. Death is not a plausible option as it does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that marine life needs to shelter themselves from a shark, which indicates that the shark is a predator. Coral reefs are known to provide shelter and protection for various types of marine life, including small fish and crustaceans, which may explain why they are a viable option for sheltering oneself from a shark. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions eating popcorn while being entertained, which is commonly associated with watching movies. Movie theatres are typically known as places where people go to watch movies and enjoy snacks like popcorn. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when someone talks too much, it has a negative impact on other people. The word "cause" indicates that there is a direct relationship between the excessive talking and another negative consequence. "Dry mouth" and "upset stomach" are physical symptoms that may be caused by anxiety or nervousness, but they are not specifically related to talking too much. "Misunderstandings" suggest a breakdown in communication, which may occur if someone is not talking clearly or if the listener is not paying attention. "Headaches" are not directly related to talking too much and are less likely to be caused by a social interaction. Therefore, "distraction" is the most appropriate choice, as talking too much can be distracting to others and disrupt their ability to focus.
Small dogs are often associated with being carried around in baskets or small carriers, so it is logical to assume that they would like to live in a basket. A bathroom or animal shelter would not be appropriate living quarters for a small dog, and there is no indication that they would prefer to live in a big house or in Georgia specifically.
The phrase "board a vehicle on railing" may refer to boarding a train or other rail-based transportation, which would be done at a railway station. The other options, such as deck or porch, are not typically associated with rail transportation. A flight of stairs may be found at a railway station, but it alone does not indicate rail transportation. A bus station would be used for accessing buses, not rail-based transportation.
The question is asking for a location where doctors are known for going during their free time. While doctors may frequent places such as medical offices or schools for work-related reasons, the other locations listed (nursing home, emergency room) are not typically associated with leisure activities. The option "golf course" is a common stereotype of doctors enjoying golfing during their off time. Therefore, it is the most likely answer.
A revolving door is a common feature in hotel lobbies, as it allows for easy entrance and exit while also maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the building. It is less common in other locations such as banks or public places, which typically have standard doors or automatic sliding doors. While some apartment buildings may have revolving doors, it is not as common as in hotels, making hotel lobby the most likely answer. The mention of spending the night further supports the idea of a hotel lobby.
The sentence suggests that Bill had to increase the gain on his audio equipment due to a problem caused by the high-impedance gear he was using. The word "cause" implies that something negative was happening as a result of the equipment, which in this case was likely a loss or reduction of volume. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Bridges are structures that are built to cross over bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. Therefore, the most likely answer is "over water" because the purpose of a bridge is to provide a safe and stable path over a body of water. The other options may have bodies of water present, but they do not necessarily require a bridge in order to cross or navigate them.
The sentence suggests that the presence or ownership of a lizard is somehow related to the income of the individual in question. However, none of the choices provided offer any insight into where one might find such a lizard. Additionally, there is no clear correlation between income and the presence of a specific type of reptile. Therefore, the correct answer is "none of the above."
The word "agnostic" suggests that the person is uncertain or skeptical about the existence of a higher power or deity. The sentence suggests that the person has been studying science for a long time, which may have influenced their beliefs to the point where they have begun to lose faith. The other options, such as math or astronomy, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person studied self-help books, which are typically focused on self-improvement and personal growth. Therefore, it is likely that after studying such books, he gained a greater understanding of himself, his goals, and how to achieve them. The other options, such as inspiration and dreams, may also be possible outcomes of reading self-help books, but they are not as directly tied to the idea of gaining understanding or knowledge.
The sentence suggests that there is a certain characteristic that helps in distinguishing garbage from other things. One such characteristic is a foul, unpleasant odor that garbage often emits, hence "can smell nasty" is the correct answer. The other options do not provide a clear way to distinguish garbage from other things.
The sentence suggests that 9 is related to 3 as a multiple, which means that 9 is a product of 3 and another whole number. This is a common concept in basic arithmetic, where multiples are used to help students understand the relationships between numbers and their factors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the context is related to travel and staying overnight somewhere. Typically, hotels provide small bottles of shampoo for their guests to use during their stay. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The mention of a band suggests that the event being described was a musical performance, and the fact that the electricity went out indicates that the performance was being held indoors, possibly in a venue that relied on electricity for lighting and sound equipment. The options "building", "bedroom", "opera", and "church" do not necessarily have any connection to a musical performance, while "concert" is the most likely option given the context.
The question is asking where a potato becomes softer, indicating that it is already a potato and needs to be cooked or prepared in some way. The options "optical device," "blender," and "pantry" are clearly not related to the process of cooking or softening a potato. A garden patch is where potatoes are grown, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a potato will become softer by being in the garden. Therefore, the correct answer must be "vegetable stew," which is a dish that involves cooking vegetables, including potatoes, in liquid until they become soft and tender.
The sentence mentions that space is the most important character on a keyboard. This suggests that space has a crucial role in typing something out, and the most basic thing that one would need space for while typing is to separate individual words. The other options - paragraph, sentence, box, front - are not as basic as individual words when it comes to writing.
The sentence suggests that someone forgot their shopping bag when they went to eat. Since the bag was likely intended for carrying items from a shopping trip, it is most likely to be found at a location that is related to shopping. The options "atlantis" and "closet" are unlikely since they are not related to shopping. The option "retail store" is a possibility, but the sentence implies that the person left the bag behind when they left to eat, so they likely did not go to a retail store afterwards. This leaves "grocery store" and "restaurant" as the remaining options, but since the sentence mentions that they grabbed a bit to eat, it is more likely that the bag was left behind at the restaurant rather than the grocery store.
The context of the sentence suggests that the radio was too loud or making too much noise, since the person complained about it. The word "blaring" specifically means to make a loud, harsh, or unpleasant sound, which would fit with the idea of someone complaining about a radio. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, since they either suggest a different action the radio could be doing, or are not related to radio at all.
The sentence implies that the government can have an excess of something, and the word "sometimes" suggests that this is not always the case. The other choices, such as "Canada" and "water," do not make sense in this context. "Trouble" and "city" could be possible answers, but the word "sometimes" makes the choice of "control" more likely, as governments are often criticized for over-regulating or exerting too much control over their citizens.
When encountering a pedestrian crossing the street while driving, it is important to stop the vehicle to allow them to cross safely. Driving in reverse may create more danger and is not a recommended action. The option for "passenger" is not related to the situation of encountering a pedestrian, and "open the window" and "walking" are also not relevant.
The context of the question suggests that it is asking where it is inappropriate or unacceptable to throw garbage. It is never appropriate to throw garbage at another person, such as a friend, as it can be disrespectful and harmful. The other options listed are all surfaces or receptacles where garbage is commonly disposed of.
The sentence suggests that the central bank is taking action to combat inflation. Inflation refers to a rise in general price levels across an economy, which can lead to a decrease in purchasing power for consumers and a loss of competitiveness for businesses. In contrast, deflation refers to a decrease in general price levels, which may sound like a positive development but can lead to decreased economic activity and higher unemployment. Therefore, it makes sense for the central bank to respond to inflation by taking steps to counteract it, such as adjusting interest rates or the money supply. The other options do not reflect situations that would warrant a response from the central bank in regards to inflation.
The sentence implies that the plumbing mentioned is not related to providing drinking water. Oil refineries have plumbing systems that are primarily used for processing crude oil and other materials, and are not used for providing drinking water. The other options (wall, shower, own home, water fountain) all contain plumbing systems that are used for bringing water to a tap or shower head, and therefore could potentially be used if someone was thirsty.
The fact that the police were well liked and respected suggests that they had a positive relationship with the community. The sentence also mentions that it was easier for the police to interact with the community, which implies that the community was small enough for the police to know the residents personally. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the hall the person was lost in was very long, which implies that it was part of a large structure. Of the choices given, only "large building" fits this description. The other options do not necessarily have long halls, or if they do, do not require them to be part of a large structure.
The sentence suggests that the story featuring a koala is presented through colorful pages, which is a characteristic commonly associated with children's books. The fact that the parent thinks it made for a good book further supports this idea. The other options, such as a movie or the Australian outback, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The other options do not involve print media, which is indicated by the phrase "in print form." The internet, car, and television are all electronic mediums, while books can be in print but are not typically associated with current events. Newspapers are a common source of current event information that are available in print form.
The sentence suggests that the item being described has a pocket specifically designed to hold a hydration pack filled with water. The only option that makes sense in this context is the backpack, as it is common for hiking and outdoor backpacks to have a compartment or pocket for a hydration system. The other options are unrelated to the context and have no clear connection to hydration or water.
The sentence suggests that even if goals are reduced, failure can still occur if there is some kind of illusion or false belief about the situation. Lowering expectations or holding back may actually help prevent failure, so these options can be eliminated. "Die in a fiery car crash" is a completely unrelated option that can also be ruled out. "Amount to nothing" could be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "illusion" in the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a location where there are millions of jellyfish. Jellyfish are often found in bodies of water, such as the ocean or sea. The term "smack" is sometimes used to refer to a group of jellyfish, but it is not a location. Sponge Bob's house is a fictional location and not a place where jellyfish would be found. The store is not a location where jellyfish are typically found. Therefore, the correct answer is sea water.
Dog shows are events where owners showcase their dogs and compete for various awards. Part of the competition includes the appearance and grooming of the dogs. Therefore, it is likely that a small dog would be well-groomed at a dog show. The other options do not provide any context that would suggest the dog would be well-groomed there.
The sentence suggests that the people talking during the movie were causing a negative effect for others. Distraction is the most likely option because talking during a movie can be distracting for those trying to watch it. Headaches and sore throat are unlikely because they do not align with the context of the sentence. Misunderstandings and cell phone are also unlikely because they do not fit the context of the sentence either.
Halloween is often associated with spooky and supernatural themes, including ghosts and spirits. Haunted houses are a common Halloween attraction and are designed to create a spooky and eerie atmosphere, making them a likely place to find spirits on Halloween. The other options are not typically associated with Halloween or spirits.
The question asks for the location of the closest dining table not in the person's home. The options "conference" and "card room" do not typically have dining tables, while the "living room" may have one but it would still be in the person's house. The "white house" is unrelated to the context of the question. The most likely option left is the "neighbor's house," as it suggests a location outside of the person's home where a dining table would be present.
The sentence suggests that the mom was in a hurry and did not have time to wait for the child to eat slowly. Therefore, the child had to eat quickly in order to satisfy their hunger before leaving. The other choices do not logically follow from the context of the sentence.
The question asks for the country where the Andes Mountains alphabetically starts popping up. Argentina is the first country alphabetically that the Andes Mountains pop up through. The other answer options are alphabetically after Argentina.
Tying a ribbon around a gift box is a common and popular practice when giving presents. Floral arrangements may have ribbons around them, but it is not as common as tying ribbons around gift boxes. Tying a ribbon around a girl's hair is possible, but it is not as common as tying a ribbon around a gift box. Tying a ribbon around a car or typewriter does not make much sense in the context of giving presents.
The mention of a "stone arch" suggests that the question is referring to architectural or engineering feats. The use of the word "ancient" further narrows down the possible choices to civilizations that existed long ago. Of the given choices, only ancient Rome is known for its intricate and impressive feats of engineering and architecture, including famous stone arches such as the Arch of Titus and the Arch of Constantine. The other choices (foot, cathedral, building, my bathroom) do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Milking machines are commonly used in agricultural settings, particularly in barns where cows are milked. The other options, such as an office or a bar, do not have any clear association with milking machines. Industrial areas may be a possibility, but it is still more likely that a milking machine would be found in a barn where cows are kept. A museum may display historical milking machines, but it is unlikely that they would actually be used there.
The context suggests that the star is lonely and wishing to be a part of something. It is most likely referring to a group or pattern of stars, which is what a constellation is. Hollywood, atmosphere, and solar system do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Night sky could potentially fit, but it doesn't convey a sense of belonging in the way that constellation does.
The use of the word "analyzed" suggests a more formal setting, and out of the given choices, a university is the most likely place for someone to be analyzed or studied in an academic context. The other options do not have a clear connection to a formal academic setting. A bookstore and speakeasy are unlikely places for a formal analysis of a poet's work to be happening, while home and classroom are not specific enough to determine if it's a formal setting or not.
The sentence suggests that a teacher is trying to teach or share something with their class. The phrase "better knowledge" implies that the teacher is attempting to improve the students' understanding or increase their knowledge on a particular topic. The other options do not fit the context of a teacher trying to impart knowledge to their class. "Group students" and "time test" do not make sense in this context, and "suffering" and "state facts" do not imply the goal of teaching or sharing knowledge.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is strong and morally upright, which makes it likely that they would want to protect someone who is weaker or in need of protection. The word "weak" directly contrasts with the idea of strength, and the other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence. Batman is a fictional character and not relevant to the sentence, while "diluted," "fragile," and "regular" don't provide clear criteria for who needs protection.
The sentence refers to the origin of slaves during the time of European slavery, suggesting that they were taken from a specific location. "South" likely refers to the African continent, which was a major source of slaves for European countries during this time period. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not relevant to the topic of slavery or the transportation of slaves.
The context of the sentence implies that there are advantages to learning a language specifically for business settings. One of the main benefits of learning a language for business is that it can significantly improve communication with foreign clients or partners. This can lead to greater success in negotiations and a more collaborative relationship overall. The other options (happiness, problems, confidence, comfortness) do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, and are less likely to be a primary reason for learning a language for business.
The sentence suggests that the kids were enthusiastic about getting ready and getting in the car, which implies that they were excited about going somewhere. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - expressing information, dancing, going to the library or fixing the car are not activities that would typically elicit excitement from kids getting ready to leave the house.
The question suggests that the student is looking for the answer to a question they do not know. Out of all the options, searching on the internet is the most likely way to quickly find the answer to a question. The other options do not give any direction on how to find the answer to the question, as completing the test or learning to read won't necessarily help with finding the answer to the specific question. Asking questions or reading a book may be helpful, but searching on the internet can often provide faster and more direct results.
Learning is an active process that involves deliberate effort to acquire new knowledge, skills, or abilities. Study refers to the act of applying oneself to acquire knowledge or understanding of a particular subject or topic by reading, researching, or practicing. Attention and thought are necessary for learning, but they do not necessarily involve the active process of studying. Exposure may lead to learning, but it is not as direct or intentional as studying.
The sentence implies that authors have a strong emotional reaction when they finish something related to writing. The phrase "complete writing" suggests that the authors have finished writing either a book, a story, or an article, and they feel a range of emotions from relief to happiness. The other answer choices do not convey the same meaning and are not in line with the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where there are likely to be multiple desk drawers, indicating that the answer needs to be a location where desks are often found with more than one drawer. The options "holding office supplies," "room," "office," and "school" do not necessarily imply the presence of desks or drawers, whereas "desk" specifically refers to a piece of furniture with drawers used for work or study.
The sentence suggests that the generals are looking to drop bombs from above, which is typically done using an aircraft. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that loneliness is a common problem among residents in facilities for the elderly, and therefore they are likely in need of some form of social engagement or interaction. The other options, such as plants or respiration, do not directly address the issue of loneliness and would not necessarily alleviate the problem. Additionally, the options expiration and perspiration do not make sense in the context of the question.
The question suggests that the act of killing someone is seen as a negative action that may be followed by negative consequences. A common emotional response to taking another person's life is a feeling of guilt, which may be amplified if the person is seen as a "good" or moral individual. The other options (Michigan, dies, being imprisoned, bloody mess) do not relate to the expected emotional response after committing such an act.
The sentence suggests that the woman was reflecting on her failures in life and her emotional state as a result of this reflection was likely negative. Depression is a common emotional response to feelings of failure or disappointment. The other options, such as knowledge or confused, are not typically associated with emotional responses to personal failures.
Discovering truth is often the ultimate goal of research, which usually occurs at the conclusion of the process. This is when the researcher has gathered and analyzed all of their data, weighed the evidence, and drawn their conclusions. The other options do not have a clear connection to the process of research or the goal of discovering truth.
The sentence implies that the elderly person needs assistance pulling themselves up from a certain area in their home, which suggests that the area is not on the ground level. Stairwells are commonly found in homes with multiple levels and are a likely candidate for where an elderly person may need to install a railing for support. Decks and houses may also require railings for safety, but not necessarily for assistance in pulling oneself up. Feet is not a logical answer as it is a body part rather than an installation, and a flight of stairs is too vague and could refer to any set of stairs.
A beam is a structural element used in construction, typically made of wood or steel. It is often created on a construction site as part of the building process. The other options, such as ceiling or train station, may have beams present, but they are not typically created at those locations. Large buildings and warehouses may have been built with beams, but they would not be created there.
The sentence suggests that John was instructed to do something specific in order to improve his health, which is likely related to his blood pressure. Relaxing, lying back and sleeping may be methods to lower blood pressure, but they may not be the specific instruction that John was given. Feeling happy is not necessarily related to blood pressure, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the receptionist lady works in an office setting, as she uses a rubber stamp on her notes. The other options (art class, indiana, insane asylum) do not have any clear connection to the use of a rubber stamp in an office setting. The word "desk" could potentially be a correct answer, as it is also associated with an office setting, but it is less likely than "office" as it is too specific and narrow in scope.
The sentence suggests that the person hit the bottle with force, enough to cause pain in their hand. It is likely that the impact would also cause the bottle to break. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people of faith believe that the human body is a vessel for the soul, which is a concept commonly associated with various religions. The human body is often viewed as a temporary home for the soul, which will eventually leave the body after death. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was able to see their idea come to life, which is likely to be a fulfilling and satisfying experience. The other options do not match the positive tone of the sentence and are therefore not likely to be the correct answer. "Sad" is unlikely as it is the opposite of what one would feel when experiencing their idea becoming a reality. "Very nice" and "inspiration" are too vague and do not capture the emotional state of the person accurately. "Make money" is not mentioned in the sentence and is therefore not relevant.
The sentence states that John runs a "small corner shop", which implies that the shop is located on a street corner. This means that the correct answer is "street corner", while the other options do not have any relevance to the location of the shop.
The sentence suggests that the movies being referred to are trying to achieve a specific goal, which is to provide enjoyment to the audience through unexpected and lighthearted events. The word "entertaining" is the most appropriate choice to describe this intention. The other options, such as "clever," "excellent," and "watched by people," do not directly relate to the tone or content of the movies being described. While the movies may be intended to be "funny," this term does not capture the full range of what they are trying to achieve.
Contraceptives are typically sold at drug stores or pharmacies, as they are over-the-counter products that do not require a prescription. Medicine cabinets are not a place to purchase contraceptives, as they are typically only used to store medications that have already been purchased. A doctor's office may prescribe contraceptives, but they do not typically sell them directly to patients. The option "vagina" is not a place to purchase contraceptives, as they are not sold directly through the body.
When someone is experiencing strong emotions, such as sadness or joy, their body can produce tears. This is commonly referred to as "tearing up" or "crying" and is a natural physiological response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that watching a favorite show is a way to unwind after a tiring day. The options "smile," "buy tickets," "laugh," and "succeed" do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the act of relaxing.
The question is asking about the benefits of learning about a subject. Learning about a subject can help individuals advance their knowledge and understanding in that area, allowing them to potentially excel in that field. The other options do not make logical sense in answering the question, as forming opinions and changing can be subjective, headaches are not a benefit, and starting reproduction is not relevant to learning about a subject.
The sentence implies that the group of friends have gathered together after reading a book, which suggests that they may want to talk about the book and share their thoughts and opinions. The word "discussion" best describes an activity that involves exchanging ideas and thoughts with others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "learn things" and "learning" are vague and not specific to the situation, "fit" does not relate to the book or the gathering, and "nightmares" is not a likely outcome of a book discussion.
The sentence suggests that Josh was feeling hungry and needed to satisfy his hunger. The most likely option for him to do in this situation would be to go to a restaurant where he can buy food. The other options, such as bringing home fish or making bread, would require more preparation and may not be possible or practical in that moment. Going to the market or cooking dinner would also take more time and effort than simply going to a restaurant.
Hats are typically worn on the head. The other options do not correspond to the location where hats are worn.
The use of the word "couples" suggests that the context is about a movie that is geared towards both men and women, rather than something more specifically aimed at one gender. The phrase "mostly couples" implies that the movie is something that both partners can enjoy together, rather than being solely focused on the preferences of one gender. The other options are all sexual in nature and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to place their chesterfield (a type of sofa) near their magazine rack, which is typically found in a living room. Ashtrays are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and a museum or foyer would not typically have a personal chesterfield and magazine rack. Derbyshire is a location and not a piece of furniture.
The sentence suggests that the trainer is instructing the person to continue doing a specific exercise until they reach a certain point, which seems to be getting tired. This could indicate that the exercise is meant to be challenging or endurance-building, and continuing until tiredness is a sign that progress is being made. The other options do not necessarily relate to this context, and could be seen as distracting or irrelevant to the sentence.
The question is asking about what teachers often do after teaching a lesson, suggesting that there is a common practice or routine. The option "answering questions" is the most likely choice, as teachers typically allow students to ask questions after a lesson to clarify any confusion or reinforce the material taught. The other options, such as "pop quiz" or "teach children," do not necessarily follow the pattern of what teachers do after teaching a lesson.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker lives in a small town and is looking for a nice place to eat. The most logical option would be a restaurant, as dining rooms and shopping areas may not necessarily have high-quality restaurants. Mars is clearly not a viable option for dining out, and big cities may not be accessible or desirable for someone living in a small town.
When people are deciding what to buy at a shop, they often compare prices of different items to determine which one offers the best value for their money. This helps them make a more informed decision based on their budget and the quality of the product they are interested in buying. "Spending of money" and "purchasing" are too general and could apply to any aspect of shopping, while "have fun" and "splurge" are more focused on the experience of shopping rather than the decision-making process.
The cartridge of a bullet is the part that contains the bullet, gunpowder, and primer. The casing is the outer metal shell that holds everything together and is usually made of brass or other metals. The other options are not related to the cartridge of a bullet, with bandolier being a type of ammunition holder, gun shop being a place that sells guns, magazine being a device that holds multiple cartridges, and gunpowder being a component inside the cartridge.
The sentence suggests that the grain-seller required a place for storage that is dry, which leads to the conclusion that the correct answer should be something different from "wet". While "pantry" and "storage closet" are both possible options for dry storage, the word "building" is too broad and does not specifically suggest a dry storage environment. Therefore, "warehouse" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a large, enclosed storage area that can protect the grains from moisture while allowing for easier access and organization.
The question suggests that flirting has a positive outcome, and the phrase "primal basics" indicates a natural or instinctual reaction. "Sparks fly" is a common expression used to describe the excitement and chemistry between two people who are attracted to each other. The other options do not have the same positive connotation or relationship to flirting.
The sentence suggests that shower curtains are commonly used in a certain location, which is likely to be a place where many people stay temporarily. Hotels are a common location where shower curtains would be used in multiple rooms, while options like police station or dime store do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that a drug dealer engages in the act of selling drugs. While they may also supply drugs, this option is not as commonly used as "selling" drugs. The mention of prison and jail may suggest that drug dealing is an illegal activity, so it is more likely that the dealer would frequent areas where they can sell drugs discreetly. A nightclub is less likely to be a location where drug dealing takes place openly or easily.
The sentence suggests that Dave is discussing punishment and is opposed to punishing someone for making a mistake. The word "just" indicates that he believes the punishment would be unfair or unjust. The choices "hatred," "feel sorry for," "feel guilty," and "funny" are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not convey the meaning of being opposed to punishment. "Retribution" is the only choice that specifically refers to punishment for wrongdoing.
This question refers to an old social custom where men were expected to walk on the outer edge of a sidewalk when walking with a lady. This was done to protect the lady from passing carriages or other dangers that may have been present on the street. The other options such as gods, boys, female group, and father do not have any relevant connection to this social custom.
A floating cottage is a type of houseboat that can typically be found in rural areas with bodies of water such as lakes or rivers. The other options - fairy story, desert, village, and mountains - do not provide a suitable setting for a floating cottage. A fairy story might include magical elements, but a floating cottage doesn't fit the traditional motifs of most fairy stories. A desert, with its lack of water, would not be a suitable environment for a floating cottage. A village might have a river or lake nearby, but it's less likely to have houseboats. And while a mountain lake may exist, the climate and terrain don't lend themselves to houseboats. Rural areas are usually the best bet.
The sentence suggests that older stars in the outer regions of a galaxy form groups. The term "globular cluster" is commonly used in astronomy to describe such groups of stars. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "night sky," "black hole," and "heavens" are broad terms that do not relate specifically to older stars or their grouping. "Press conference" is completely unrelated to astronomy.
A bishop is a term commonly used in the religious context, particularly in Christianity. In this context, a bishop is a high-ranking member of the church hierarchy who oversees a certain geographic area or diocese. Since the question is asking about how a bishop moves from one place to another, it is logical to assume that the term "move" refers to the bishop's official travel within their diocese. In this context, the correct answer would be "church" as bishops often travel from one church to another within their diocese to conduct services or meet with their clergy. The other options are not relevant to this religious context.
The sentence suggests that the farmer is gaining more land, which implies that they will have more space to grow crops or raise livestock. This would allow them to produce more and potentially increase their profits, leading to the expected positive consequence of making more money. The other options do not make logical sense as a positive consequence of gaining more land. Disputes, more work, more responsibility, and higher taxes would all be negative consequences.
The sentence mentions a warning about burning one's hand on the handle of a small, high-walled vessel. This generally describes a saucepan, which is commonly used for cooking on a stovetop. The other options do not have handles that are typically high-walled or require a warning about potential burns.
Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day because it gives the body the energy it needs to start the day. By eating breakfast, individuals are providing their bodies with necessary nutrients and fuel that can help them feel more energized and alert. The other options do not accurately reflect the purpose of breakfast, as the focus is more on satisfying hunger or indulging in food rather than providing energy for the day.
Jumping rope is a physical activity that involves repeated impact on the feet, ankles, and legs. An ankle sprain is a common injury resulting from jumping rope, as the constant jumping and landing can put a lot of stress on the ankle joint. Looking silly, sweating, high cholesterol, and becoming tired may be results of jumping rope, but they are not injuries.
Cats have a highly developed sense of sight, especially in low light conditions, due to their large pupils and reflective tapetum lucidum layer in their eyes. This allows them to see in the dark much better than humans can. Therefore, the most likely feature of a cat that can be seen in the dark would be their eyes. The other options, such as litter of kittens, four legs, nose, and flippers do not have any clear connection to the characteristics of cats that would be visible in the dark.
A "walk-in type wardrobe" generally refers to a large, separate closet area that one can walk into and browse clothing racks and shelves. This type of wardrobe is more commonly found in larger homes or mansions, where space is not as much of an issue. Recreational vehicles and clothes cupboards are unlikely to have this type of feature, and a regular house or bedroom may or may not have a walk-in wardrobe depending on the size and design.
The sentence implies that Bobby found the lamp in a place where he had been sleeping, which suggests that the lamp was most likely located in his bedroom. The other options (building, house, store, ocean) do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to find a lamp beside oneself after waking up.
The sentence suggests that Joe was keeping his school books in a place where he could easily access them when he wanted to study, which implies that the location was in his home. The options "cabinet," "school building," "bank," and "bookstore" do not fit this context, as they are all separate places from Joe's home. Therefore, the most probable location where Joe's shelf would be placed is his bedroom.
The sentence implies that the man was in a hurry, which suggests that he had a destination or goal in mind. The options "run away" and "accident" both suggest negative circumstances, which do not fit the context of the sentence. "Pleasure" is unlikely because the sentence does not suggest that the man was enjoying himself, and "falling down" is not a logical consequence of riding a bike quickly. Therefore, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable choice.
The context of the sentence suggests that the doctor's were trying to decipher something related to the mental patient's confusion, which is a symptom commonly associated with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The other options, such as class, war, and opera, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be correct answers. The meaning of life may seem like a plausible option, but it is not directly related to the mental patient's confusion in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that having a baby can lead to stress due to the baby crying. Crying is a common behavior of newborns, which can lead to sleep deprivation and other stressors for new parents. While the other options may also be associated with starting a family, they do not directly relate to the issue of crying babies that the sentence presents.
The sentence implies that the family preferred a carpeted living space, which is most commonly found in bedrooms. Carpeting is less common in other areas, such as the gym or near the fireplace, where hard flooring may be more practical. Istanbul, being a location, is not relevant to the sentence. Houses is too broad and does not specify where the carpet was placed.
Going into a trance is often associated with altered states of consciousness and spiritual experiences. A mystical experience refers to a sense of unity or connectedness with the universe, a feeling of being at one with everything around you. This is a common outcome of trance states, which may include meditation, hypnosis or drug-induced altered states. Confusion, sleepwalking, and memory loss are not typically associated with trance states, while peacefulness may be a possibility, but not as closely related as a mystical experience.
The sentence suggests that the person was using the dictionary as a makeshift support for a table that was wobbly. It is common for people to put objects like books or dictionaries under wobbly table legs to stabilize them. The other options are not mentioned in the sentence and do not have any clear connection to the context.
The fact that the house had expensive insurance suggests that there was a high risk of damage or loss. The mention of an established history of flooding further supports this idea. Flooding commonly occurs in basements, especially in areas that are prone to heavy rain or near bodies of water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the files are still being worked on, so they need to be easily accessible. Desks and filing cabinets are common places to keep current files, as they are easily reachable and can be organized in a way that makes sense for the work being done. Hard disks, drawers, and computers may be used to store files, but they are not specifically designed for easy access while actively working on them.
The sentence suggests that people add sugar to a certain black beverage, which is a common practice for coffee. Coffee is a popular beverage that is often consumed with sugar to balance its bitterness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "punishing" suggests that the work schedule is difficult and demanding, which can lead to stress. Stress is a common response to work overload and can result in a range of physical and emotional symptoms. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence or are extreme outcomes that may not necessarily be the result of a punishing work schedule.
The sentence suggests that the employees were complaining about a lack of air conditioning in their workplace, which would most likely be an office. The other options (tables, movie theatre, car, house) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "energy" suggests that the question is asking about a physical state rather than a scientific concept. When we run out of energy, we typically feel tired and lacking in physical strength, which is commonly referred to as fatigue. The other options (matter, mass) are scientific concepts that do not relate to the physical state of being tired. Deprived and weakness are closer in meaning to fatigue, but they do not accurately capture the specific sensation of feeling physically drained.
Mildew is a type of fungus that grows in damp environments. A shower stall is an area of the bathroom that is often damp and humid, which makes it a prime location for mildew growth. Toenails, mushrooms, cave, and basement do not have the necessary moisture and humidity that mildew requires to grow, so they are less likely to be a common location for mildew.
The word "following" suggests that the police are starting a process after a crime has been committed. Since the question is asking what the police are "likely to begin," it suggests that the answer is the first step in the process of addressing the crime. "Man hunt," "punishment," "going to jail," and "retribution" are all steps that may happen after the police have completed their investigation, while "investigation" is the logical first step in understanding the circumstances of the crime.
The sentence suggests that the child needs to pass the time quietly, which implies an activity that is not particularly active or noisy. The option "read book" fits this description, as it is a quiet and solitary activity that can keep a child occupied for long periods of time. The other options do not fit this description - "brood" implies a negative and introspective state of mind, "become adult" is not an activity but a gradual process of growing up, "ask questions" may require interaction with others and therefore may not be quiet, and "clean room" may require physical activity and make some noise.
The sentence suggests that the individuals are planning a road trip that will take them across a country or region. The option "united states" is the most fitting choice as it is a well-known country with a vast network of highways that can take travelers across the entire nation. The other options do not provide a clear indication of where the road trip is taking place or which highways will be used.
The word "cast aside" suggests that the context is negative or detrimental to freedom. Slavery and captivity are both forms of oppression and are more directly related to the restriction of freedom rather than its cast-aside nature. "Evil" and "good" are too vague to be a clear answer. Communism is historically associated with oppressive regimes that prioritize the state over the individual, which can lead to restrictions on personal freedoms.
The sentence suggests that the religious man is talking about his personal relationship with faith, indicating that it is something that he has gone through or felt, rather than just believed in intellectually. The use of the word "only" also implies that this is something unique to the individual, not something that can be shared or taught. "Dream" and "light way" do not have a clear connection to the concept of faith, and "belief" and "trust" suggest a more intellectual or abstract understanding of faith rather than a personal experience of it.
The context of this sentence suggests that the surgeons were performing an operation in a medical setting, as blood is commonly associated with surgical procedures. The option "person" is the most likely answer, as surgeries are typically done on human patients. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that a cat is a carnivore, which means that they primarily eat meat. This knowledge helps eliminate the choices "get wet," "wool sweater," and "sharp claws" as they are not related to the diet of a cat. The correct choice is "eat vegetables" as it directly contradicts with the fact that a cat is a carnivore since they do not eat vegetables. The final option, "hunt prey," is not the correct answer as it is actually a behavior that is associated with being a carnivore.
A department store typically offers a wide range of products including clothing, accessories, home decor, and electronics, making it a good option for finding a gift for someone you barely know. Specialty stores usually focus on a specific type of product or theme, which may not necessarily be what the person is interested in. A Christmas tree and lost and found have no relevance to finding a gift, and a party may not necessarily have any options for a gift.
The context of the sentence suggests that the membrane being referred to is a cell membrane. Cell membranes are often observed through magnification as they are too small to be seen with the naked eye. The membrane serves to protect the cell and regulate the entry and exit of substances, which is why it is a crucial component of a cell. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Divorce legally ends a marriage, making the individual's current status single. While divorce can be a difficult and emotionally taxing experience, the other options listed do not accurately describe one's marital status after a divorce.
A keyboard is a musical instrument, so it would make sense to look for one at a music store. An office or school would not typically have musical instruments available. The classifieds or online marketplaces may have used or secondhand keyboards available, but a music store would be the most reliable option for purchasing a new keyboard. A landfill would not be a place to acquire a keyboard.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place where they can buy clothes as well as other things, which is a characteristic commonly associated with malls. Malls typically have a variety of stores, including clothing stores, as well as restaurants, entertainment options, and other stores selling a variety of goods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that canals are a prominent feature of a location in Northern Europe, which is a characteristic commonly associated with Amsterdam. Amsterdam is known for its intricate network of canals, which serve as an important part of the city's transportation system and are also popular tourist attractions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that James needed to purchase a new lamp, which suggests that he would need to go to a place where lamps are sold. A store is a common location for purchasing household items such as lamps, while the other choices do not necessarily have a direct connection to purchasing a lamp.
A "master control" is likely a central hub for controlling and monitoring various technological systems within a company. The most likely place for this hub to be located is the main office, as this is where the majority of a company's administrative and managerial functions are typically carried out. The other options, such as a beach or basement, are unlikely locations for a master control hub.
The phrase "hitting the bottle" is commonly used to refer to excessive drinking of alcohol. Therefore, if a person spends a lot of time "hitting the bottle" it can be inferred that they may have a problem with alcohol consumption, which is a characteristic associated with alcoholism. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the phrase and are not related to excessive drinking.
In a court trial, a group of people known as the jury is responsible for reviewing evidence and deliberating on a verdict. They then pass a sentence based on the verdict they have arrived at. The other options (such as "sure," "judgemental," and "mom") do not have any connection to the function of a court or the legal system.
The sentence implies that the other person is able to predict the speaker's moves in chess, indicating a level of strategic planning. The phrase "think ahead" is commonly used in chess to refer to anticipating future moves and considering possible outcomes. The other options do not relate to chess strategy or planning.
The presence of a large trash can suggests that the building is likely in an area where there is a lot of garbage generated, such as a parking lot. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. For example, a subway station may have trash cans, but they are typically smaller and spread out along the platform, rather than in front of a single building.
The sentence implies that the person's behavior caused embarrassment to themselves and their family. The word "shameful" is often used to describe actions or behavior that are deemed inappropriate or unacceptable in social situations, and would likely result in feelings of embarrassment, guilt or remorse. The other options do not convey the same meaning as the context of the sentence.
Pregnancy is often associated with weight gain and fatigue, which could cause someone to go to bed early. Additionally, hormonal changes can stimulate appetite and lead to increased calorie intake. The other options are less likely to cause weight gain and early bedtime. Drowsiness and sleeping in could be signs of fatigue, but do not necessarily lead to weight gain. Insomnia typically causes sleeplessness, not earlier bedtimes. Exercise may lead to weight loss and improved sleep patterns.
The question asks about the goal of the activities of students, which implies that there is a purpose or objective behind these activities. The phrase "better comprehension" suggests that these activities are designed to help students gain a better understanding of a particular subject or topic. The other options are possible goals for students, but they do not necessarily address the broader objective of improving comprehension.
The sentence suggests that the victim is being held captive by a twisted kidnapper who has made a deal with them. The only way for the victim to gain something seems to be by killing someone, which implies that the kidnapper is offering them a way to escape or gain their freedom. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the concept of someone being held captive or needing to kill someone to gain something.
The sentence suggests that attending a lecture given by an expert will result in something positive. The options "inspiration," "getting bored," and "drowsiness" are unlikely to be positive outcomes of attending a lecture given by an expert, while "gaining knowledge" is a common expectation of attending a lecture. Therefore, the correct answer is "gaining knowledge."
The sentence suggests that the boy had a flaw or vulnerability that the villain was able to use against him, which points to the correct answer being "weakness". "Definitely" and "will" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, while "wont" is a less common and less relevant word choice.
The sentence mentions an electric motor and a keyboard, which are both features commonly associated with electric typewriters. Electric fans, drum sanders, electric refrigerators, and electric locomotives do not typically use keyboards or have a connection to writing or printing, making them unlikely answers.
The sentence suggests that most people don't say what they mean and that they twist their words to avoid conflict. This behavior can be described as dishonest or deceptive, which is commonly associated with lying. The other options, such as setting a table, thinking, reading books, and not speaking, are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide an appropriate answer.
When traveling by air, passengers typically check their luggage and it is stored in the baggage compartment of the airplane. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the storage of luggage during air travel.
The sentence suggests that a flask is a type of container, and the word "hold" implies that something is intended to be placed inside it. Among the choices given, "liquid" is the most likely option for what a flask would be designed to hold. The other choices, such as "fire," "garage," or "contain food," do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the irregular shape of the shelf could potentially be a hazard in high-traffic areas. This implies that the shelf should be placed in a location where it is less likely to be bumped into or obstruct the flow of foot traffic. A corner location would allow the shelf to be out of the way, but still accessible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Alexa needs money to obtain food since she left her wallet at home. John gives her a twenty-dollar bill to enable her to purchase food, which is the most likely option among the choices provided. The other options, such as borrowing, having, or preparing food, suggest alternative ways of obtaining food that do not require money.
The sentence indicates that Jamie had never played an instrument before and that starting to fiddle was an exciting thing for her. This suggests that the answer is related to the experience of discovering something new. Dancing, being happy, and square dancing are not directly related to the context in the sentence. A snapped fiddle string may have been frustrating or disappointing, but it does not fit the description of something that Jamie found thrilling.
The options suggest different places where tickets might be used, and the most common place to put a ticket would be in a person's hand to show proof of admission or purchase. At an amusement park, movie theater, train station, or baseball stadium, a ticket may be required to enter or access certain areas. However, simply having a ticket does not guarantee entry without it being presented to an attendant or scanned. Therefore, the correct answer would be a person's hand where the ticket can be easily accessed and presented when needed.
The question is asking for a religious practice or action that a Christian might do in response to receiving what they needed. "Thank god" is a common expression of gratitude to a higher power in Christianity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the women were working in a setting where selling beer was a possibility, and that they were using their sex appeal to help sell the product. This is a common marketing tactic used in the beer industry, where attractive women are sometimes used to promote the product. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
In most cases, alcohol is served in a mug at a bar, which is a place that specializes in serving alcoholic beverages. A juice bar typically only serves non-alcoholic drinks, and a store or cupboard would not be a typical location for serving alcohol. A cabinet may refer to a type of furniture or storage unit, but it is not a location where one would typically be served alcohol.
The sentence suggests that the person had a strong dislike for hospitals, which may indicate that they preferred to be in a different environment for the end of their life. The option "die at home" aligns with this preference and is a common wish for those who want to spend their final moments in a familiar and comfortable setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a behavior that people exhibit when they do not like each other. "Part company" is a common phrase used to describe the action of separating from someone when a relationship is no longer amicable. The other options do not fit the context of the question and are unlikely behaviors when two people do not like each other.
The sentence implies that Joe had access to a rented locker, which is a commodity usually associated with hotels. Bus depots and airports may also offer locker rentals, but they are not as commonly recognized for this service as hotels. "Own home" and "pocket" are unlikely choices because it is not usual to rent a locker in your own home or carry a locker key in your pocket. "Idea" is not related to the question and is not a viable choice.
The purpose of a shopping basket is to carry goods while shopping. It is a convenient and lightweight option for carrying smaller items that do not require a cart. The other options are related to the context of shopping, but do not specifically address the purpose of a shopping basket.
Using a glass is a common way to drink something politely or formally. Glassware is often used in formal settings, such as at weddings or fancy dinners. The other options do not make sense in the context of drinking politely or formally - opening your mouth is not an appropriate vessel, eating first is unrelated, buying alcohol is irrelevant if the question is about drinking politely, and a coffee mug is not generally used in formal settings.

In baseball, a missed swing is typically referred to as a strike, which is one of the ways a batter can be called out. The other options do not accurately describe the situation of missing a swing in baseball. Injury, agony, sore muscles, and pain may all occur as a result of playing the sport, but they are not specifically related to missing a swing.
The Danube river passes through multiple countries, including Austria, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Croatia). However, the question asks for the current country that contains the river, and Austria is the only option that is currently a country and contains a section of the Danube. Czechoslovakia is no longer a country, and the Nile is a river in Africa, not Europe.
The context of the question refers to the French Revolution, a turbulent time in French history characterized by radical political and social upheaval. The use of the term "cut through royal necks" suggests a violent and deadly approach to punishing those in power. The guillotine was famously used during the French Revolution to execute thousands of individuals, including King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette. The other options do not align with the context of the question or historical knowledge of the French Revolution.
The sentence indicates that the student was experiencing difficulty with finding information in the book, which implies that they are seeking help or clarification. In an academic setting, it is common for students to raise their hand and ask questions when they do not fully understand a concept or are struggling with a task. This makes "ask questions" the most logical answer choice. "Learn" is not a specific action that serves to address the student's problem, "turn pages" is not necessarily helpful in finding specific information, "death" is completely irrelevant to the context, and "go to school" is too general and doesn't address the specific issue.
The sentence suggests that while James and Ruth's divorce was not acrimonious, it was still a difficult and emotional experience. The use of the word "amicable" implies that there was not a lot of bitterness or anger involved, but the description of the situation as "not happy" suggests that both parties were likely feeling sad or upset about the end of their marriage. The other options may also be applicable to a divorce, but do not fit as well with the specific language used in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Danny wants to improve the appearance of his floor, which often involves covering it with a material that is aesthetically pleasing, like carpet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A tennis game requires a tennis court and the only option that mentions a tennis court is "field with tennis court." "Match" and "progress" do not refer to a location, while "park" and "highschool" do not specify if they have tennis courts. Therefore, "field with tennis court" is the correct choice.
The sentence suggests that the person has a wound that requires urgent care. Urgent care is a medical treatment that requires immediate attention, which would logically lead an individual to go to the emergency room. The hospital option is a vague option as different hospitals have different departments and services. Body and patient are not locations and injury does not provide any clear direction as to where to go.
The word "dull" implies boredom or lack of interest. If something is fixed, it would become more engaging and captivating, hence "interesting" would be the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of something being "dull". "Sharp" could make sense if something was physically dull, like a knife or a blade, but in this case, it is unclear what is being referred to.
The sentence implies that the person had a positive experience at the restaurant, and upon returning home, he did something to express his satisfaction. The most common way to do this is by leaving a good review on a website, such as Yelp or Google Reviews. The other options, such as owning a house or having loyal friends, do not make sense in this context and are unrelated to the experience at the restaurant. Fever and with cat do not fit the situation at all.
The sentence suggests that Greg incurred some sort of penalty or fee related to his inability to pay a cash advance fee. The phrase "dinged for" implies that this penalty was negative or costly. Based on the available choices, the most likely penalty for failure to pay a fee would be a late payment fee, as this is a common penalty for missed or overdue payments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a moral or ethical reason why killing people is wrong, and suggests that the person who is doing the killing may not feel guilty or remorseful about it. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "feelings of guilt." The other options (prison sentence, going to jail, die, hunger) are consequences that may result from the action of killing people, but they do not explain why the person is doing it in the first place.
The sentence uses the word "relaxing" and "not doing anything" together, which suggests a state of relaxation that could lead to sleepiness. The option "shut eyes" is not a plausible answer as it is only a description of a physical action that could happen during relaxation, rather than an outcome. "Listening to music" and "reading" may also be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily lead to falling asleep. Therefore, "falling asleep" is the correct answer.
The question mentions someone spraying another person with a hose. This action commonly results in someone becoming wet, as the water from the hose will soak their clothing and skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the man is using the TV as a distraction or means of avoiding something. The use of the word "instead" suggests that the man is choosing TV over another activity, which is likely spending quality time with his wife. The other options, such as getting fat, entertainment, and wasting time, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not involve the man's relationship with his wife. Arguments could be a possibility, but the use of the word "avoiding" suggests that the man is actively trying to prevent a negative interaction.
The sentence suggests that the woman can hear the small dog, which means that the dog must be in a location where it can make noise, such as barking or whimpering. Out of the provided choices, a tree is the only location where a small dog could potentially climb and make vocalizations while staying hidden from the woman's view. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the smell of the food made Joe feel a physical reaction in his body. The most logical body part likely to experience such a reaction is his stomach, as it is directly related to the ingestion and digestion of food. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that stress can have a negative impact on a person's mood, and can sometimes lead to a more serious mental health issue such as depression. While stress can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches and high blood pressure, the word "mood" implies a more emotional response. Depression is a common condition associated with prolonged stress, and can have a debilitating impact on a person's mental and physical wellbeing. Fatigue can also be a consequence of stress, but it is not specifically linked to mood changes in the sentence. Heart attacks are a more extreme outcome of high blood pressure, which is not always a direct result of stress.
The sentence is discussing human anatomy and specifically refers to the storage of urine. The bladder is the organ responsible for storing urine before it is eliminated from the body. The other options, such as feelings, names, and naval, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are not related to human anatomy. Additionally, "bladders" is repeated twice in the list of choices, so it is the only logical option to choose.
The question is asking for a location where people go to pray, which is commonly associated with religious practices. Going to church is a common practice among many religious faiths, where people gather to worship and pray together. Kneeling is a common physical posture while praying, but it doesn't answer the question about where people go to pray. Ground and ignorance have no clear connection to the context of the question, and while speaking to God can be done anywhere, the question is specifically asking for a location.
The sentence suggests that the person is considering a wig as a solution to some problem with their hair. The phrase "had begun to" implies that there has been a recent change in the person's hair, and the phrase "up top" suggests that the issue is with the hair on their head. The options "composted," "curl," and "worn free" do not make sense in this context. "Thin out" is a possibility, but doesn't necessarily imply the need for a wig. "Fall out" is the most likely option, as it describes a common hair issue that might prompt someone to consider wearing a wig.
The sentence implies that Colorado's decision to legalize marijuana was significant and groundbreaking in some way. Since Colorado is a state within the United States, the correct answer is "United States." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they are either not part of the United States (Mexico) or not relevant to marijuana legalization (Texas and Arizona).
A den is typically a comfortable room in a house that is used for leisure activities such as watching TV, reading, or playing games. Board games are commonly played in dens, as they provide a relaxed and social environment for players. A shelf or cupboard may be used to store board games, but they are not typically played on these surfaces. A shower is not an appropriate place to play board games as it is a wet area designed for personal hygiene. "House" is too general and does not provide any contextual clues relevant to the question.
The sentence implies that the man wanted to go shopping but didn't want to be around many people. A high street is a shopping district in a town or city center, often lined with shops and restaurants, but typically less crowded than a shopping mall or busy city area. Canada is a country and not a specific location that the man could have gone to.
The sentence suggests that the small dog is outside of a warm home with a laughing family inside, which implies that the dog does not have a home or family of its own. Therefore, the correct answer would be "own home." The options "cold room," "suburb," and "nursing home" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Own house" is similar to "own home," but "home" is a more commonly used term for a place where a person or animal lives.
The sentence suggests that the person being discussed enjoys rap music, which may surprise those around them. However, the person justifies their enjoyment of the genre by suggesting that every genre has good music within it. This implies that the person believes that there is no inherently bad genre of music, but rather that it is a matter of personal taste. The answer choice "good music" reflects this reasoning, while the other options are specific genres that do not necessarily relate to the argument being made.
The Library of Congress is one of the largest libraries in the world, with over 170 million items in its collection, including books, maps, manuscripts, photographs, and more. It is known for being the largest library in North America and is a symbol of knowledge and discovery. The other options, such as a desk, closet, or classroom, are not large enough to hold a significant collection of books or have any connection to being a library.
Police officers typically work out of police stations, which serve as headquarters for law enforcement operations in a given area. While police officers may be present in towns or directing traffic, these are not stereotypical settings for police officers. "Wrong place" is vague and does not provide any helpful information, while "donut shop" is a common stereotype but not necessarily reflective of reality.
The question implies that the context is relating to storing or collecting more than one drop of blood. A test tube is commonly used in medical settings to hold and preserve samples of blood or other bodily fluids, while the other options - person, human body, battlefield, and doctor - do not seem to be directly related to the idea of storing or collecting blood in a container.
The phrase "never makes much money or status" suggests that the worker has not succeeded in improving their financial or social standing despite their efforts. The phrase "labor in vain" means to work without achieving any meaningful result or benefit, which would be an accurate description of the situation described in the question. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect the worker's lack of progress or success.
The sentence suggests that Jack only sees communication as a tool to accomplish something. The phrase "beyond the basics" suggests that he only sees the need to communicate when it is necessary to exchange information. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman has a specific goal when it comes to shopping - to save money. The phrase "on sale" is a common indicator of discounted or reduced prices, which implies that the woman is looking for ways to save money on her purchases. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the idea of saving money through shopping.
The word "frustrated" implies a negative emotion, and the choices given are all related to religion or mythology. "Devil" is often associated with negative emotions and actions such as anger and frustration, while the other choices are more positive, neutral, or even holy. The meaning of the question is also important in choosing the correct answer, as it specifically asks for a word that someone might shout in a moment of frustration.
The sentence suggests that the divider referred to is found in a house, where couches and chairs are typically found in a communal area known as the living room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Wood framing is commonly used in construction to create the structure or skeleton of a building. This involves using wooden beams and posts to support the weight of the building and provide a framework for walls, floors, and roofs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the person chose to take a bus for their vacation instead of flying, indicating that cost was a significant factor in their decision-making process. This suggests that the person was likely trying to save money, making "saving money" the correct answer. The other options, such as "sitting down" or "making soup," have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the kid had a specific interest in one particular item among many options, which implies that the item was unique and eye-catching. The choice of the word "parade" suggests that there were many attractive and colorful objects on display. Additionally, toy stores and playgrounds are more common locations for kids to find toys, while a flower shop is unlikely to have a toy balloon available.
The sentence implies that despite not completing high school, the person enjoyed reading. The phrase "better one's mind" suggests that reading was a way for the person to improve themselves mentally. The other options may be related to the idea of reading, but do not specifically address why the person enjoyed it despite not completing high school.
Plumbing refers to the system of pipes and fixtures that bring water into a building and remove waste water. The bathroom is the room in a house where the majority of plumbing fixtures are located, such as sinks, toilets, and showers/bathtubs. While it is possible to have plumbing in a kitchen as well, it is typically a smaller amount and not as complex as the plumbing in a bathroom. Oil refineries and underground locations have no relevance to the context, and while plumbing may be located in walls, this is not the most likely location for it to be found in a house.
The sentence suggests that the wooden rod was part of a chime, which is a component commonly found in antique clocks. The fact that the sentence refers to the object as an "antique" further supports the idea that it is referring to a clock. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the rubber shark is being portrayed as a villain, which is a common trope in bad movies. Movies often create unrealistic or exaggerated characters to dramatize the plot and create suspense, which may explain why a rubber shark was chosen as a villain. The other options, such as a museum or sea world, do not necessarily have any connection to a rubber shark being portrayed as a villain.
The word "tattle" suggests that someone is threatening to reveal or report something. In this context, the person is threatening to do so if they don't get what they want. The word "also" suggests that this person wants something in addition to what they already have or are entitled to. The word "otherwise" indicates a contrast between two possibilities, which fits with the idea of the person wanting something different or else they will tattle. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Horses are commonly found in fields in rural areas or the countryside where there is plenty of open space for grazing and exercise. Keeping horses in barn stalls or on a race track is not ideal as they need space to move around freely. Fairs are also not a typical place to find horses in fields.
Banks are typically considered to be financial centers because they handle financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, loans, and investments. The other options do not accurately describe the purpose or function of a bank. "Main street" and "grocery store" describe the location or physical appearance of a building, while "secure place" and "pool of currency" are general descriptions that could apply to many different types of buildings.
The sentence suggests that feeling a material is a sensory experience that occurs in a physical environment. The options "fabric store" and "attic" may be physical locations, but they do not necessarily imply that the person is in a physical context related to touching materials. "Anything" is too vague and does not provide any context for understanding the sentence. "Science lab" implies an artificial environment rather than a natural, physical one. Therefore, the correct answer is "physical world."
MRE stands for "Meal, Ready-to-Eat" and is a type of food ration used by military personnel in the field. This type of food is not commonly found in fairgrounds, picnics, neighbor's houses, or supermarkets, but is primarily used by the military. Therefore, the correct answer is military base.
The question suggests that the library in question is not open to everyone, but rather only to a certain age group. Based on this, the most likely option would be a college library, which typically only allows students and faculty to access its resources. The other options, such as a house, kindergarden, school or downtown, do not fit the criteria of a library that is restricted to a certain age group.
The sentence describes Jill walking to a cubicle, which is typically found in an office building. The other options, such as a house or hotel, do not typically have cubicles. Additionally, the mention of a floor number suggests a multi-level building, which further supports the answer of an office building. The option of a chair is illogical as it does not indicate a location.
The question asks for a heat source that can be obtained for free, which eliminates options like gasoline and a car. A bedroom is not a heat source, and fire may not always be free depending on the availability of wood or other fuels. Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of heat that can be harvested using solar panels, making it the correct answer.
In order to travel from Atlanta to Hong Kong, the most common mode of transportation would be by plane, and the departure point would be an airport. The other options, such as a car or skateboard, would not be practical for traveling such a long distance across an ocean. A bus stop or subway may be used to get to the airport, but they are not the primary mode of transportation for the long journey to Hong Kong.
The sentence implies that the sedative had a positive effect on the patient's pain, which is likely to have caused them to feel better. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely outcome of the sedative, which is to reduce pain and help the patient feel more comfortable. Additionally, the option "immobilize" does not make sense in the context of a sedative for pain relief.
The context of the sentence implies that the speaker is looking for a specific item, an old pie safe with decorative tin. An antique store is a place where one would typically find such an item. The other options, a shopping bag, trash, landfill, and cupboard, do not make sense in this context.
An icebox built a hundred years ago is considered an antique item, which means it is likely to be sold in an antique store rather than in a regular store or a junkyard. While it is possible that some people may still have an icebox in their homes, it is unlikely that it would be a hundred years old, and it wouldn't be sold in a kitchen or a Walmart.
Istanbul is known for its rich history of crafting and selling fine carpets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location of the fox movie is important to its reputation or recognition. Foxes are often associated with rural areas and grassy fields, so it makes sense that this type of environment would be a likely setting for a movie featuring a fox. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A disco is a type of nightclub that typically features music for dancing and often includes a dance floor, DJ booth, and bar. Therefore, the most likely answer would be "club," as it reflects the type of establishment that would have a disco. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person in question used a beam to create a temporary structure over a flooded gap. The most logical choice for what he created would be a bridge. The other options, such as warehouse or metal shop, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Shop and new construction are too vague to be the correct choice.
The sentence suggests that James was looking for a bar, which is a type of establishment where alcoholic drinks are served. A public house is another term for a bar or pub, whereas an airport and salon do not typically have bars. Michigan is a state, and a nightclub is not a likely place for James to visit when going to see his sister.
Sharks are typically found in the open ocean, particularly in deeper waters away from shore. The deep ocean provides a suitable environment for many species of sharks, such as the great white, tiger, and hammerhead sharks. Sea World and maritime museums may have sharks on display, but they are generally not found in these environments naturally. Pet stores would not typically carry sharks, and the Great Barrier Reef is a coral reef ecosystem, not a location commonly associated with sharks, although some species can be found there.
The opposite of progressive is a term that refers to a more traditional or conventional approach, which is often associated with conservatism. The other options are all related to negative or backwards movement, but do not necessarily indicate an opposition to progress.
Learning is often associated with gaining more knowledge and becoming more intelligent. Teachers are typically the ones imparting knowledge to students, so it is unlikely that "teacher" is the correct answer. "Dysfunction" does not relate to the purpose of learning, and "know more" is just another way of saying "more knowledge," so both of these options may be eliminated with a little bit of reasoning.
The sentence suggests that a person has accidentally caused harm to another person, which would likely result in feelings of guilt and shame. None of the other answer choices would make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the consequences of accidentally causing harm to someone else.
The question refers to a large city on the east coast, which narrows down the options to a handful of choices. The options "jail" and "michigan" are unlikely choices for a question about bars and eateries, and "nightclub" and "restaurant" could refer to many cities. However, "new york city" is known for its vast array of bars and restaurants, making it the most likely answer.
Bees need fresh air to breathe and without it, they may die from suffocation. The only option that contains a structure where air circulation may be limited is the green house. The other options are all outdoor environments where air flow is not typically restricted.
Body building is a sport that requires intense physical training and conditioning. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context of the question is "train". This is because preparing to compete in body building involves practicing and perfecting various exercises and techniques to build muscle mass and achieve a defined physique. The other options do not reflect the necessary physical preparation required for body building, such as being "smart" or simply "signing up".
The sentence suggests that the person in question did not intentionally lie, but still had a powerful quality that could have caused confusion or misunderstanding. The word "imagination" would fit this description, as it suggests that the person may have inadvertently created a false narrative or perception of events due to their creative thinking. The other options all describe deliberate acts of deception or concealment, which do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the answer must be something that can hold food. Out of the options given, only a suitcase is commonly used for carrying food, particularly when traveling. The universe, stomach, and stone are obviously not containers for food, and while a box or jar can be used to store food, they are not as commonly associated with it as a suitcase is.
Going to a play requires a ticket to enter the theater and watch the performance. Without a ticket, one would not be allowed to enter the theater. Patience and time may be required for waiting in line or for the play to start, but they are not necessary to purchase. Having a ticket would make sense grammatically, but it is not a commonly used phrase. A hat also does not have any connection to going to a play.
The term "reception area" typically refers to a space in an office building where visitors can wait to be greeted and receive assistance, including obtaining a key. While a hospital, law firm, gym, and motel may also have reception areas, the context of the sentence suggests that an office building is the most likely location for waiting to obtain a key.
The sentence suggests that it is important to eat breakfast in the morning but not too much, implying that there is a risk of eating too much in the morning. Overeating refers to the harmful habit of consuming excessive amounts of food, which can lead to indigestion and other health problems. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the speaker was engaged in the act of creating art, and therefore the end product would likely be a work of art. The other options are either outcomes that could result from creating art or subjective experiences that the creator might have while making art, but they are not the actual end product of the creative process. The end product of creating art is usually a tangible object, such as a painting, sculpture, or photograph.
The word "tickling" in the sentence suggests a playful or lighthearted interaction. Cats are known for using their whiskers to explore and interact with their environment, which can be playful and ticklish for their human companions. The other options - purring, four paws, four legs, and two eyes - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about something that all people have at first but might not have later in life. The option that fits this criterion is 'parents.' All individuals have parents at birth, but some may lose them due to various reasons such as separation, divorce, or death. The other options such as mentality, feelings, muscles, and brains are not things that people typically lose over time.
The sentence suggests that the solution to loneliness involves spending time with someone else. Out of the options, "meet friend" is the best choice as it specifically mentions seeing someone who you already consider a friend. "Socialize" and "make friends" are possible ways to alleviate loneliness, but in this context, they are not as direct as meeting up with someone you already know. "Make people laugh" and "get fight" are unlikely solutions to loneliness and are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person is going fishing in the river. One of the main goals of fishing is to catch fish, so this is the most likely answer. The other options, such as buying bait or dropping fish, describe actions that could be related to fishing but do not directly answer the question. And wading in the river could be a way to access better fishing spots, but it doesn't directly answer the question of what you do to the river when you go fishing.
The word "surprising" suggests that the bill was unexpected or shocking, which could potentially elicit a strong emotional response such as fear or being scared. The options "annoyance," "happy," "humor," and "irritated" do not fit with the context of a surprising bill.
The sentence suggests that the country being referred to can be described as a "region." A region is a defined area distinguished by geographic, cultural, or political characteristics. The other options, such as continent, America, great outdoors, and forests, are either too broad or too specific to describe "most of the country."
The sentence suggests that in order to get in shape, something is needed in between workouts. This could refer to the fact that the body needs time to rest and recover in order to build muscle and improve fitness. The option "give up" contradicts this idea, while "eat more" may be counterproductive to weight loss goals. "Dance" and "jogging" may be types of workouts, but they do not directly address the need for a period of recovery. Therefore, "period of recovery" is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that people enjoy getting wet during the summer season. One possible reason for this is to cool off, as water has a cooling effect on the body. The option "get cold" may be the opposite of what people want during a hot summer day. "Relax" could be a possible reason for getting wet, but it does not necessarily explain why people specifically like getting wet in the summer. "Catching cold" and "catch cold" are essentially the same option and do not make sense in this context as they imply getting sick rather than cooling off.
The question implies that the person needs to acquire an eyeglasses case, which suggests they do not currently have one. A store is a logical place to look for an eyeglasses case as it is a commonly sold item in stores that sell eyeglasses or accessories. The other options do not seem to be as relevant in this context, as a factory or bag would not necessarily have an eyeglasses case readily available, a purse may or may not be large enough to hold an eyeglasses case, and a shirt pocket may not be a secure or protective enough option for an eyeglasses case.
The sentence mentions farmland, which is typically found in rural areas rather than urban or suburban locations. Additionally, Mt. Rushmore is a natural landmark that is situated in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, which is predominantly rural and known for its scenic beauty. This indicates that the location being referred to is likely in the countryside. The other options, such as house and farming areas, are too specific and do not provide enough context to make an informed choice.
The sentence implies that the spy left something at a designated drop location and the handlers were observed doing something in relation to that item. "Pick up" is the correct answer because it suggests that the handlers were retrieving the item left by the spy. "Hold onto" and "carrying" imply that the handlers were already in possession of the item, which does not match the context of the sentence. "Catch" and "picking up" may be possible choices, but "picking up" is a more specific and accurate representation of the action being described.
The sentence suggests that sweet has a complementary taste that goes well with another taste. One common pairing is sweet and sour, as found in many dishes like sweet and sour chicken or sweet and sour sauce. The other options do not have a strong association with sweetness in terms of taste pairing. For example, bitter and sweet are often opposite tastes, while salty and dry do not create a pleasing contrast with sweetness.
The sentence states that noise takes the form of static in a radio, suggesting that the context is related to radio transmissions. The other options do not have any clear connection to radio transmissions or noise in a radio.
The question is asking for a strategy to avoid overspending when making purchases. Making a list of items you need and their prices can help you stay within a budget and not overspend. Paying, spending money, and getting money are not strategies for avoiding overspending. "Have in mind" is too broad and doesn't provide a clear action to take.
Cats are known for their love of sleep, and they often seek out comfortable positions to rest in. This is a common behavior among cats, as they are known to gravitate towards soft, warm spots in order to rest and relax. The other options, such as the floor, residential area, family room, or upside down, are not necessarily related to the context of the sentence, and do not provide any clear indication of how a cat might lay down to sleep.
The question implies that the cow getting an award is a significant event, which suggests that it is likely taking place at some kind of competition or exhibition. A county fair is a common event where livestock are showcased and judged, so it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as stable, barnyard, sheepfold, and farmyard, are locations where cows may be kept or raised, but they do not have the same association with awards or competitions.
The description of the room suggests that it is a small, self-contained living space with basic amenities, which is commonly found in motels. Schools, hotels, and apartments usually have multiple rooms and may not have a stove or a fridge in the same room as the bed. A friend's house may have a couch and a television, but most likely would not have a stove or a fridge in the same room as the bed.
The word "abandoned" suggests that the garbage cans were left in a hidden or obscure place, rather than in a more obvious location like a driveway, garage, or street. The options "alley" and "own backyard" have a stronger association with places where items might be hidden or left out of sight.
The question asks for a suitable place to store leftover soup, which suggests that the correct answer needs to be a container or receptacle of some sort. A toilet mug or supermarket are clearly inappropriate options, and a jar may not be large enough to hold the soup. A cupboard is a possible option, but it does not provide an airtight seal and may not keep the soup fresh for very long. Therefore, a container is the most logical and practical choice.
Forklifts are commonly used in warehouses to move heavy loads and stack them onto shelves for storage. The other options do not typically involve the need for a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves. A loading dock may involve the use of a forklift to unload or load trucks, but not necessarily to stack boxes. A construction site and yard may use different types of machinery for heavy lifting, but not typically a forklift. A supermarket would not usually require the use of a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves.
The word "cottage" suggests a small, cozy dwelling commonly found in rural areas. The phrase "gets flooded often" implies that the area in question is prone to flooding, which is more likely to happen in rural areas with bodies of water nearby, such as rivers or lakes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the goal of the battle was to defeat the enemy, which is commonly associated with achieving victory. The other options do not fit with the context of a battle and are not logical goals for soldiers to aim for.
The sentence implies that the view was not clear or bright before changing batteries, which suggests that it was dim. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that living life too hard has negative consequences. "Early death" is a logical choice because excessive stress, unhealthy behaviors, and reckless decision-making can all contribute to premature mortality. "Over age," "valuable," "joy," and "happiness" do not fit the context and imply a positive outcome, which is not supported by the sentence.
The word "ping" in the question refers to a message sent from one computer to another to check if the second computer is online and available. A "spam blog" is a blog that has been created solely for the purpose of sending spam messages. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a word that combines "ping" and "spam blog." Of the options given, only "sping" (a combination of "spam" and "ping") fits this description. The other options are not related to spam blogs or online messaging.
The sentence suggests that there is a difference between simply existing and truly living life, and that having a sense of purpose is important for the latter. Purpose gives direction and meaning to one's actions and choices, and can create a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Acquiring knowledge and happiness may contribute to one's sense of purpose, but they are not necessarily the key to living life. The options "existing" and "joy" do not address the idea of truly living life versus simply existing.
The sentence suggests that the parking lots are associated with stores, which implies a commercial setting. The other options (urban area, business district, airport, amusement park) may have parking lots, but they do not necessarily have stores associated with them.
The sentence suggests that the student is experiencing a decrease in their sense of self-worth or value due to their failure. The word "no longer" implies that the student previously felt a sense of worth or value, which is associated with the choice "worthy." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Rivers with flowing water are a common feature on planet Earth. While there may be other celestial bodies that feature rivers or similar water formations, the context of the question strongly implies that the answer is related to a planet that humans are familiar with, and Earth is the only option that fits that criteria. The other options are either not planets, or there is no clear connection to flowing water.
Ficus trees are commonly used as indoor plants in office buildings due to their ability to thrive in low light conditions and their air-purifying qualities. They are often placed in hallways and common areas, as well as in individual offices, including the boss's office. They can be planted in large pots and placed in various locations throughout the building. Tropical zones and regions are not specific to where a ficus tree would be found in an office building.
The context of the question is related to buying materials for a specific item, which is a pillow. A fabric store typically sells various types of fabrics, including those suitable for pillow-making, such as cotton, linen, and silk. The other options, such as construction, toy store, and factory, are not commonly associated with selling fabrics for crafts or home decor. House is also not a viable option as it is an improper noun and does not refer to a specific store or shop.
The sentence contrasts Jason's calm exterior with the fact that he has recently experienced losses, implying that he is now experiencing some negative emotions. "Anxious" is the most likely option because it suggests a sense of worry or unease, which would be a natural response to experiencing losses. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "frustrated" and "flustered" suggest a sense of agitation rather than calmness, "excited" suggests a positive emotion rather than a negative one, and "calmness" is the opposite of what is being described in the sentence.
Balconies are a common feature of residential buildings such as apartments and condos, as they provide outdoor space and an additional living area. The other options listed do not have a clear connection to the presence of balcony railings, and may instead have other distinguishing features, such as ornate decorations in theaters or high-end amenities in hotels.
The sentence suggests that something is being wrecked during car chases in movies, and that thing is specifically referred to as a "stand". The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. It is important to pay attention to specific keywords and context clues in order to choose the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that going the wrong way leads to some negative consequences. Out of the given choices, "make mistakes" is the most fitting in this context. Going the wrong way is usually associated with choosing the incorrect path, making errors or taking decisions that may not be beneficial, which all involve making mistakes. The other options such as schizophrenia or ridiculous do not seem relevant to the given context.
A door jamb is the vertical part of a door frame into which a hinged door fits. If the jamb is moved, it can affect the movement of the door. The other options are not directly related to the function of a door or its frame.
The sentence suggests that the speaker had a preconceived notion about the personality of elephants, but was surprised to find that the younger ones were playful. The word "playful" means that the elephants were lively, active, and enjoyed having fun. This characteristic is often associated with young animals, including elephants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that the runway being referred to involves shoes that would be considered unusual or unorthodox, even for drag queens. Given the options provided, a golf course would be the most likely place for such shoes to be worn, as golf shoes tend to be designed for function rather than fashion, and would likely look out of place in other contexts such as a military base or a fashion show. The other options have no apparent connection to the idea of shoes that are unconventional.
Bees are attracted to flowers for their nectar and pollen, which they use as food. Herb gardens often contain a variety of flowering plants, such as lavender and thyme, which are particularly attractive to bees. The other choices, including the sky, story book, great outdoors, and picnic, do not have a direct connection to the food sources of bees.
Obstructing justice is a criminal offense that involves knowingly interfering with the legal process, such as tampering with evidence, lying to investigators, or intimidating witnesses. As such, the consequences typically involve criminal charges and the possibility of imprisonment. The other options are not accurate descriptions of the potential outcomes.
The items listed (copy paper, pens, and desks) are commonly associated with office supplies, suggesting that an office supply store would be the most likely location to purchase them. The other options, such as a supermarket or artist's studio, do not specialize in office supplies and therefore would not be the most obvious choice.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to education, and specifically to young people learning. A classroom is a common location for such an activity, especially if the subject matter is related to computers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person wants to satisfy their curiosity, which can only be achieved by finding answers or the truth to their questions. The other options, such as seeing a particular program, going to the market, attending school or eating pizza, do not necessarily address the person's curiosity directly. They may provide temporary pleasure or entertainment, but they do not offer a satisfactory solution to one's curiosity.
Dust is commonly found on the ground and can be easily stirred up and made visible in sunlight. It is less likely to be visible in a restaurant or library, as these spaces are usually well-maintained and cleaned regularly. A windowsill may collect dust but it is usually in small amounts and may not be very visible in sunlight. Carpet can also collect dust, but it may not be visible in sunlight if it is a darker color or if the carpet fibers are dense.
The sentence suggests that James physically moved or adjusted the stairs in some way to make them higher. To accommodate John's request to get up as well, James would have had to lower the stairs. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The use of the name "San Jose" suggests a location within Costa Rica, which is a well-known place for diversity in wildlife, including lizards. Captivity and encyclopedia are unlikely locations for a lizard, while New Mexico and imagination land do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Opera glasses are typically associated with traditional or classical music events, such as operas, and are often used by individuals who want to get a closer view of the performers on stage. Given that the question is asking for old opera glasses, it's reasonable to assume that they may be looking for a vintage or antique pair. Antique stores often sell old and unique items, including rare or vintage opera glasses. The other options do not seem likely to offer old opera glasses.
The question is asking for a better alternative to a paper clip for holding together paperwork in a hospital desk drawer, implying that the paper clip may not be the most reliable or efficient option. The other choices do not necessarily serve this purpose better than a paper clip. A file folder is useful for organizing papers, but it does not hold them together in a confined space. A staple can easily damage important documents and is not conducive to organizing or adjusting the papers. A desk drawer is not a solution for holding papers together. The keyword "hospital" may indicate a need to avoid metal objects for safety reasons, making a plastic holder the most suitable option.
The phrase "under the weather" is commonly used as a euphemism for feeling sick or unwell. Therefore, the correct answer would be the choice that is associated with feeling sick, which is "ill." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the reason fish cannot walk on land is because they do not have a specific body part. Legs are necessary for walking on most surfaces, and fish lack this appendage. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for why fish cannot walk.
The sentence suggests that the reason why John can't eat lunch is that he does not have any food available to him at the moment. The other options - getting, preparing, buying, or needing food - may all be potential reasons why John can't eat lunch, but the sentence specifically states that he doesn't have any food currently.
The sentence suggests that dogs need something in order to behave appropriately. The word "trained" is commonly associated with teaching dogs acceptable behaviors and commands. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the bird was flying before it got tired and needed to land. Out of all the options, roof is the most likely place for a bird to land after flying, as it is a high point and provides a good vantage point for the bird to rest and observe its surroundings. The other options, such as cage, sky, or on the head of a man, are less likely to be the answer because they don't fit the logical progression of the sentence.
The term "superhighway" typically refers to a major highway or freeway that connects different areas within a city. Therefore, the most logical answer would be "city". The other options, such as rural areas, cyberspace, computer networks, and industrialized countries, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
A pack horse is a horse that is trained to carry loads on its back, typically used in outdoor environments such as mountains, forests, and ranches. Among the given choices, only "dude ranch" is associated with outdoor activities involving horses. Belmont Park and race track are associated with horse racing, while women's literature and a movie have no clear association with pack horses.
The sentence mentions that the captain is going to an arena, which suggests that they are part of a team that plays in a sports competition. The options battleship, airplane cabin, and military do not involve sports, so they can be eliminated. The option soldier could be a possibility, but the context of the sentence does not mention anything about war, combat or the military, which rules out that option as well. Therefore, the correct answer is basketball team.
Wheat is a type of crop that is typically grown in open fields, particularly in rural areas where agriculture is common. The other choices, such as bread or mill, are more related to the processing and consumption of wheat rather than its cultivation. Forests are not typical places for growing crops and are better known for their trees and wildlife, so the correct answer is farmer's field.
Cities are well-known for having multiple office buildings, as they are usually the center of business and commerce. Industrial complexes may also have office buildings, but the context of the sentence is not related to industry specifically. Work refers to any location where someone may be employed, so it could be any of the options given. New York is a specific city but not all cities are like New York. Suburbia is the opposite of a city and typically has fewer large office buildings.
The other options do not seem to be an immediate cause to stop driving. Traffic jams may cause delays, but not necessarily a complete stop. Wheels turning and tire wear are normal parts of driving and are not an emergency situation. Lack of fuel is also not an immediate cause to stop driving, as the driver may be able to make it to a gas station. Illness, however, can cause someone to immediately stop driving if they suddenly become incapacitated or unable to operate the vehicle safely.
The question refers to a body part, specifically the ear, which is located on the side of the head. The other options do not have any relevance to the question and can be eliminated as incorrect answers.
The sentence suggests that the person's job is to serve customers, which implies that their primary responsibility is to assist customers with whatever they need. The word "help" directly corresponds to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options (such as "come back" or "pay to") do not make any sense in the context of serving customers. "Smile" may be a part of providing good customer service, but it is not the main responsibility of the person mentioned in the sentence. "Money" implies a transactional relationship, which again doesn't fit with the idea of serving customers.
The sentence suggests that the opposite of being "thick" is being something else. From the choices, only "slender" is a common antonym for "thick," meaning thin or slim. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Attending a lecture is a common way for students to acquire knowledge on a specific subject. The fact that the student is attending a lecture on engineering suggests that they are interested in learning about this field of study and hope to gain knowledge from the lecture. The other options, such as becoming smarter or going to sleep, do not fit the context of attending a lecture on a specific subject.
Fire extinguishers are typically placed in areas where fires are more likely to occur, such as kitchens, workshops, or mechanical rooms. In a building with no windows, it is important to have a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergencies. A stairwell is a common location for fire extinguishers because it is a central location and easy to access from different parts of the building. The other options do not make much sense in the context of the question.
The question implies that the sofabed is not a permanent fixture in the room and is only used for guests, suggesting that it is located in a room specifically designated for visitors. The options sitting room, living room, and dining room are typically used by the residents of the house, making them less suitable for a guest sleeping arrangement, while a basement is not necessarily a common area for guests. A spare room is often set up specifically for guests and may include a variety of sleeping arrangements, including a sofabed.
The sentence suggests that the old lady preferred to search for the restaurant's information using a particular method, which the granddaughter was trying to challenge with her smartphone. The phrase "yellow pages" refers to a directory that lists businesses and their contact information, which was commonly used before the widespread adoption of digital technologies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a word that describes something that is not optional and must be done. "Mandatory" is the best choice as it means something that is required by law or rule and cannot be avoided. "Obligatory," "required," and "compulsory" all have similar meanings to "mandatory" and have a similar connotation of something that is necessary. "Selective," on the other hand, means being very careful in your choice and does not fit the context of the question.
The question is asking what you need to do if you don't work from home, implying that you need to go somewhere to start work. The other options do not relate to the context of the question. Walking in the rain, sleeping at night, resting, and riding a bus are not actions that specifically relate to starting work or leaving your home.
The word "rapid" suggests that the question is asking about a place where construction is happening quickly or on a large scale. Urban areas are typically known for having high population densities and high demand for new buildings, which can drive rapid construction. The other options do not have any clear association with rapid building.
The sentence implies that Dan is doing something to make the car do something, and the word "accelerator" suggests that he is trying to speed up. Therefore, the correct answer is "moving." The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence, or they are the opposite of what is being described (e.g. "slow down").
The sentence suggests that the location of the churchyard is significant because it is the furthest east in all the contiguous states. Of the given options, Maine is the state furthest east and is therefore the most likely answer. The other options, such as "near the ocean" or "countryside", could apply to many different states and do not provide a clear indication of the specific location of the churchyard.
The context of the question suggests that it is asking for a legitimate and ethical way to improve one's chances of winning in a competition. Cheating and sabotage are unethical and would not result in a genuine victory. Fairness is a basic expectation but does not provide any useful tips for winning. "In competition" is not a specific action that one can take to improve their chances of winning. Practicing, on the other hand, is a well-known way to improve one's skills and increase their chances of success in a competition.
The sentence suggests that the treats the dog enjoyed were beneficial to some aspect of his health. The context implies that the treats were not simply for pleasure, but for a specific purpose. The options "two eyes," "four legs," and "two ears" are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense in relation to the sentence. The option "one mouth" is not specific enough and does not provide any clear indication of why the treats were beneficial. The best answer is "teeth," as treats can be used to clean a dog's teeth and promote good oral health.
The word "foreign" suggests that the characters being used are not typically used in the language or alphabet of the reader. Therefore, it may be difficult or impossible for the reader to interpret the meaning of the typing, making the paper's content indeterminate or uncertain. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the ladies at the salon are interested in finding out about something, and that they are eager to hear news whenever someone new arrives. This suggests that they are looking for updates on current events, gossip, or other developments that may be of interest to them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or suggest a desire to learn about something new.
The word "intricate" suggests that the machine had many complex and detailed components. The term "apparatus" is often used to describe a complex set of mechanical or electronic equipment, which fits with the idea of an intricate machine. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the thing being described is not likely to be considered bad by anyone. The options "profitable," "beneficial," and "valued" all have positive connotations and therefore don't fit the description. "Excellent" could also be seen as positive, but could potentially also have negative connotations depending on the context. "Competent," however, is a neutral or even slightly positive term that is unlikely to be considered bad by anyone.
The sentence suggests that the person being referred to lives in New York City and has a bathroom that they use frequently. Based on common living situations in New York City, it is likely that the person lives in an apartment, which is the most common type of housing in the city. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the idea of a personal bathroom for someone living in New York City.
The sentence suggests that the lady was trying to reduce her intake of sweets and snacks, which typically contain high amounts of sugar and calories. As a result, it can be inferred that her weight would likely decrease if she continued to eat less of these types of foods. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - defecating is a bodily function, becoming full is a temporary sensation, and gaining weight goes against the goal of the lady trying to eat less sweets and snacks.
The context suggests that the committee meets regularly after something specific. Given the options, church seems like the most likely answer as many committees and organizations meet after church services on a Sunday. The other options are not typically associated with meetings for committees or organizations.
Linoleum is a type of flooring material that is often used in high-traffic areas such as kitchens and living rooms. However, the question specifically asks what you would put on the surface covered with linoleum, which suggests that the answer should be something placed on top of the linoleum. Furniture is a common item that is placed on flooring surfaces, regardless of the material. The other options are not necessarily associated with being placed on top of a flooring surface.
The sentence mentions cows enjoying sunshine and solitude by a barn, which suggests that they are on a farm. The option "countryside" also suggests this, as farms are often located in rural areas. The other options, such as "fairgrounds" and "on the moon," have no connection to the context of the sentence and can be disregarded. "Give birth to dogs" is also an absurd option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the barbershop is located within a larger structure that houses multiple stores. Shopping malls often have multiple stores under one roof, making them a likely place to find a barbershop that is not in a separate building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker has been traveling and needs to unload their luggage, which is something typically done at a hotel. Hotels are places where travelers can stay and store their luggage while they explore the area. Train stations, ship decks, and bus depots may have luggage storage facilities, but they are not typically the first places people think of when looking to unload their luggage. A bus stop usually doesn't have any storage facilities at all.
MIT is a university that is widely known for its focus on science, engineering, and technology. As such, it is likely that a student who is interested in computers may attend MIT in order to pursue their studies in this field. The other options do not have any clear connection to computer science or technology.
The sentence suggests that Joe chose to rent a type of living space called a loft. A loft is typically a large, open space in a city building that was originally used for a commercial or industrial purpose and has been converted into living quarters. Soho is a neighborhood in New York City known for its artsy loft apartments, but it is not a type of living space. A hunting lodge is a rustic, rural accommodation for hunters, and a frame house is a type of traditional suburban or rural dwelling. Room and board usually refers to a type of short-term accommodation, such as a hotel or guesthouse.
The sentence suggests that turning up the thermostat has made the person feel warmer, which is a common goal when adjusting the temperature. Feeling comfortable is the most likely outcome of making this change. Overheating and starting a fire are unlikely consequences of simply increasing the thermostat in a bedroom, while an increase in temperature and pleasure are not necessarily related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people typically engage in a morning activity with their family, and the choices reflect different possible options. However, the word "stereotypically" suggests that there may be some cultural or social expectations surrounding this activity. Eating breakfast is a common family activity in many cultures, and it is often seen as a time for sharing and bonding. The other options may not be as popular or widely practiced in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the little cameras in the car made something easier, and the context of the sentence implies that it has to do with driving or parking. "Back up" is the only option that directly relates to driving and parking, as having cameras in the back of a car can make it easier to see and navigate when reversing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when you go to buy a sheep, you will learn something specific about it. The clue is in the word "sheep" itself, which usually refers to an adult female or male sheep. However, the choices suggest that the sentence may be referring to something else. The word "lamb" is the most likely answer, as it refers to a young sheep, and is often purchased for its meat. The other options, such as "wool" and "goat", do not necessarily apply to the context of buying a sheep.
Shopping malls are typically located in busy, urban areas where there is a high concentration of people and a large amount of foot traffic. Downtown areas are known for having many shopping options and commercial developments, so it is likely that a popular shopping mall would be located there. The other options do not have the same level of commercial development or population density as downtown areas, making them less likely locations for a popular shopping mall.
The sentence suggests that the wound is not urgent, so it is not necessary to go to an emergency room or hospital. A library is not a typical place to go for medical attention, but it may be where someone goes to research or learn more about how to treat their non-urgent wound. The other options are related to getting medical attention, which is not necessary in this case.
The sentence suggests that soldiers undergo a significant amount of training, which presumably prepares them for a specific task. The phrase "fight for freedom" seems like a plausible choice, but the sentence does not indicate that this is the purpose of the training. Instead, it suggests that the training is intended to prepare soldiers to engage in combat with an opponent, which makes "fight enemy" the correct choice. The other options, such as following orders or instructions, may be part of a soldier's training, but they do not capture the main purpose of the training that is mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John enjoys playing a specific instrument (a brass drum) and has an interest in classical music. Orchestras typically play classical music compositions and often include brass drum instruments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well - "low notes" could refer to any instrument, "rock band" is unrelated to classical music, "sing" does not involve playing an instrument, and "drum set" is not specific enough to match the description of a brass drum.
The word "corrupt" implies unethical and dishonest behavior, which can lead to negative consequences such as instability, unrest, and social unrest. In the context of a government, corruption often involves bribery, nepotism and misallocation of resources, which can lead to economic decline and exacerbate inequalities, among other things. The term "civilization" implies a more positive outcome, and the other options do not fit with the negative connotations of corruption.
The use of tools is often considered an indicator of intelligence in animals, as it requires problem-solving abilities and the ability to understand cause and effect. The other options may be characteristics of birds, but they do not specifically relate to the use of tools.
The sentence indicates that John cleaned the place where food is served last, which implies that he likely cleaned the table. Shelves and libraries are not typically places where food is served, and the fridge and refrigerator are not mentioned as being dirty or in need of cleaning.
The sentence suggests that James was responsible for maintaining the rose bushes in his yard, which requires knowledge and skill in gardening. The word "talented" also implies that James was skilled in this area. The other options do not fit as well with the sentence; while "backyard" and "beautiful garden" relate to the setting, they do not describe James's skills, and "plants" and "kew gardens" are too general and specific, respectively.
The question suggests that killing people may have an effect on one of the victims. It is known that guilt is a common emotion experienced by individuals after committing a violent act or crime against others. The other options do not have a direct connection with the concept of killing people making one of the victims do something.
The sentence is referring to a season, winter, which is commonly associated with lower temperatures and colder weather. People typically feel cold during the winter because of the changes in temperature, and this is reflected in the sentence. The other options, such as using money or becoming old, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a nonverbal way to show agreement with someone without getting close or speaking, so options like standing with them or shaking hands wouldn't be appropriate. Nodding alone or shaking hands alone aren't enough without a verbal affirmation, and shaking hands may not be appropriate in all situations. Nodding and smiling together is a common nonverbal cue that indicates agreement, and is often used in situations where the other person is speaking, such as during a meeting or conversation.
The question is asking about a common practice of where to put a book after purchasing it, which is usually in your own personal space for reading and storage like a house or apartment. The other options such as discount store, ground, university, and antique store are not places where books are typically stored after purchase.
Farmer's markets are well-known for selling fresh produce directly from the grower. This means that lettuce can be purchased directly from the person who grew it, allowing for a fresher and more direct connection between the consumer and the producer. Supermarkets and grocery stores typically sell produce that has been transported from larger farms to a central distribution center, and then to the store. Salad refers to a dish made from lettuce and other ingredients, and a refrigerator is an appliance used to store food, not a place to buy it.
The question asks what giving assistance can avoid, implying that it can prevent something negative from happening. The option "trouble" makes sense in this context, as offering help can prevent someone from experiencing difficulties or problems. The other options, such as "feeling good" or "helpfulness," do not have a clear connection to avoiding negative outcomes.
If a vessel is taking in water, it suggests that it is experiencing some kind of problem or emergency situation. In this context, it is likely that the vessel needs to go to a location where it can be repaired or fixed. Both harbor and port are locations where vessels can go to receive repairs or assistance, making them the most likely options. Deeper and ocean do not offer any solutions to the problem of a vessel taking in water, while human body is completely unrelated to the context.
The sentence implies that marmots are captured from their natural habitat. The most logical option among the choices would be wilderness, which could refer to any area where marmots are found in their natural habitat. The other options, such as Switzerland, Spain, Vancouver Island, and Australia, do not have any clear connection to marmot habitats.
The sentence suggests that Jane is waiting for a ride, which is likely to be transportation-related. The option "airport" stands out because it is a common place for people to wait for rides and is often associated with the stress of making a flight. The option "bathroom" seems like the most logical choice given the context, but the sentence specifically states that Jane is not in the bathroom.
A jail is a place where people are typically sent as a form of punishment and confinement, so it's reasonable to assume that a human would not want to be there. The other options (church, school, house, park) do not inherently carry negative connotations, and humans may even enjoy spending time in those places.
The word "games" usually implies some level of competition or goal-oriented activity. To "play" a game usually means to engage in an activity with the intention of achieving a specific outcome or objective, such as winning. While some games can also be educational or focused on creativity (e.g. "learning" or "dancing" games), the majority of games involve trying to beat one's opponents or achieve a high score. Therefore, "try to win" is the most appropriate answer to this question.
The term "nerd" often implies a strong interest in academic pursuits, and a desire for knowledge and understanding. Therefore, of the given choices, "find truth" would be the most likely activity that a nerd would have a curiosity for, as it aligns with their intellectual and analytical interests. The other options are less closely associated with intellectual pursuits and do not necessarily require a curiosity to do.
The sentence suggests that even though the living room was arranged for the party, people tended to gather elsewhere while the mother worked. The kitchen is a common area for gathering during parties, as people often enjoy congregating around food and drinks. The other options, wireroom, ocean, hallway, and outside, do not have any clear connection to party dynamics or household living arrangements.
The sentence suggests that Billy and Marge were a couple who enjoyed spending time together, but were not interested in a serious relationship or being intimate. The option "dance" is the most appropriate answer as it is an activity that two people can enjoy together in a non-romantic way. The other options imply a more serious or intimate relationship between the two, which is not suggested in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the player recognized that they were going to lose the game and therefore chose to give up or surrender rather than continuing to play. The phrase "game over" also implies that the game had ended, further supporting the idea that surrender was the appropriate choice. The other options, such as working harder or defending, do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest the player was still trying to win.
The sentence suggests that the vessel mentioned is associated with criminals and cannons. Pirate ships are typically associated with both of these things, as pirates were known for raiding and pillaging other vessels, and cannons were a key tool in their arsenal. The other options do not have any clear connection to both criminals and cannons in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John plays chess with his roommate between classes, which implies that they are likely in college or university. The most logical place to have a chess set in a college or university setting would be the dorm room, as this is where John and his roommate likely spend most of their time and where they would have easy access to their own chess set. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the people being referred to have a responsibility related to creating or bringing up other people. "Raise children" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to the creation of new people and involves a significant responsibility. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fat man had only run a short distance and was already experiencing some form of difficulty. The option "breathing hard" is the most likely answer as it is common for individuals who are not used to running to experience shortness of breath when they begin to exercise. The other options are not likely as they do not relate to the physical exertion that the man was experiencing.
The context of the sentence indicates that staying in bed on a cold morning brings warmth, which suggests a feeling of comfort. Resting and comfort are related, but the use of the word "warm" indicates that "comfort" may be a more appropriate choice. "Stubborn" and "bed sores" are not related to the context, and "missing out" is not relevant to the sentence's meaning.
The sentence suggests that the term being sought describes a situation where people do not trust their leaders. "Question authority" is a phrase commonly used to encourage individuals to challenge the actions and decisions of those in positions of power. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone is hurting another person, which is a crime. The police are responsible for enforcing laws and arresting individuals who break them. Punishment is a common consequence for committing a crime, so it is the most likely choice. Anger, sadness, and suffering may be emotions felt by the victim or witnesses, but they do not necessarily represent what the police will do.
Crabs are commonly found in coastal regions and in water bodies like oceans, seas, and rivers. The options "fish market," "underpants," and "fishing boat" do not seem like suitable habitats for a crab to live in. Maine is a coastal US state, and while it is possible for crabs to live there, it is not specific enough for the question. Seychelles, however, is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean known for their beaches and marine life, including various species of crabs.
While getting drunk and experiencing a hangover are common side effects of drinking alcohol, death is a severe and uncommon side effect. Alcohol poisoning, accidents while under the influence, and long-term damage to organs can all be potential causes of death related to alcohol consumption. Frequent urination is a common side effect as alcohol acts as a diuretic, but it is not considered a severe side effect.
The question is asking about the path the astronauts would have to take to get to the moon, suggesting that they would need to go through certain elements in order to reach their destination. The correct answer is atmosphere because before reaching outer space, the astronauts would first have to travel through the Earth's atmosphere. Night sky, universe, and air are not elements that the astronauts would have to pass through to reach the moon, while outer space is the destination rather than an element that needs to be traveled through.
The sentence suggests that the leading team had become complacent and stopped actively trying to maintain their advantage because they had grown too comfortable. The phrase "being ahead" directly relates to the idea of the team being in the lead, and it makes sense that they would become complacent when they feel secure in their position. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the event was a musical performance or concert, which typically takes place in an auditorium or theatre. The other options, such as building or airplane, do not typically host musical events or concerts. Show is too general to be a specific location for a concert in this context, so auditorium is the most fitting choice.
The sentence suggests that the person was waiting in line at the airport and finally got to the ticket checker. The person then got out their billfold, which typically includes identification and other important documents. The context of the sentence suggests that the person is showing their ticket and identification to the ticket checker. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man was wearing new clothes and looked good, indicating that his wife might have praised him or given him a positive compliment. The word "complimentary" means expressing admiration or approval, which fits well in the given context. The other options do not make sense in the context or contradict it.
The question is asking about a place where people of the same faith gather, which suggests a religious context. Synagogues are places of worship for Jewish people, while churches are places of worship for Christians. Conferences and car shows do not have a religious connection, and Montana is a state and not a specific place of religious gathering.
The sentence suggests that people who aspire to play guitar often use a specific item made of plastic. The term "chew on" suggests that this item is small and often held in the mouth, and "pick" is a commonly-used item for people who play guitar to pluck the strings of the instrument. The other options do not have any clear connection to playing the guitar.
The word "not optional" implies that there is a requirement or obligation to do something. The words "mandatory," "obligatory," and "compulsory" all indicate that something is required or mandated. "Nonelective" could also be a correct answer as it means something that cannot be chosen or opted out of, but it is less commonly used in everyday language. "Lazy" is not related to the question and is a distractor answer.
The sentence suggests that the living person is close to death, which means that they will soon "expire" or pass away. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone who is dying. "Massage" and "perspiration" suggest physical activity, which is unlikely for someone who is at the end of their life. "Interaction" does not make sense in this context and "respiration" suggests breathing, which may not be relevant for someone who is dying.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to go to sleep sooner than normal, which implies they want to wake up earlier than usual. The phrase "get up early" is the only option that directly relates to the goal of waking up earlier. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that there is some sort of payment or deduction that needs to be made when someone is receiving payment. In most countries, people are required by law to pay a portion of their income as taxes to the government. This is known as income tax. The other options are not directly related to the context of the question, and don't make sense as a response.
The sentence suggests that Jenny was at a location where it was not appropriate for her to answer the phone. Since she was just visiting, it is likely that she was at a friend's house or someone else's residence where she was not expected to answer the phone. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not suggest a location where answering the phone might not be appropriate for someone who is just visiting.
The sentence suggests that the cat had a second chance at life after being nursed back to health by the nice lady. Therefore, it is likely that the cat will have the opportunity to live for many years. The other options do not correlate with the context of the sentence - "dog" is a different kind of animal, "see king" and "sun itself" do not make sense as actions for a cat, and "meow" is what cats usually do.
Narcissists are known for their excessive self-love and self-absorption. One of the common behaviors associated with narcissism is that they tend to dominate conversations and make them all about themselves. They often have a compulsive need to talk about their accomplishments, experiences, and achievements, and tend to ignore or belittle others' contributions. The other options do not align with the commonly observed traits of narcissistic individuals.
The sentence suggests that a bad person does not place value on honesty and acting without pretense. The word "sincere" means genuine or truthful, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options may have some connection to morality or character traits, but they do not directly address the concept of honesty or pretense.
The question implies that there is a place where you can access maps that are not available for purchase. The most likely location for such maps would be a library, which commonly stocks maps and other resources that are not widely available to the public. The other options, such as a cabinet or guide drivers, do not provide access to maps that cannot be bought, while maps that can't be bought are unlikely to be found in bookstores or on the internet.
Marmots are known to be mountain-dwelling animals, living in high-altitude areas such as the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, and the Himalayas. The other options like yellow pages, jungle, woods, and hiding place do not connote any specific habitat that marmots are known to live in.
The sentence suggests that Emma's condition was not improving despite James' attempts to cheer her up with the cats. The phrase "come to something" implies that a turning point had been reached, and Emma may have sensed that her illness had become more serious. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Taxes are a form of revenue for governments, allowing them to fund public services and infrastructure. Therefore, one of the primary reasons for imposing taxes is to acquire money to support the functioning of the government and its various departments. The other options do not align with the general purpose of taxes and have a negative connotation that is not associated with taxes.
The sentence states that Ficus belongs to the family Moraceae which is a part of a much broader spectrum. Moraceae is a family of flowering plants and Ficus belongs to this family. Therefore, the broader spectrum in this context is the plant kingdom, which includes all types of plants ranging from algae to mosses to flowering plants. The other options such as science class, garden, flowerpot, and arboretum are not related to the context of the sentence.
High fiber foods are known to cause an increase in gas production in the digestive system, which can result in flatulence or passing gas. This is a common side effect of eating high fiber foods and is often considered an unpleasant sound or experience. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is interested in seeing a big cat, which is a type of wild animal generally not commonly found in residential areas or barns. The most likely place to find a big cat would be a zoo, which exhibits wild animals for people to observe. The other options do not have any clear connection to the topic of finding a big cat to see.
A mountain range is a geological feature made up of a series of mountains, which are typically made mostly of rock. The other options do not fit the definition of a geological feature made mostly of rock. The countryside refers to a rural area with varying terrain, ground is a general term for the surface of the earth, a street is a man-made thoroughfare, and a bridge is a structure that spans a gap.
The word "relax" suggests that the gentleman is looking for a comfortable and peaceful place to unwind. While a club or meeting may be social, they are not typically associated with relaxation. A meditation center or church may offer a peaceful environment, but they may not be accessible or desirable for everyone. In contrast, being in bed is a common and comfortable place for relaxation and is therefore the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to hitchhike to their destination since their car won't start, and the most common gesture used while hitchhiking is waving one's thumb in the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question specifically asks for a type of computer that is not a laptop, meaning it must have the capabilities of a computer but not be portable. The only option listed that fits this description is a desktop, which is a computer that is designed to be used on a desk rather than being carried around. The other options, such as a library or a table, are not computers at all, and the mention of a space shuttle or microwave oven is meant to be misleading and irrelevant to the question.
The word "thick" suggests a dense and abundant growth of trees. While trees can be found in all of the locations listed in the choices, a forest is typically known for having a high density of trees. Orchards are typically more structured and less dense, while state parks and countryside areas may have a mix of trees and open spaces. Jungles are also known for having dense vegetation, but they are typically found in tropical regions and may not be the most likely answer based on the options provided.
A ladder is a typically used for home maintenance or construction projects, and thus, it is commonly stored in a place where such work is done. A garage is a perfect option as it provides a secure and covered space for storing tools and equipment. The other options, such as an apple orchard or a hardware store, do not make sense as places to store a ladder.
The sentence suggests that the clothes were still in good condition, so it wouldn't make sense to burn or throw them away. "Get rid" and "throw out" are also possibilities, but "give away" is a more positive option and often associated with charity or community giving. Therefore, it is the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that eating breakfast can help improve someone's day if they have been feeling stuck in a routine and busy. Eating breakfast provides energy to start the day and can help boost mood and productivity. The other options, such as dirty dishes, bad breath, and gas, do not relate to the idea of improving one's day.
Dogs are typically taken outside using a leash, which allows the owner to control and guide the dog while out of the house. The other options (front door, porch, table, toilet) do not facilitate taking the dog outside for a walk or to do its business, and may even be unsafe or inappropriate for the dog's needs.
The question is asking about a location in which to place a rug for functional purposes, specifically to keep feet warm at night. The most appropriate answer is "bedroom," as it is the room in which one typically sleeps and where keeping feet warm would be most beneficial. The other choices, such as "table" and "ceiling," do not make sense in the context of the question. "Persia" may be a reference to where the rug was made, but it does not provide any information about where to place it for warmth.
A newspaper is known for providing readers with information about current events, news, and other relevant topics. It is a source of information that is intended to educate and inform readers about what is happening in the world around them. While newspapers may also communicate and announce various announcements or events, their primary purpose is to provide information and news to their readers. "Motivate" and "elongate" do not relate to the primary purpose of a newspaper.
ping score is a common method of determining who wins when playing games. It involves tracking each player's points, goals, or achievements throughout the game and then comparing them at the end to see who has the highest score. Learning how to play the game and trying to win are important steps in playing games, but they do not necessarily determine who wins. Fun is subjective and varies from person to person, and requiring time to be kept may be a rule of some games, but it does not necessarily determine the outcome of the game.
The sentence indicates that the car is traveling from a southern state (Florida) to a northern state (Ohio), which means it is traveling towards the north. The correct answer is "heading north." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence as there is no indication of a rollover, flying, or speeding up.
The Great Barrier Reef is a famous location in Australia known for its diverse marine life, including sharks. The deep ocean and Pacific Ocean are too vast and general to determine a specific location for seeing a shark. The maritime museum and aquarium may have exhibits on sharks, but they are not natural locations to observe living sharks.
The sentence implies that easy-to-get sex can impair one's judgment, suggesting that the easiest sex to get "clouds" one's ability to make good decisions. This is a common expression used to describe how certain actions or substances can impair one's clarity of thought. The other options do not relate to this context and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The fact that the tree had thousands of animals living in it suggests that it was located in a habitat with a rich and diverse animal population. The rainforest is a well-known location that fits this description, as it contains a wide variety of species that depend on the trees for food and shelter. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where the tree might be located.
Oxygen is a component of the air we breathe. The other options (sky, earth, space shuttle, water) do not contain oxygen in a form that is readily accessible to humans. While the sky and space may contain oxygen in trace amounts, they do not provide a sufficient supply for human consumption. Earth and water do not contain oxygen in a breathable form, and if anything, they may contain harmful contaminants that could be detrimental to human health.
The question is asking about the effect of watching something entertaining on people. The word "entertaining" suggests that the activity is enjoyable and fun, which means that the answer should also reflect this sentiment. The other options, such as "hospitality" and "intelligence," do not have a clear connection to the context of the question and do not make sense as a result. Therefore, the correct answer is "fun."
The phrase "on tilt" refers to being emotionally frustrated or upset while playing poker, which can lead to making poor decisions and losing more hands. The fact that the person is losing hand after hand further emphasizes their frustration, which is often associated with anger. None of the other options suggest a negative emotional state or a correlation with losing in a game.
A runway is a long, narrow strip used for planes to take off and land at an airport or military base. However, in the context of the question, the term "runway head" is likely referring to the beginning of a fashion runway where models begin their walk. This is a common term in the fashion industry, and the other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that acrobats are performing somewhere and may need a launching platform for their act. The most logical answer would be a circus, as acrobats are commonly associated with circus performances and are known to use various props and platforms to enhance their performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to acrobatics or launching platforms.
When an airplane hits the ground, it often experiences a high amount of force and impact, which can cause it to catch on fire due to the ignition of fuel or electrical systems. While the other options may apply to airplanes in different situations, such as accelerating during takeoff or carrying freight during a cargo flight, they do not accurately describe the result of a plane crashing to the ground.
The sentence suggests that the dilemma involves a choice between a chicken and something else related to it. The most common association between chicken and another option is probably eggs, which are often produced by chickens. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is likely near a body of water where they can throw a coin. This would typically be a lake or river, as these are common locations where people can engage in activities like fishing, boating, or picnicking by the shore. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a person throwing a coin into the water.
The sentence suggests that the person does not have raw ingredients, which typically means they do not have the necessary components to prepare a meal from scratch. The options "cook food" and "prepare food" imply that the person has ingredients, which is not the case in this situation. "Buy food" is the most logical choice since it allows the person to purchase ready-to-eat or pre-made meals without needing raw ingredients, while "have food" is too vague and does not provide a clear solution to the problem.
The sentence suggests that there is a process that new students have to go through in order to start attending school. The most common process for this is registration, where the student provides information about themselves to the school's administration. The other options, like being old enough or putting on shoes, are not related to the process of starting school.
The sentence suggests that lizards have the ability to regrow a body part if it is cut off, which is a characteristic commonly associated with their tails. Lizards are known for their unique ability to regenerate their tails as a means of self-defense and survival. The other options do not have any clear connection to this characteristic of lizards.
The phrase "If you get something" suggests that the statement is referring to acquiring or receiving something. The phrase "you'll then have it" is a common expression meaning that you will possess or own the item in question. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "graveyard" suggests that the location is specifically used for burying the dead. With the exception of "on the ocean," all of the other choices could have graveyards, but "arlington" is well-known for having a very large graveyard - Arlington National Cemetery. This is a significant landmark in the United States that is commonly associated with military burials and honors. The other options lack this same level of specificity and significance.
The word "reproduction" in the question suggests that the answer is something that is made to resemble or imitate an original document. The word "copy" is the most commonly used term to refer to a duplicated version of an original document, whereas the other choices have more specific meanings. "Remake" suggests something that has been remade or redone from an original, "mimeograph" is a specific type of printing machine, and "derivative" implies that something has come from or is based on an original source but is not an exact reproduction.
The question asks for a person's immediate reaction to winning the lottery. The phrase "immediate reaction" implies that the person's response would be instantaneous, and the phrase "winning the lottery" suggests that the person would be experiencing a positive outcome. Therefore, the correct answer would be "feel lucky" as this is the most logical and expected response to winning the lottery. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
The use of the word "small" in the question indicates that the falling episode may not have been severe enough to result in broken bones or serious injury. However, falling can often result in pain, even if it's just a minor discomfort. The option "getting hurt contact with" is not grammatically correct, and "going down" is a vague option that does not specify the outcome of the falling episode.
Poker is a type of card game commonly played in designated areas known as card rooms. These spaces are often found in casinos or other gambling establishments and are specifically designed for playing poker. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and placing a poker table in the middle of the road or at a neighbor's house would not be practical or appropriate.
The sentence suggests that cleaning what you eat leads to some positive outcome. Cleaning what you eat likely refers to washing fruits and vegetables before consumption, which is a common practice to remove dirt, pesticides, and bacteria. A clean diet is considered an essential aspect of healthy living as it reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses and promotes good digestion. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Beavers are an iconic animal of Canada and are even depicted on the Canadian nickel. Ontario is a province in Canada known for its vast forests and waterways, making it a perfect habitat for beavers. Woodlands and rivers are also habitats where beavers can be found, but they are not specific enough to choose as the answer. The zoo is not a country or a habitat where beavers are typically found in the wild.
The context of the question suggests that horses with jockeys are likely to be found engaged in some sort of racing activity. The word "jockey" typically refers to someone who rides horses professionally or in a competitive context, which makes the race track the most logical answer. The other options (magazines, countryside, fair, kept in barn stalls) do not have any clear connection to horse racing.
The sentence suggests that a notepad can be useful for keeping track of agenda items during a particular type of event. While a notepad can be used in many different situations, the word "agenda" is key here, as it suggests that the event in question is likely a meeting of some sort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Since the person doesn't have a car, the most likely mode of transportation would be using public transportation, such as a bus. A bus stop would be the best option for the person to get to their destination. The other options are unlikely to provide the transportation needed to get somewhere without a car.
The sentence suggests that Sam had left and his sister was still angry about it. The phrase "planning to return" implies that he had gone away and was planning to come back. The other options do not relate to leaving and returning, making "going away" the only appropriate choice.
Mammoths are extinct animals that lived during the prehistoric era, which is the period of time before written history. They are often studied by scientists, and their fossils are displayed at museums of natural history. While "ancient times" is a vague description and could technically refer to any time in the past, "prehistoric times" is a specific and accurate answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that the group sat down on stools with the intention of ordering something. This is often associated with restaurants or bars, where customers order drinks while sitting on stools. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "fart" is an inappropriate choice.
The sentence suggests that exposure to a virus has a negative effect on people, as it is asking what happens when they are exposed. Getting sick is a commonly associated consequence of exposure to a virus, as viruses can cause illness and disease. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this context.

The context suggests that John set aside the gun because it wasn't helpful in his current situation, which is implied to involve being in a cold environment. The sentence also states that he needed to build a fire, which would be useful for keeping warm. Therefore, the correct answer is "warm up". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "if everyone is loving another" suggests a scenario where there is universal love and harmony between individuals. In such a scenario, it is reasonable to assume that there would be an absence of conflict or violence, leading to peace. The other options- marriage, satisfaction, heartache, and happiness- do not necessarily follow from the given scenario.
The question is asking for the opposite of "hands." Hands and feet are commonly recognized as pairs of body parts that are located at opposite ends of the body, so it makes sense that "feet" would be the opposite of "hands." Toes, legs, and even "body part" are not necessarily opposite to hands, as they do not refer specifically to paired body parts located on opposite ends of the body.
Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints and acts as a cushion between bones. It is also found in various other parts of the body, such as the nose, ears, and spinal column. Muscle and flesh are soft tissues that cover and attach to bones but do not specifically cover them. Skin covers the outermost layer of the body but does not directly cover bones. Matter is a more generic term that could potentially refer to anything in the body, but does not specifically relate to bone covering.
The question is asking for something that can be used to plan a driving route to the Pacific Ocean. An atlas is a book of maps that can help in this process. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question. Drawings may not provide enough detail for a driving route, San Francisco Bay is just one location and not relevant to a general route to the Pacific Ocean, West is too general, and the Southern Hemisphere is not relevant to driving to the Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere.
A music store is a common place to buy musical instruments, including pianos. Music schools and concert halls may have pianos available for purchase, but they are not typically known for selling instruments. A neighbor's house would not be a legitimate option for purchasing a piano, and a symphony orchestra drawing room is not a common location for instrument sales.
The sentence suggests that having a sizable lunch has a specific result. "Feeling full" is the most appropriate answer since it is a common sensation associated with eating a sizeable meal. The other choices are either unrelated or have negative associations (e.g. giving up, obesity) that do not fit with the context of the sentence.
Popcorn is a common snack that is often associated with movie theaters, where it is a popular option for moviegoers. While popcorn can be found in other public places, such as at sporting events like soccer games, the context suggests that the most likely place to find popcorn in this scenario is at a movie theater. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking where olives can be stored to keep them fresh. The choice "jar" could work, but it is not clear if the jar needs to be stored in a specific place. "Pressed for their oil" is not relevant to storing olives. "Ice box" is an outdated term for a refrigerator, so it could work. "Pizza" is not a storage option. "Refrigerator" is the clearest choice as it specifically refers to a place where food can be stored to keep it fresh.
Birds typically leave their nest by spreading their wings and flying away. This is a natural and instinctive behavior for most bird species. Singing songs and laying eggs are not related to leaving the nest, while falling down is a potential but unlikely way for a bird to leave the nest. Reproduction is also not related to leaving the nest as it is a separate process that occurs before the young birds hatch and learn to fly.
The sentence suggests that being seated all day is associated with an office job. Therefore, the correct answer must be something that is related to comfort while sitting. A chair would be the most likely option for providing comfort in this scenario. The other options are not related to sitting nor are they likely to provide comfort for long periods of time.
The sentence suggests that the person had an addiction to the act of shopping and not to actually owning or using the products. This implies that the person was mainly after the experience of spending money rather than the satisfaction of owning or using the products. Option "interacting" doesn't fit the context of the sentence. Option "bankruptcy" is the consequence of excessive spending, not the motive. Option "agony" is unrelated and doesn't make sense. Option "owning" is the opposite of what is suggested by the sentence.
Going to the market typically involves shopping for goods such as produce, meats, or crafts. The other options such as meeting new people or eating samples could also be potential results but are not guaranteed. Tedium would only be a result if the person finds shopping boring and bankruptcy is a drastic outcome that is not necessarily linked to going to the market.
The question implies that someone is looking to find relief from the heat, even if they are unable to swim or have allergies. "Cool off" is the most logical option because it offers a solution to beating the heat without requiring swimming or causing an allergic reaction. "Dive", "buy beer", and "wear shorts" are all unlikely solutions or may even exacerbate the problem, and while "eat ice cream" may provide temporary relief, it is not the most effective or practical solution for cooling off.
The sentence implies that the crab is on land and needs to cross something to reach the ocean. Out of the given options, the shore line is the most likely answer as it refers to the boundary between land and sea. The other options (lakes, shallow waters, tidepools, and the Atlantic ocean) do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not require a crossing from land or are not relevant to the location being described.
The sentence suggests that getting drunk is not a desirable experience for everyone, and lists the potential negative outcome of getting drunk as a clue to the answer. Some people experience nausea or vomiting when they consume too much alcohol, making it an unpleasant experience for them. The other options are not commonly associated with the negative effects of drinking too much alcohol, except for death which is a more extreme and rare outcome.
The sentence implies that the person is more hungry than thirsty, so it would be best for them to eat before drinking. Eating would provide nourishment and help satisfy their hunger, while drinking alone may not be sufficient. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Bald eagles are a symbol of America, and they are often found near bodies of water where they can hunt fish. Wisconsin has many lakes and rivers where bald eagles nest and hunt. Wisconsin is also known for its dairy industry and cheese production, making it a likely choice for the second part of the question. The other options do not have a clear association with bald eagles or cheese.
The sentence suggests that spending too much time buying products can lead to negative consequences related to money. Debt is a common consequence of overspending or spending more than one can afford. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a secure and reliable investment. The term "underdog" often refers to someone or something with lower chances of success. Therefore, it would not make sense that this person would invest their money there. On the other hand, a "safe bet" is a secure and reliable investment, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the torpedo was fired from an unseen location, which is a common tactic used by submarines in naval warfare. Submarines are known for their stealth capabilities and ability to attack other ships while remaining hidden underwater. The other options, such as patrol boats or frigates, do not have the same level of stealth and are less likely to be able to launch an unseen attack with a torpedo.
The sentence suggests that the characteristic being referred to is used to distinguish humans from each other, which rules out options like ears and bladders that all humans have. Feelings are a subjective experience and cannot be used to identify individuals, while naval is an anatomical feature that is not unique to each person. Names, on the other hand, are given to individuals as identifiers and are unique to each person, making them the correct answer.
Alcohol affects the central nervous system, including the areas of the brain that control speech and coordination. Slurred speech is a common side effect of drinking too much, as the tongue and lips become less coordinated and precise in their movements. Pass out, forgetfulness, and stumbling may also occur, but they are not specifically related to the ability to speak. Death is a severe but rare consequence of alcohol consumption, and it does not typically manifest as an inability to talk to others.
The sentence suggests that the traveler is looking for a place to stay, which would typically be a hotel or motel. The options "in a palace" and "Mexico" are too specific and do not apply to all locations. "Every country" is also too broad and unlikely to be true. "Town" is a logical option as hotels are commonly found in urban areas, particularly in town centers where there are many shops and restaurants. "Motel" is also a logical option as they are specifically designed for travelers who need a place to stay on a budget.
The context of the sentence suggests that the green beans are being prepared for consumption, which means they would likely be placed on a plate before being eaten. The other options, such as the bathroom or container, do not make sense in this context. The farmer's market may be where the green beans were purchased, but it is not directly connected to the act of eating them. The mouth is where the beans end up, not where they are found before eating.
The sentence contrasts the timid friend with the trouble the others got into, suggesting that their behavior was opposite to hers. The word "reckless" means acting without thinking about the consequences, which would be a direct contrast to the timid behavior of the friend. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence as they do not suggest an opposite behavior to being timid.
The word "amiable" suggests that the solution they arrived at was friendly and pleasant, but the word "problem" suggests that there was some difficulty or challenge that needed to be resolved. The word "disagreeable" acknowledges that the problem was not easy or straightforward, but the solution was still reached in a friendly and agreeable manner. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not relate to the problem or suggest a negative outcome.
Going to a concert typically involves listening to music, dancing, and enjoying the performance of the artist on stage. This usually involves cheering, clapping, and making noise to show appreciation and excitement for the music. Making time, payments, hay, or peace do not have any relevance to the context of a concert.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to drink alcohol and unwind after a difficult day. Bars are commonly associated with serving alcoholic beverages, making it the most likely option. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Furthermore, a graveyard or cemetery would not be an appropriate location to drink alcohol.
The sentence suggests that fresh baked cookies are a common occurrence at Grandma's place, which is likely to be her house. The other options (fridge, jar, plate, pantry) are unlikely, as they do not necessarily indicate a place where fresh baked cookies are found. A fridge implies a refrigerated space, jars and plates are storage vessels, and a pantry is usually a room for storing non-perishable food items.
The sentence suggests that the person had been unemployed for a long time and finally had an interview for a job opportunity. It is likely that the person would feel relieved and motivated to work hard in order to secure the job. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect a positive outcome of the interview. Nausea, rejection, frustration, and stress are all negative emotions that the person might feel if the interview did not go well.
The sentence suggests that the location of the rug is a place where many people walk and eat popcorn, which is commonly associated with a living room. Living rooms are often the central gathering place in a home where people relax, socialize, and watch TV, making it likely that the rug would see a lot of foot traffic and have popcorn scattered about. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that there is a specific location where a coin can be placed in order to prevent a car from being towed. A parking meter is a likely choice because it is common for drivers to pay for parking with coins inserted into the meter. The other options, such as a piggy bank, wishing well, change purse, or slot machine, have no connection to the context of the question and do not provide any indication of a place to put a coin to prevent a car from being towed.
The sentence suggests that there are consequences for expressing oneself without pants in public, which is likely to be a violation of indecent exposure laws. "Getting arrested" is the most likely outcome in this scenario. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the behavior of the kids is not considered ordinary or normal by others. The word "kooky" is often used to describe people or behavior that is eccentric or unconventional. The phrase "to them" indicates that the kids themselves view their behavior as perfectly acceptable, which reinforces the idea that their behavior is not typical. The other options imply that their behavior is unremarkable or conformist, which contradicts the meaning of the sentence.
The context suggests that the drawstring bag contains valuable stones, and it would make sense for valuable stones to be purchased or acquired from a jewelry store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the gift in question was popular and common, which suggests that it would be widely available in a commercial setting rather than a personal space like a closet. Additionally, the mention of heading somewhere suggests that the person is looking for a specific location or type of store, and a department store is a common location for purchasing gifts due to its wide range of products. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as a christmas tree and stocking are not places to buy gifts, and a specialty store may not carry a widely popular gift item.
When someone eats a big dinner and stops eating because they feel satisfied, they are likely experiencing a feeling of fullness. This occurs when the stomach stretches to accommodate the food and sends signals to the brain that it is time to stop eating. The other options, such as weight gain, nausea, and upset stomach, are unlikely to be associated with a feeling of pleasantness or satisfaction after a meal. "Not hungry" is also not the best option since it does not describe a pleasant sensation, but rather a lack of appetite.
The sentence suggests that the teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, so the answer must be related to the concept of housework. The option "boredom" does not make sense as something that impresses someone, while "chores" is too general and does not differentiate the teen's actions from regular housework. "Allergies" and "pain and suffering" are negative experiences that the girlfriend is unlikely to be impressed by. Therefore, the most logical answer is "cleanliness," which is the outcome of doing housework and could be seen as a positive trait in a partner.
The context of the sentence indicates that the person is at school, which suggests that they may have access to a cafeteria or dining hall. The other options (home, under the cow) are not relevant to the context of being at school. The option "menu" may be helpful in finding out if milk is available in the cafeteria, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question. "Accompaniment to meal" is also not specific enough, as there may be other options besides milk that are served with meals.
The sentence suggests that James's lies were not convincing and that he was laughed at, indicating that he was embarrassed by the situation. The other options imply legal consequences, which are not mentioned in the sentence. Perjury is a crime that can result in indictment, penalty, or jail time, but the sentence does not provide any evidence that James faced any of these consequences.
The Milky Way is a galaxy, a huge collection of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is stars as they are the main component of the Milky Way. The other options such as candy or a refrigerator are not related to the context of the question and can be eliminated as incorrect answers.
The question asks for the location of North Carolina, so the answer will provide a specific location rather than a general category like "United States" or "Carolina." The phrase "north of South Carolina" provides a clear geographic location and suggests that North Carolina is located above (or north of) its southern neighbor. The option "south" is incorrect because it does not provide a specific location and could refer to any number of places. The option "south of Virginia" is incorrect because it places North Carolina in the wrong position relative to another state.
The question is asking for the body part that a head is attached to. The word "attached" suggests a physical connection, which implies that the head is anchored or supported by something else. The term "base" is commonly used to refer to the part of an object that serves as its foundation or support, such as the base of a statue or the base of a lamp. The other options (home, subordinate, foot, point) do not make logical sense in the context of the question.
The context suggests that the question is asking where someone might stop at a gift shop while checking out, which implies that they are leaving a location. Among the choices given, the airport is the most likely option for someone to be leaving from, as they would be checking out of their flight or returning home after a trip. The other options (hotel, Disneyland, train station, museum) do not necessarily involve leaving a location, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the teacher was frustrated because the student gave an incorrect answer. The teacher then offered advice to the student by telling them to "just listen." This strongly suggests that the correct answer is related to learning through listening. The phrase "you'll learn" fits this context perfectly, as it conveys the idea that by paying attention and listening carefully, the student will be able to learn and improve. The other options do not make sense in this context, and are not related to the idea of learning through listening.
The sentence suggests that James was installing something overhead, which is likely to be lights. The context also mentions thunder and lightning, which further supports that the correct answer is "lighting." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Erin was not successful in being entertaining, which may imply that she was not particularly funny or charismatic. Therefore, she may have wanted people to laugh at her in order to feel validated and appreciated. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cashing in your chips at a casino usually means that you have won money. Therefore, the casino owner would feel satisfied that you have contributed to their profits by gambling and ultimately losing money. The option "leave" is irrelevant because it does not demonstrate any emotional response from the casino owner. The options "betrayal," "resentment," and "revenge" imply negative feelings towards the player, which are not likely to occur if the player brought in a profit for the casino.
The sentence implies that the mascot of a weasel is associated with someone or something that is untrustworthy or sneaky. Public office is a common target of criticism and distrust, so it would be a likely place for someone to assign the weasel mascot. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A contralto is a type of singing voice, specifically the lowest female singing voice type. The context of the sentence suggests that attending an event where a contralto is being enjoyed would likely be a musical performance or concert, rather than a more casual gathering like a fun or choir practice. The options "describe singing voice" and "chorus" are partially correct, as they both relate to singing, but do not specifically indicate an event or performance.
Spiders are known for creating webs in various locations to catch their prey, and this is a characteristic commonly associated with spiders. Basements and cellars may be dark and damp environments where other animals may live, but spiders typically do not live in these spaces. Trees and mailboxes are not typical habitats for spiders, although some species may make their homes in trees.
A sentence is a string of words that contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. It is considered the basic unit of communication in written and spoken language. A proper noun is a specific name for a person, place, or thing, which can be used as the subject in a sentence. The other options do not accurately describe the structure of a sentence. A phrase is a group of words that does not contain a subject and verb, while a dictionary is a reference book that contains definitions of words. English and language are too broad and general to accurately describe the specific structure of a sentence.
The use of "seat" and "vibrates" suggest that the question is referring to a specific type of seat found in a specific location. Seats that vibrate are often associated with movie theaters or cinemas that offer 4D or immersive movie experiences. The other options do not typically have seats that vibrate, making "in cinema" the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for something beyond just a definition, which could be found in a thesaurus. A thesaurus provides synonyms and related words to the one being looked up, which can help in expanding one's vocabulary and understanding of a word. The other options like a novel, encyclopedia, or see work do not necessarily aid in providing alternate words or expanding one's vocabulary. "Determine word's definition" is redundant as the person was already using a dictionary for that purpose.
When you wear too many clothes while hiking, your body may become overheated and start to sweat excessively. This can lead to discomfort, dehydration, and even heat exhaustion or heat stroke in extreme cases. The other options do not have a logical connection to the context of the question.
Marmots are commonly found in the Alps, which are located in Switzerland as well as some neighboring countries. The other choices do not have a strong connection to the habitat of marmots. American forest and North America are too broad and do not specify a particular region where marmots may be found. Northern climates may include areas where marmots live, but the term is too general. New Zealand, on the other hand, is too far from the natural habitat of marmots.
The question is asking where someone can borrow magazines, which suggests a location where magazines are available for loan. Libraries are well-known for offering a wide variety of reading materials, including magazines, for borrowing. Bookstores and friends do not typically offer borrowing services, while tables and doctors are not commonly associated with magazine borrowing.
The phrase "hitting the bottle" is a colloquialism for drinking alcohol excessively. The consequences of drinking too much alcohol the night before can result in a hangover, which is characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, and dehydration. While some of the other options may be associated with drinking, such as alcoholism or drunkenness, only hangover specifically refers to the effects of consuming alcohol.
The sentence suggests James is seeking a deeper understanding or knowledge of something through contemplation. "New insights" seems the most fitting choice as it implies a fresh understanding or perspective gained through reflection. "Revelations" and "enlightenment" imply a more profound experience, while "hesitation" and "lessons" do not seem to align with the sentence's context.
The force that keeps objects on the surface of the earth is gravity. Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects, in this case, the earth and any objects on its surface. Tectonic plates are responsible for the movement of the earth's crust, the sun and one moon are celestial bodies that orbit the earth, and the four seasons are caused by the earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the sun. None of these options are related to the force that keeps objects on the surface of the earth.
The sentence implies that the doorways in question are designed for vehicles to drive through, which is a common feature of airport entrances. Airports often have drop-off areas or valet parking where vehicles can pull up directly to the entrance to unload passengers and luggage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Athletes typically prepare for games in locker rooms, where they can change into their uniforms, review game plans, receive medical treatments, and mentally prepare for the competition. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "between periods of instruction" suggests that the context of this question pertains to a school setting. Binders are typically used to organize class materials, and it is common for students to carry them in backpacks between classes. The other options, such as a car, office supply store or bookcase, are not relevant to the context of the question. The classroom may be a possible option, but it is not specific enough to indicate where the binder should be kept between periods of instruction.
The sentence suggests that even though there is a lot of automation in factories, the essential aspect of it is still related to human workers. The heart and soul of a factory refers to the human element that is responsible for creativity, innovation, and problem solving. The other options do not fit in the sentence's context and do not relate to the idea of human input that is essential for factories.
The sentence suggests that bathing five times a day had negative consequences for Lilly's health or wellbeing. Bathing frequently can strip the skin of its natural oils and moisture, leading to dryness and irritation. Over time, this can cause damage to the skin, making it more vulnerable to external factors like sun damage and pollution. Cleanliness is not an issue in this sentence since bathing is already being mentioned, and nudity or tension to ease are not relevant either.
Apple trees are commonly found on farms, as they are a common crop grown for commercial purposes. The other options do not suggest any connection to apple trees.
The sentence suggests that the lazy man did not enjoy having to maintain a certain aspect of the house, which is likely to be related to outdoor maintenance. The option 'yard' is the most logical choice, as it requires regular upkeep such as mowing the lawn, trimming bushes, and watering plants. The other options do not require regular outdoor maintenance and are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person had a preconceived notion or assumption about something, but discovering the truth was unexpected and surprising, leading to a feeling of shock. The other options do not fit with the idea of being surprised or caught off guard by something.
The word "want" suggests a desire for something, and in this context, it specifically refers to money. The word "selfish" implies a focus on personal gain without regard for others, which may or may not be related to the desire for money. "Weird" and "ridiculous" are both subjective judgments that do not necessarily relate to wanting money. "Hungry" typically refers to a physical need for food rather than a desire for money. "Greedy" specifically refers to a strong desire for more money or material possessions than one needs or deserves, making it the most appropriate choice.
The sentence suggests that the man's comments made the speaker feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. The use of the word "sloppy" implies that the man was criticizing the speaker's behavior, and asking these questions in front of others suggests that the criticism was public. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely emotional response to this scenario.
The sentence suggests that the person started reading to gain a deeper understanding of a subject. Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that pertains to gaining knowledge or understanding. "Advance knowledge to understanding" is the most fitting choice as it directly relates to gaining a deeper understanding. The other options relate to different aspects of education or other concepts unrelated to the acquisition of knowledge.
Confetti is typically thrown into the air during celebrations or events, where it will float and scatter before falling to the ground. This makes "air" the most logical choice among the options provided. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is feeling isolated and lonely on campus, indicating a desire for social connection. The phrase "with someone" directly addresses that desire for companionship. The other options do not directly address the need for companionship and may even exacerbate feelings of isolation (e.g. "confined").
A conference is a gathering of professionals or experts in a particular field or industry. It is a place where people can connect, network and share ideas with others in the same profession. The other options, such as a theater, a supermarket, a town, or a cinema, do not offer the same opportunities to meet and connect with people in the same profession.
White mice are commonly used in research laboratories as they are easily bred and have a high reproductive rate. They are often used for experiments related to genetics, behavior, and disease research. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the typical habitat or use of white mice.
The mention of men in robes suggests a religious setting, which is further supported by the option "church." Wine and crackers are commonly served during religious ceremonies such as communion, making church the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When a car hits a curb at high speed, it can cause the wheels to hit the curb and then come down forcefully, which is known as "bottoming out." This can cause damage to the underside of the car and may also affect the alignment of the wheels. Rolling over is also a possibility if the car hits the curb at a certain angle or speed, but it is less likely based on the wording of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location where one would read magazines while waiting for winged transportation is a place where people board flights. The only choice that is related to transportation and features flights is the airport. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the lock was used as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to the school. The most likely place for a lock in this context would be at the front entrance, which is the main access point for the school. The other options do not make sense in the context of a school and are unlikely places for a lock to be used.
The sentence suggests that the man's behavior was not appropriate for the situation. It mentions that he laughed during a funeral, which is typically a somber occasion. The other options do not match the context of the sentence.
The word "submerges" suggests that the clothing is being fully immersed in water, which would likely result in the clothing becoming thoroughly wet or "drenched." The other options do not accurately describe what would happen to clothing when submerged in water.
The sentence implies that the location being referred to is a port city on the west coast of the U.S. where ships from the Pacific Ocean unload their cargo. San Francisco Bay is a well-known port in California, situated on the west coast of the U.S. and known for its large-scale commercial operations, shipping, and maritime industries. The other options, such as northwest, southern hemisphere, west, and atlas, do not fit the specific criteria set forth in the sentence.
Potatoes need to be stored in a cool, dark and dry place to prevent sprouting and rotting. A cellar is a common storage place for potatoes as it provides the right conditions for long-term preservation. The other options such as countryside, sliced, restaurant, and fried are not relevant to the storage of potatoes for the winter.
The sentence suggests that the human had a desire for something sexual in nature, which is often associated with strip clubs as they feature exotic dancers. The other options, such as the space shuttle or international space station, have no clear connection to fulfilling lustful needs. The church is typically associated with suppressing such desires, so it would be an unlikely choice. "Anywhere on earth" is too general and does not provide any specific context to make a knowledgeable choice.
A card catalog is a tool used for organizing and locating materials in libraries or other information resource centers. Therefore, options such as book store and library are likely to use a card catalog. On the other hand, a store might use a digital catalogue, but a card catalog is less likely. The kitchen has no relevance to information or resources, making it an unlikely location to use a card catalog.
The sentence suggests that after studying, the person came to the conclusion that there was something more than just man's brain at work. The phrase "made sense" indicates that a logical conclusion was reached. The option "higher intelligence" fits well as it suggests something beyond the normal intelligence of a human being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A mechanic is someone who works with machines, particularly in repairing and maintaining them. The options "washing a car" and "servicing airplane" are specific tasks that may be performed by a mechanic, but they do not encompass the full scope of their work. "Oil engine" suggests a specific type of machine, while "machine tool" refers to a specific category of machines used in manufacturing processes. "Machine parts" is the most general option that encompasses the types of machines a mechanic would be likely to work with.
The sentence suggests that the student is interested in learning about past events. "Study history" is a specific and direct answer that addresses this question, while the other options do not provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand. "Pass course," "better grade," "complete test," "ask questions," and "answer question" are all related to completing a course or an assignment, but none of them indicate a desire to learn about past events specifically.
The context of the question suggests that meeting new people can be a nerve-wracking experience, which is commonly associated with feelings of anxiety or nervousness. While some people may feel excited about the prospect of making new friends, the question specifies "most people," so this option is less likely to be the correct answer. "Being bored" and "love" are not associated with meeting new people, so they can be eliminated as well. "Happy" is also not the best fit in this scenario, as meeting new people can be a stressful experience for many individuals.
The sentence implies that the person is experiencing remorse or a sense of guilt about their actions, which is commonly associated with feeling bad. Deception and schizophrenia have no clear connection to remorse or regret, while living in poverty and indigestion are unlikely to be related to the person's emotional state.
The phrase "throwing fruit" suggests that the argument may have turned into a physical altercation, which could have made the situation even more intense or heated. The phrase "go off" is often used to describe a situation that escalates or becomes chaotic, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking for a way to relieve stress with friends, and hanging out at a bar with friends is a common activity that can help to relieve stress. Socializing with friends has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health and can provide a sense of support, which can be helpful in managing stress. Running may also be a stress-relieving activity, but it is not specifically related to being with friends. Drinking alcohol may initially relieve stress, but can ultimately make the problem worse in the long run. Cleaning the house and dreaming are not social activities that involve being with friends.
The sentence suggests that small unpaved lanes can be found somewhere, and the options given provide different locations where they might be found. A city is unlikely to have many small unpaved lanes, as most streets in a city are paved. A bowling alley is an indoor location and has nothing to do with small unpaved lanes. Highways are large and often paved, so they are not likely to have small unpaved lanes either. Estonia is a country and not a location where small unpaved lanes might be found. Therefore, the correct answer is rural countryside, as small unpaved lanes are a common feature of rural areas.
The sentence suggests that the reason why the teacher yelled at her students is related to their talking behavior. Talking too much in class is commonly considered as disruptive and can negatively impact other students' learning. Therefore, it's likely that the teacher scolded her students for not following the classroom rules or for distracting others with their talking. The other options, such as answering questions, teaching children or opening boxes, do not seem to be valid reasons for the teacher's outburst.
The sentence suggests that the author is looking for the best Japanese restaurant, and based on this, we can infer that the restaurant is likely to be located in an area with a high concentration of Japanese culture and cuisine. Downtown areas of major cities often have districts or neighborhoods that are known for their diverse cuisine, including Japanese cuisine. The other options do not specify any particular area known for Japanese cuisine and culture.
The sentence describes John's worry about the potential risks of football, specifically mentioning his fear of the consequences of his sport. The fact that the concussion was less scary than something else suggests that the other option must be even more severe or dangerous. Out of the remaining choices, death is the most severe outcome and the one that would likely cause the most fear and concern. The other options do not convey the same sense of severity or potential danger.
The question implies that effective communication between two people requires a specific action or skill. While opening one's mouth and having a voice are necessary for speaking, they are not sufficient for effective communication as one can talk without being listened to or understood. A translator may help two people from different language backgrounds communicate, but it is not a requirement for effective communication between two people who share the same language. Therefore, the answer must be listening, which involves actively paying attention to what the other person is saying and responding appropriately.
The sentence suggests that buying beer at the store will have a negative impact on your wealth, which implies that it will cost you money to make the purchase. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: relaxation and pleasure may be outcomes of buying beer, but they don't address the impact on wealth; getting arrested is unlikely to result from simply buying beer. Wealth increasing would require additional information or context not provided in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the mother is prepared for her children's messy habits by keeping extra tissues handy. Since the question specifically mentions a "purse," it suggests that this is where the mother keeps the tissues. The other options like "pocket" or "box" do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not suggest a place where someone would keep extra tissues for easy access.
The sentence describes Jim fiddling in a barn while couples are present, suggesting that they are likely engaged in some kind of dancing activity. The use of the word "ritualistically" further implies that this is some kind of traditional or cultural dance, rather than simply "making music". "Attacking him" is unlikely given the lack of any indication of conflict, and "discovery" is not relevant to the context. "Square dancing" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide enough information to indicate a specific type of dance. "Dancing about" is the most general, neutral option that fits with the context provided.
Driving accidents typically involve collisions or crashes between vehicles, which can result in injuries to the drivers and passengers involved. Traffic jams may result from accidents, but they are not a likely consequence for the individuals involved in the accident. Rainbows, boredom, and fatigue are not related to driving accidents.
A jar is a good place to store water because it is a container designed for holding liquids. The other options, such as a toilet or a boot, are not designed for storing water and could potentially contaminate the water or cause it to spill. A bridge or an ocean are not containers and cannot store water.
Storing a fortune typically refers to keeping a large sum of money safe for future use or investment. Banks are the most common place for people to store their money, as they offer secure and regulated financial services, such as savings accounts and investment options. The other options, such as imagination, cookie, treasure chest, and gold, do not offer any practical or logical method of storing large amounts of money.
The question is asking for a reason why someone would not be able to buy beer. The choice "have no money" directly addresses this question and is a commonly known reason people may not be able to purchase a desired item. The other choices may not have a clear connection to the context of the question or provide a reason for why someone cannot buy beer.
The phrase "groovy moves" implies that the context is about dancing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that practicing "groovy moves" will result in the ability to dance well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the way couples have fun is something that involves both partners and is enjoyable for both. Laughter is a common activity that can be shared and enjoyed together, especially in the context of relationship or marriage. The other options may not necessarily involve both partners or may not be universally enjoyable for all couples.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is using hair styling gel, which is a personal grooming product commonly stored in the bathroom or on a bathroom vanity. The other options (tube, outside, store, refrigerator) do not make sense in the context of storing hair styling gel.
A chess board is a game commonly found in toy stores, game stores, and hobby shops. The other options do not have any obvious connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the body part being referred to serves multiple functions. Out of the choices, only ten fingers fit this description as they are used for both fine motor skills (e.g. typing, writing) and gross motor skills (e.g. gripping, lifting). The other options either do not serve multiple functions or do not have an abundance in humans (e.g. laying eggs).
The phrase "waiting room for lost luggage" suggests that the location is within an airport, since this is where luggage is typically lost or delayed during travel. The other options do not have any clear connection to lost luggage, waiting rooms, or airports.
A small registry office is likely to be located in a town rather than a city or office building, as it serves a smaller population and would not require a large building or a central location like city offices usually do. A court house would not typically be referred to as a registry office, and a merchant is not a location where a registry office would be found.
The sentence suggests that the item in question is a vintage or antique item, as it is being kept in a glass case. Opera glasses were first popularized in the 1800s and early 1900s, making them a likely candidate for an antique item. Since the item is not being sold online (as indicated by the absence of Amazon), the best option is to look for the item in a physical store, such as an antique store or museum. The theater could also be a possible location for opera glasses, but the presence of a glass case suggests that it is a collectible item rather than a functional one.
The question is asking for the closest place where a specific piece of literature can be found. The most likely place would be someone's own home, where they keep their personal belongings. The other options do not make sense in this context: "under the bed" might suggest a hiding spot or a forgotten location, "books and magazines" is too broad and may not contain the specific piece of literature being referred to, "meeting" is unrelated to the question, and "public library" may not be the closest place if the person already owns the literature.
The sentence suggests that Dave is being punished by Josh, but he doesn't mind it. This suggests that Dave may be feeling a sense of satisfaction or justice, which are emotions associated with retribution. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest negative emotions towards the situation.
The sentence suggests that a bus line is a type of a system that is available to the public, which refers to a transportation system. A transportation system is a network of vehicles and infrastructure that allows people and goods to move from one place to another. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence since they are unrelated to the idea of public transit or transportation.
The sentence suggests that the person is learning to play an instrument while spending time in the mountains with locals. The term "fingerboard" is commonly used in reference to the fretboard of a guitar, which is where the person places their fingers to play different notes. The other options may also be played using the fingerboard, but they are less commonly associated with mountain culture and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
Michelin stars are awarded to restaurants based on their culinary excellence, and are often seen as a mark of quality and prestige in the food industry. France has a strong culinary tradition and is home to many Michelin starred restaurants, making it the most likely choice for a restaurant serving blowfish. Japan and the Atlantic ocean could also be possibilities, as both are known for their seafood cuisine, but the context of the sentence does not suggest these options. Fish market and books do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "in crowd guys" suggests that the group in question may be associated with a particular social circle on campus, such as a fraternity. Fraternities are known for hosting parties and events, so the option "fraternity house" is the most likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions displaying a flower on a table, which suggests that the options should be related to indoor spaces. Vase and windowsill are both common choices for displaying flowers on a table. However, a shelf is usually higher up and not as appropriate for a table display. A park and a garden are outdoor spaces and not relevant to the question.
Before a program can exist, it must be written in a programming language such as Java or C++. Once the code is written, it must be compiled into an executable file that the computer can understand and run. Compiling translates the human-readable code into machine code that can be executed by the computer processor. While thinking logically is an important part of programming, it is not a step in creating a program. Getting frustrated is also not a necessary step in the process.
The sentence suggests that gentleman organize something to discuss business, which gives a hint that the correct answer may be related to business meetings. Gentleman is a term used to refer to men who are polite and well-mannered, which could hint at a formal setting for the discussion, such as a meeting. The other options such as club, meditation center, church or clothing do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the Sunday school teacher gave out a punishment in response to something the students did, which was likely a violation of her instructions or rules. The word "disobey" specifically refers to not following an order or instruction, making this the correct answer. The other options imply different types of actions or attitudes, such as stumbling (doing something incorrectly), rebelling (openly opposing authority), going astray (losing direction or focus), or committing sin (doing something morally wrong).
The sentence mentions a new buying product that allows you to purchase as much as you want, which implies that the product is related to shopping. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence - spending money and pleasure are not specific enough, bankruptcy and debt have negative connotations and do not fit the positive tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was contacting the management of a skyscraper, which indicates that the person is likely in or near the building. The choices "library," "kitchen," and "phone booth" are unlikely options for finding a telephone directory related to the building, while "front desk" may be a possibility but not as specific as "building." Therefore, "building" is the most logical choice.
The question specifically asks about where you can learn about marine animals such as sharks, whales, and dolphins. A marine museum is a facility that is dedicated to showcasing marine life and educating the public about the world's oceans. The other options, such as a bad movie, pool hall, or bathtub, do not have any connection to learning about marine life. "Outside" is too broad a category and could refer to anything from a park to a desert.
Jellyfish are marine creatures and are typically found in saltwater environments such as oceans and beaches. Therefore, options like Hawaii and the Pacific Ocean would be likely places to find jellyfish. However, a jellyfish in a Japanese restaurant or bathtub would not be expected and could even be dangerous. This knowledge can help eliminate options and lead to the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the structure being referred to contains multiple homes and has a communal area where a mailbox can be found. The options "beehive" and "porch" do not fit this description, while "post office" would not typically contain multiple homes. "Front door" is too vague and could apply to any building. "Apartment building" is the most likely option that fits the description given in the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Jane sees a bright object outside, which is most likely the sun. The sun is a bright object that can be easily seen outside during daylight hours, whereas the moon is typically visible at night. The ground and nature do not necessarily have any association with a bright object, and the sky is too general of a term to indicate any specific object.
The sentence implies that marmosets are not native to the American West, and the only place to find them would be in a zoo. This implies that they may be found in the wild in other regions, such as in South America where they are commonly found. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A tributary is a small river or stream that flows into a larger river or body of water, and a stream is a type of small flowing waterway that fits this definition. Creeks, inlets, and rivers are also types of flowing waterways, but ponds and lakes are bodies of still water and do not fit the definition of a tributary.
The sentence suggests that the keyboard instrument was being played onstage alongside the drums and guitar, which is commonly associated with bands. Orchestras typically have different types of instruments and do not typically include drums and guitar. Music and piano stores are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and "eating" is not a plausible answer based on the sentence provided.
The sentence suggests that the person is holding an object (an iron) and looking at something in the distance (the basketball hoop). This implies that the person is likely playing or practicing basketball, and their goal is to get the ball into the hoop. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man is looking for a change that is lasting and will not be easily undone. The word "permanent" means lasting or enduring, which fits with the man's desire for a long-term change in his life. The other options do not convey the same sense of lasting change; "concretely" and "constant" refer to the manner or nature of the change, while "remain stable" and "stagnant" suggest a lack of change altogether.
Explanation: The sentence suggests that James enjoys being a judge, but he only has his own perspective to base his judgments on. This implies that James is relying on his personal experience to make judgments, rather than relying on external sources of information. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way - misperception suggests that James may be making incorrect judgments, knowing yourself implies a level of self-awareness that is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, ignorance suggests a lack of knowledge or understanding, and a jury would imply a group of people rather than an individual perspective.
The term "getting in shape" typically refers to improving one's overall physical fitness, which involves engaging in regular physical activity or exercise. While losing weight may be a goal for some people, it is not the only way to get in shape. Sweat may be a byproduct of exercise, but it does not directly contribute to getting in shape. The triangle and good health do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The tourists initially mistook the artwork for a statue, which suggests that it was a realistic representation of something. However, the sentence indicates that the artwork began "moving", which implies that it was actually a performance rather than a static sculpture. The other options (growing mold, accent garden, green, painting) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there are dangers on something that would make shopping there a risk. The options "container," "ocean floor," and "high school" do not make sense in this context. "Downtown area" is a possibility, but not as specific as "roadway," which suggests dangers associated with traffic and cars.
The phrase "stick a key in" implies that the object being referred to has a keyhole, which is commonly found on front doors of houses and buildings. The other options, such as pocket, bus depot, purse, and roof, do not have a clear association with keyholes.
The sentence suggests that the person mentioned has money and is also wearing an extravagant hat, which could suggest that they are going to a place to show off their wealth and take risks. Casinos are known for gambling games and attracting wealthy individuals, while the other options do not have any clear connection to gambling or wealth.
The sentence suggests that James had a negative experience during his illness, which is a characteristic commonly associated with malaise. Malaise is a general feeling of discomfort or unease, often accompanied by fatigue or lack of energy, which could explain why James is happy to be returning to work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that both sides were presenting their arguments as facts, despite the fact that neither side had evidence to support their claims. This implies that both sides were presenting their opinions, rather than objective facts. The word "opinion" is the only choice that accurately reflects this meaning. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Bells are commonly associated with churches, particularly on Sunday mornings when many religious services are held. Bells are used to call worshippers to prayer and mark the beginning or end of services. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of hearing bells on a Sunday morning.
Going into trance can be associated with altered states of consciousness that can lead to hallucinations. Hallucinations involve seeing or perceiving things that are not present in reality, and can occur as a result of various factors including drug use, mental illness, or neurological conditions. Meditating can induce altered states of consciousness but not necessarily hallucinations. Being medicated or confused also do not necessarily lead to hallucinations. Epilepsy can cause seizures but not necessarily hallucinations.
The sentence suggests that the couple is alone and that it's time for a more private activity after a day of celebrating their marriage. "Intimacy" is a word that commonly refers to physical closeness and affection between romantic partners, which would be an appropriate activity for a newlywed couple who are alone together. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "headaches" and "riots" are negative events and "ocean" is unrelated to the situation. "Enjoyment" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and doesn't give any specific information about what the couple will be doing.
The sentence suggests that there is a specific time of day when networks air their most popular bad shows, and the word "prime" is commonly used to describe this time. "Prime time" typically refers to the hours between 8pm and 11pm when television networks air their most popular shows. The other options, such as "true," "just," "badarse," and "trashy," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Spare address labels are a commonly used office supply item that is generally stored in a convenient location that is easily accessible. The options "trash" and "parcel" are unlikely places to find spare address labels, while "junk drawer" and "envelope" could both potentially contain address labels but are not as common storage locations as a "desk drawer".
The question asks where a calendar can be purchased "normally," which suggests that it is referring to a physical paper-based calendar rather than a digital one. Office supply stores are a common place to purchase paper-based calendars since they often sell a variety of office and organizational supplies. The other options (desktop, smartphone, wrist watch, and date book) are all digital or non-paper options for keeping track of dates and appointments.
The sentence suggests that James did not benefit from analyzing all the data, and that it only resulted in a negative outcome. The word "headache" implies that James found the process of analyzing the data to be frustrating or overwhelming, and that it did not lead to any useful insights or better understanding. The other options do not fit with the negative tone of the sentence or suggest a beneficial outcome.
The other choices (sewer, trap, cupboard) are typical places where mice would live, but the question specifies that the mouse is in New York City. The idea of a "mouse condo" in this context is not far-fetched, as many buildings in New York City have apartments that could be compared to a condo for mice. Additionally, the mention of Disneyland is a distractor and not relevant to the question.
The word "composers" refers to individuals who create music. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A bookshelf is typically used to store books or other items, and it is usually found in a room where people read or work. Among the options, the bedroom is the most likely place where a person would have a small bookshelf. This is because many people like to read in bed or have books nearby as they wind down for the night. The bathroom is not a common place for a bookshelf, and neither is a book store or furniture store. While a library would have many bookshelves, it is not a personal location where someone would have their own small bookshelf.
Corn is a crop commonly stored in silos, which are tall cylindrical structures designed for storing grains and other agricultural products. Silos protect the corn from moisture, pests, and other elements, helping to preserve the quality of the crop. The other options are unlikely places to store excess corn, as a storage building may not be designed for grains, a restaurant does not typically store raw ingredients, Pennsylvania is a geographic location, and a supermarket typically purchases corn from suppliers rather than storing excess crops.
The sentence suggests that the object being described has additional adornments or decorations, which makes the option "decorative" the correct answer. The other options are more closely associated with extravagance or excess, rather than simply having adornments. For example, "bells and whistles" suggests that the object has many unnecessary features, while "extravagant" implies that it is luxurious or excessive. "Fancy" and "exotic" can both suggest a sense of uniqueness, but do not necessarily imply additional decorations or adornments.
MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is a renowned institution in the field of science and technology, and is often associated with cutting-edge research and development in high tech fields such as computer science. The other options do not have any clear connection to high tech computers, and instead may be associated with other types of technology (such as a space shuttle for aerospace technology, a library for information technology, a post office for mail delivery, and an internet cafe for general internet access).
The question asks for a possible reason why a driving car might stop, and one common reason is running out of gas. This occurs when the fuel level in the car's tank reaches zero, causing the engine to stop. The other choices are not relevant to the context of a car stopping while driving. "On time" and "pollution" are not causes of a car stopping, while "death" and "sickness" refer to human conditions that would not affect a car.
The question is asking about a southern area where marmosets are found. Marmosets are typically found in Central and South America, which are both part of Latin America. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Debbie was getting a perm when she noticed the ficus, which implies that she was in a place where people go to get their hair done, such as a hair salon. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. An arboretum is a place where one would go to see many different types of plants, a family room would typically not have a plant as part of its decor, and a flower garden would not commonly have a ficus tree growing in it. The option "in the sink" is clearly not a valid choice given the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the tree is unable to spread its roots further, which implies a physical barrier preventing it from doing so. The option "wall in" is the only one that refers to a physical obstruction that could limit root growth in a garden. The other options, such as weather, growth patterns, and emotions, do not provide any explanation for why the tree's roots would stop spreading.
Drinking alcohol at a bar is typically associated with socializing with friends or meeting new people. Dancing may also be popular, but it is not the most common activity associated with drinking at a bar. Becoming inebriated, urinating, and sleeping at night are negative outcomes of drinking too much alcohol and do not necessarily reflect what people are more likely to do when they drink at a bar.
The sentence suggests that the baby arrived unexpectedly, meaning it was not due at that time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "arrive early." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Died" is too extreme and not indicated by the sentence. "Boy or girl" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and the baby's gender is not mentioned. "Learn to walk" is not something a baby would do immediately after being born. "Talk nonsense" is unlikely for a newborn baby.
An upright piano is typically a piece of furniture found in a home or living space rather than in a band, college or a moving truck. The most logical place to find an upright piano would be in the living room of a building that you live in. While a house could also be a correct answer, it is not necessarily the only type of building where one might find an upright piano.
The sentence mentions the "MTV-made famous shore", which is a reference to the reality TV show "Jersey Shore". The show was set in New Jersey, specifically in the town of Seaside Heights, which is known for its beach and boardwalk. The sentence also mentions "the motorway and famous turnpike", which are both major highways in the northeastern United States, particularly in New Jersey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Anger is often associated with built-up energy or tension in the body, so releasing that energy can be an effective way to manage it. This can be done through physical exercise, such as going for a run or doing yoga, or engaging in activities that help release pent-up emotion, such as hitting a pillow or screaming into a pillow. Writing a letter or punching something may provide temporary relief, but they don't address the root cause of the anger or help release the energy associated with it. Passing a sentence has no clear connection to managing anger.
The word "need" implies that there is something that the individual lacks or requires in order to feel complete or whole. When a need is fulfilled, the person is likely to feel satisfied, as their requirement has been met. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive or negative outcome, and they do not specifically address the idea of having a need met.
The question suggests that religion is a type of group, and the sentence also mentions that communicating with members of one's own group is important for good communication skills. Additionally, the question specifically asks what members of a religion have in common. The most central and defining characteristic of a religion is belief in a higher power or deity, usually referred to as God. Therefore, the answer is likely "believe in god." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or the characteristics of religion.
The sentence suggests that you can get chicken without leaving your car, which is a common feature of fast food restaurants with drive-thru windows. "BBQ" and "pizza" may also be available at some fast food restaurants, but the sentence specifically refers to chicken. "Plate" is not a location where you can get food, and "eaten" does not make sense in the context of the question.
The context suggests that the sentence is talking about a child's ability to create pretend scenarios and engage in imaginative play. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to imagination or the ability to imagine. Creativity and free imagination are related concepts, but not necessarily the best choice because they could be interpreted as overlapping with the idea of imagining. Acting skills and thinking skills are not directly related to the concept of pretending or imaginative play.
The sentence suggests that the door to door salesman was looking for the homeowner and asked for them directly. The fact that the man didn't do something implies that the door to door salesman needed to communicate with the homeowner and was unsuccessful in doing so. Answering a telephone call would be the most likely way for the homeowner to communicate with the salesman, while the other options do not make as much sense in the given context.
The adverb "lustfully" suggests that the person's gaze was driven by desire, and the fact that the object of the gaze was the person's girlfriend suggests a romantic or sexual attraction. The phrase "looked into his girlfriend's eyes" can imply intimacy, and the use of the verb "express" in the last option reinforces the idea that the person wanted to communicate their feelings to their partner. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the cheese needs to be left in the cellar for a few years, which suggests that the cheese needs time to mature or age in order to improve its flavor. The option "age well" is also a good choice as it conveys the same idea. The other options do not explain why the cheese needs to be stored in the cellar for a few years.
The sentence mentions a water spout that would not turn off, which implies that there was excess water filling up a container. The only option that refers to a container or receptacle that can hold water is the sink, which is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "hard time seeing ahead due to darkness" suggests that the answer must refer to a location where it is difficult to see because of poor lighting. Of the given options, only a subway can fit this description. The other answers - lead orchestra, orchestra, lead play, and opera - do not have any clear connection to poor lighting or darkness.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to live in a specific type of house, which is a brick row house. Row houses are commonly found in older cities like London, which is located in England. The word "foggy" further supports this idea, as London is famous for its foggy weather. The other options, such as city center, cheap living, ghetto, and jars, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that families have a lot of boxes to store, and the location mentioned is where they tend to keep them. The options "mail," "shoe store," and "warehouse" do not fit this context, as they are not typically places where families store their possessions. "Cellar" is a possible option, but "basement" is a more common term used for the storage area underneath a house.
The sentence suggests that the wage gap being discussed is between two groups, one of which is the rich, and the other of which is likely to be characterized as having limited financial resources. The word "poor" is the only answer choice that fits this description, and is therefore the correct choice. The other options either have no clear connection to the context of the sentence or describe a state that is not related to financial status.
The word "bus" refers to a form of public transportation that is commonly found in urban areas, such as cities. It is unlikely to use a bus to travel to or within a state like Michigan, where driving or taking a train may be more common. The other options, like a computer or ocean, are not related to transportation.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to clean a cup after drinking out of it. While all the choices could potentially be used to clean a cup, the most efficient and effective method is likely to use a dishwasher, which is an appliance specifically designed for cleaning dishes and utensils. The other options do not have any clear connection to cleaning or dishwashing.
The sentence implies that the rich young people were looking for something exciting and possibly adventurous to do before starting their careers. This could be achieved through travel, which allows for new experiences and exploration. The other options, such as playing games or sleeping, do not necessarily provide the same level of excitement and adventure that travel does.
The sentence suggests that smacking an animal while riding a horse is unethical and may result in legal consequences. In many jurisdictions, animal cruelty is a punishable offense, and smacking an animal could be considered abusive or neglectful behavior. The other options do not address the ethical or legal implications of the action described in the sentence.
Sunlight typically enters a house through its windows, making the windowsill the most likely answer. The other options (like sea, disneyland or street) do not seem to be related to sunlight entering a house. While curtains can impact the amount of sunlight that enters a room, they are not where the sunlight initially enters.
The sentence indicates that the person is going to watch something in a theater, and doesn't want to get up once they take their seat. This implies that they will be sitting for a while, which is typical behavior when watching a show or movie in a theater setting. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the painter struggled to create a perfect portrait, which implies that he perceived the subjects he painted as imperfect in some way. The word "imperfect" describes a subject that has flaws or is not ideal, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options (disfigured, damaged, flawed, defective) all have negative connotations that don't fit the context of the sentence as well, as they suggest a more severe or specific imperfection.
The sentence indicates that James is driving quickly and is also late. Typically, if someone is driving faster than the speed limit, they are at a risk of getting a speeding ticket, which is a form of fine or penalty imposed for excessive speed while driving. The other options, such as boredom or diabetes, are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this scenario.
Birds are known for using their wings to fly, while their legs are used for walking or perching. Feathers are used for insulation and aerodynamics during flight, but they do not directly enable the bird to take flight. Similarly, entertaining oneself and moving one's head have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the protagonist made a conscious decision to plant a specific type of plant in a designated location, which would likely be a garden. The use of the word "row" also suggests that the location is long and narrow, which is a common layout for vegetable gardens. The other options do not fit the context of a gardening activity.
The sentence mentions the man descending from a mountainous area and into a marsh, which can only be found in certain regions. Louisiana and Florida are both states that contain marshes, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine which state the man is in. The specific term "Everglades" refers to a unique marsh area in southern Florida, which is the most likely answer given the context of the sentence. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context.
The sentence suggests that the children had been using television for a prolonged period of time on Saturday morning, and their parents wanted them to go outside and play to prevent them from experiencing a negative outcome. The word "suffered" indicates that something negative could happen if the children continued to use television. Out of the given choices, "boredom" is the most likely outcome of not engaging in physical activity or social interaction outside. "Visual" and "eye strain" could be potential issues related to excessive screen time, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "boredom." "Entertained" and "laziness boredom" are not accurate options based on the information provided.
The sentence indicates that while the culture was peaceful overall, there were still competitive events that involved men fighting. This suggests that the culture valued physical prowess and competition, but did not necessarily believe in violence outside of a competitive setting. The other options all relate to violence or aggression in some way, but do not fit the context of a peaceful culture with competitive events.
The sentence suggests that Louisiana was part of a particular region during a historical period, which would narrow down the possible choices. The term "Confederate state" refers specifically to states that seceded from the United States during the Civil War, which occurred in the mid-19th century. The phrase "deep south" is commonly used to refer to the southernmost region of the United States, which includes Louisiana and other states that were part of the Confederacy. The other options are either too general (United States) or unrelated to the context of the sentence (98 of world's crayfish, revolutionary war).
The sentence is asking for a characteristic that is common in accidents but not in weddings. Accidents often happen suddenly and unexpectedly, while weddings are planned well in advance and have a set schedule. The other options may apply to both accidents and weddings, such as happening to people or hurting people.
Crabs are typically found in coastal areas and are known to scavenge for food on tidal flats, which are areas of shore that are exposed during low tide. The other options, such as fish market or Chinese market, may have food that a crab would enjoy, but they do not specifically pertain to where a crab is likely to find and eat its food. Delicious meal and crabcakes also do not provide any clear indication of a specific location where a crab would enjoy its food.
The use of the word "specialized" suggests that the medical consultation being sought is not a routine service and may require expertise that is not commonly available in all areas. Major cities are typically centers of advanced medical practices and research, making them a likely destination for those seeking specialized medical consultation. The other options do not necessarily have a reputation for advanced medical care or access to specialized practitioners.
The phrase "wealth of knowledge" indicates that the person or group being referred to has a large amount of information at their disposal. This is a common association with universities, which are institutions dedicated to higher education and research. The other options may have some connection to knowledge or information, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as a university would.
The sentence suggests that animals share some of the same health issues as humans, and specifically mentions cancer as an example. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is "die of cancer." The other options either do not relate to health issues or are not necessarily common occurrences for pets.
Science involves experiments and working with materials that can be dangerous if not handled correctly. One must be careful to avoid accidents and take necessary precautions when learning about science. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where someone can purchase clothing and makeup, as well as have a meal. A shopping mall is a common location where clothing stores, makeup stores, and restaurants can be found in close proximity to each other, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about how people physically view the sky, which is done by looking up. The other options may provide additional information about the sky, but do not directly answer the question. "Place on earth" and "atmosphere" refer to the location and composition of the sky, while "photo" and "beautiful" assume that the person is not physically present to see the sky.
The context of the sentence implies that there is a stage that is elevated, which suggests that the only logical option is to climb stairs to reach the stage. Having talent or teaching have no relation to the physical act of accessing an elevated stage, while crawling would not be appropriate for someone who needs to go on stage. In play is also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The term "staple" usually refers to something that is regularly used or relied upon in a particular context. In the context of the manufacturing industry, machinery is a common and essential component that is used in almost every aspect of the production process. Therefore, it is more likely to be the correct option compared to the other choices, which do not have a direct connection to the manufacturing industry.
When receiving a new credit card, it is typically mailed to the recipient in a protective envelope for security purposes. A wallet or purse is where one might store the card once it is received, but they are not typically used for delivery. A restaurant does not have any relevance to receiving a credit card.
The clue in the sentence is "watching some car drive in circles," which suggests that the activity they are going to watch is a car race. The most likely location for a car race is a race track, which is also one of the options in the answer choices. The other options are locations or words that do not have any clear connection to car racing, so they can be eliminated.
The sentence suggests that the spirit in question is witnessing other similar beings wandering without a clear goal or purpose, which is a common trope in ghost stories. The options that are most closely related to this context are the haunted saloon and the haunted house. However, the mention of other similar beings points more strongly towards the haunted house, as this is a more common setting for the appearance of multiple ghosts or spirits. The other options do not fit as well with the context provided.
The sentence suggests that the couple is trying to find a new match for the old wall color, which implies that they are looking for a place that sells paint. The most logical option would be a paint store, which is likely to have a wide variety of colors for them to choose from. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Sloths are known to be arboreal animals that primarily inhabit trees in tropical environments. Tropical jungles are known for their dense vegetation and diverse wildlife, making it an ideal habitat for a variety of animals, including sloths. The other options, such as basement and universe, are not realistic habitats for sloths, while Amazonia and forest are too broad and do not provide enough specific information to choose as the answer.
The sentence suggests that the monkey had classified documents, which means they were most likely stolen from a government organization. The mention of La Defense also implies a location in France, which supports the idea that the French government was chasing the monkey to retrieve the documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about rare consequences of snoring, so the answer is unlikely to be something commonly associated with snoring such as complaining or an upset partner. Snoring can cause disturbed sleep and loud noise, but these are not rare consequences. However, in rare cases, snoring can be a symptom of a more serious condition such as sleep apnea, which can cause death if left untreated.
The sentence mentions the shark navigating from the African coast to New York, which suggests that it was traveling across a large body of water. The options "bathtub" and "sea world" are unrealistic as they do not provide enough space for a shark to navigate through. "Seawater" and "saltwater" are properties of the ocean, but do not provide information about the location. "Atlantic ocean" is the most relevant option as it is a large body of water that connects Africa to the United States, which matches the context of the sentence.
The phrase "planned skyscraper" suggests that construction of a tall building is in progress. The word "excavation" implies that some work is being done at the site to prepare for construction. The only option that refers to a location where construction work is typically carried out is "construction site." The other options - cemetery, mountain, desert, and archeological site - do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not typically associated with building construction.
Summer is typically associated with hot weather, so if someone is thinking about getting wet during this season, it is likely because they want to cool off. Swimming, water parks, and other water-related activities are popular ways to beat the heat in the summer. The other options, such as shrinking or getting cold, do not make sense in the context of summer and getting wet.
The question implies that the person already bought the apple, so it is likely that they have it with them. The option "in your grocery bag" suggests that the apple is already in a bag, which is a common way to carry groceries when leaving a store. The other options, such as greengrocer and grocery store, do not make sense as the person has already made the purchase. The options fridge and refrigerator suggest that the apple has already been stored, but this is not indicated in the question.
The act of cleaning is typically associated with creating a clean and organized space, which is commonly referred to as neatness. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of cleaning, as exhaustion may be a result of cleaning but is not necessarily a characteristic of the outcome, sneezing is not related to cleaning, order may be a result of cleaning but is not specific to cleaning, and clutter is the opposite of the desired outcome of cleaning.
The sentence indicates that Sarah did not want to hurt James's feelings, so it is unlikely that she would have directly pointed out the similarity between his story and others'. Instead, she might have listened politely and given him the impression that she found his story engaging or interesting, without actually engaging with the content itself. The other options for the answer are all related to copying or reproducing the story, which is not what Sarah did in this situation.
The sentence states that a cat cannot talk, but then suggests that a cat can do something else. One option that cats are well-known for is meowing, which is a sound they use to communicate with humans and other cats. Meowing is a distinctive characteristic of cats and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, while true for cats, do not specifically relate to the sentence's context, making them incorrect answers.
The sentence suggests that remembering things is a characteristic associated with a certain trait. Intelligence is commonly associated with the ability to remember things because it involves having a sharp mind and quick thinking. Neuronal network and memories are more specific and do not have a direct correlation to the sentence. Recall and learning about are more focused on the process of remembering rather than the trait itself.
The sentence mentions that James worked at a Kosher Deli in a Jewish neighborhood in the same city where his grandparents came over from Europe in the 40s. The options of Jerusalem and Miami are not mentioned in the context and therefore cannot be the correct answer. The option of food court is not relevant to the context and does not make sense as a place to live. The option of town is too vague and could refer to any number of places. New York City is the only option mentioned in the context and makes sense as a place where there could be a Jewish neighborhood and a view of the Statue of Liberty.
The fact that he forgot his socks implies that he had already put his shoes on before realizing his mistake. Therefore, it makes sense that he would double check his shoes to make sure he didn't forget anything else. The other options, such as bed and suitcase, do not relate to his immediate need in getting ready to leave. Pockets are a possibility, but the sentence implies that he needed to double check something outside of his immediate person. The sporting goods store does not make sense as an option at all.
The sentence suggests that there is a specific location where the courthouse of any given town in America is typically located. Since courthouses are typically considered central institutions in any town or city, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is the "center of town." The other options, such as an "electrical circuit," "getting married," "capital city," and "Michigan" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the football fans were trying to purchase tickets, which would typically be sold at a venue that hosts sports events. This description matches the option "sports arena," which is a place specifically designed for sports events and ticket sales. The other options, such as a movie theatre, clerk, or metro station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A wheel is a common part of a vehicle, so it is likely that it would be produced in a place that specializes in vehicle parts. An auto parts store specifically deals with the sale of parts and supplies for vehicles, so it would be a logical place for wheels to be produced. The other options do not have any clear connection to the manufacturing or distribution of vehicle parts.
The question implies that after a long day, one wants to unwind and have fun. Out of the given choices, snuggling and kissing are more intimate activities that may not be applicable to all individuals. Effort and activity suggest doing something that requires exertion, which is not necessarily relaxing. Therefore, the correct answer would be relaxing, which aligns with the idea of unwinding and having fun after a tiring day.
Valleys are typically formed by the erosion or shifting of larger landforms such as mountains or hills. Therefore, it is more likely that a valley would be situated in a mountainous region rather than in a hilly area or a continent. West Virginia may have some mountainous regions, but it is not a general characteristic of the entire state. A peak, on the other hand, refers to the highest point of a mountain and is not usually associated with valleys.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to entertainment, and that money needs to be spent at a ticket booth before entering the building. "Venue" is the only option that fits this context, as it refers to a place where events or performances are held and where tickets are typically sold. The other options may require payment, but they do not necessarily involve a ticket booth or entertainment.
The context suggests that the consequence of being too worn out before going to the opera is related to fatigue, which typically leads to feeling sleepy or nodding off during the performance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When visiting a museum, children are likely to experience wonder and amazement at the various exhibits and artifacts on display. Museums are designed to be educational and engaging, so it is common for children to be fascinated by what they see. Crowding and sore feet may be unpleasant experiences in a museum environment, but they are not necessarily specific to children. Being bored and fearful may also occur, but wonder is the most likely and positive experience for a child visiting a museum.
The word "innocent" implies that the person did not commit the crime they were accused of, but the question is asking about how they felt after being accused. It is common for people to feel guilty even if they are innocent when they are accused of a crime because they may feel responsible for not preventing the situation or for being perceived in a negative light. The other options, such as "fear" or "great sorrow," may also be possible emotions, but the word "guilty" best fits the context of the question.
The question is asking about how to learn the anatomy of a blowfish, which suggests that it may be a topic covered in educational resources such as books. While it is possible to observe a blowfish in its natural habitat in the Atlantic Ocean or at a fish market, these options do not necessarily guarantee a thorough understanding of its anatomy. France and sushi restaurants are not relevant to the context of the question. Therefore, books would be the best option for gaining knowledge about the anatomy of a blowfish.
While apple trees can grow in many locations, they typically require adequate water to thrive. Planting them near a water source, such as a creek or pond, can ensure that they receive enough moisture to produce fruit. Bloom, sunshine, and Washington State and New Hampshire are not directly related to the growth of apple trees.
The sentence suggests that the person has bought a bowl and is looking to store it somewhere, which would suggest a place to keep dishes or kitchenware. The options "restaurant" and "grave yard" do not make sense in this context, while "apartment" and "refrigerator" are more general and do not specifically relate to where one would store dishes. "Cupboard" is the most logical choice as it is a common place in a home to store dishes and kitchenware.
Mirrors on the ceiling are often associated with bars or nightclubs, where they are used to create a certain ambiance or to enhance the décor. While it's possible for a hotel or bedroom to have mirrors on the ceiling, it's much less common and not generally associated with those settings. Dressing rooms typically have mirrors on the walls or standing mirrors, and while it's possible for a car to have a mirror on the ceiling, it's not common or practical.
Excavation refers to the process of digging or removing earth materials from a site. In construction or mining, an excavation is typically done to create a work area where construction or mining can take place. Montana is a state and doesn't make sense in the context of the question. A city may be built on top of an excavation site but the question is asking about what is created after excavation is finished. A quarry is a place where large amounts of stone or other materials are extracted, but it doesn't necessarily refer to what is created after the excavation is finished. A truck is a vehicle used to transport materials but it is not an outcome of excavation. Therefore, the only logical answer is work area.
City halls are usually located in urban areas, which are defined as densely populated areas with a high amount of economic and social activity. City halls serve as administrative centers for cities and are often located in the downtown area or other central locations. The other options, such as "town" or "rooms," do not accurately describe the location of a city hall.
The sentence suggests that while we all are destined to die eventually, there is something else that we typically do. The phrase "even though we usually" indicates that the action is something that is common or expected. The option "wish we could" makes the most sense in this context, as it is a common sentiment that people express when facing the inevitability of death. Seeking help, writing a will, and going to hell are all specific actions that may be taken in response to impending death, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "wish we could." The option "never want" suggests that people do not want to die, which is not true for everyone, and it does not capture the nuance of the sentence.
The phrase "undisclosed time" suggests that the person does not know when the arrival will happen. Therefore, the only logical choice would be to wait patiently. Washing dishes and standing erect are unrelated to the context of waiting for an arrival. Crossing the street is also unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not involve waiting. Waiting room could be a possible answer, but it is less specific and may not be the best fit depending on the context.
The sentence implies that Akron is located within a certain state and that state must have at least one dance club. Ohio is the correct answer as Akron is a city located in Ohio. The other options are either incorrect (such as Michigan, Texas) or too general (such as United States, downtown area) to accurately apply to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the activity of taking a bath typically occurs inside a specific type of structure. The options "room that is upstairs," "hotel room," and "found in house" are too vague and do not suggest a clear structure type. "Own home" is similar to "house," but could refer to other living arrangements like apartments. "House" is the most accurate answer, as it specifically refers to a type of building where people typically live and have a bathroom for bathing.
The sentence implies that John was able to identify that the snake he encountered was not real based on his knowledge of where anacondas can be found. Anacondas are typically found in tropical regions such as South America, which is likely why John knew that it was unlikely to find one in the Midwest. The other options do not provide any relevant information about anacondas or their habitat.
The sentence suggests that the hobbit was facing a challenge or danger, which required him to possess a certain quality to be able to succeed. The word "timid" implies that he may have lacked courage or confidence initially, but to get the gold, he would need to be bold and fearless, hence the correct answer is "dauntless". The other answer choices have negative connotations, such as being mean or reckless, which are unlikely to be desirable traits in this context.
The term "gentleman" suggests a person who is refined and has a certain level of sophistication. Watching a game could refer to watching a sports match or competition, which is an activity that is often associated with leisure and entertainment. The other options (Europe, movie, university, suit) do not necessarily have a strong connection to an activity that a refined person may be watching.
The question asks what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be. The word "assistance" implies that the helper is providing support or aid to the person being helped. The word "prepared" fits this context, as someone who gives assistance could help another person to be prepared for a task or situation. The other answer choices are either synonyms or related to the concept of assistance, but they do not directly answer the question of what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be.
The sentence suggests that mummies do not undergo the same process as most other living things after death. Decomposition is a common process that occurs when a living thing dies, but it is unlikely to occur in mummies because they are preserved through various methods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the ship was taking in water, which is a clear sign that it may sink. Glass, fly, ocean, and surface of earth are not connected to the context of the sentence and are therefore not logical choices for the answer.
The sentence suggests that the side chair and lawn chair were located near each other, with the lawn chair being exposed to moisture or rain while the side chair was kept dry. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that if your hands are wet while bathing, you may not be able to do certain tasks. Using soap would be difficult but not impossible with wet hands. Dry skin is a consequence of not using moisturizer after a bath, which is unrelated to having wet hands during bathing. Slip and fall could happen due to wet feet, not necessarily due to wet hands. Reading a newspaper may be difficult due to its size, but reading a book can become impossible as the pages may get wet and difficult to turn.
The sentence suggests that the person needs medicine to alleviate their pain. The options "hospital" and "bathroom" are unlikely to provide the necessary medication. The options "jar" and "mug" do not make sense in this context. The most likely option is either a pharmacy, where medications can be purchased, or a medicine cabinet, where medications are stored.
The sentence suggests that James likes being around people, but there is something that he doesn't like that may arise from socializing. The word "conflicts" is the only option that fits the context of socializing with others but can lead to negative experiences. The other options, such as having fun, jealousy, love, and friendships, do not necessarily imply negative experiences or conflicts.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing a secret ingredient in a food item being eaten at the table, specifically noodles. As the other options do not involve food or cooking, it can be deduced that the correct answer must be related to food. Additionally, the mention of "wine" as the secret ingredient could indicate that the correct answer involves a savory or Italian cuisine, suggesting that "spaghetti sauce" is the most logical choice.
Out of all the choices, only "market" is a place where one can reasonably expect to find a variety of different cheeses for sale. "The moon" is obviously not a practical option, "fridge" and "refrigerator" are household appliances rather than locations, and "pizza" is a food item that may or may not happen to have cheese on it. Therefore, the correct answer is "market" as it is the only option that aligns with the question asked.
The sentence suggests that Loraine does not get a buzz or any positive feelings from drinking alcohol. In fact, the opposite may be true, as the sentence implies that drinking causes a negative reaction in Loraine. Based on this information, it is likely that Loraine experiences some form of sickness or discomfort when drinking alcohol. Intoxication and getting laid are not necessarily negative experiences and are not related to Loraine's lack of enjoyment of alcohol. Toxicity is possible, but sickness is a more common and general term that can encompass a variety of negative physical reactions to alcohol. Nausea is also a potential symptom of Loraine's negative reaction to drinking.
The word "launched" suggests that the ball was thrown or propelled forward, and it is logical that it would be in motion after being launched. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A catapult is a device used to launch objects, but the sentence suggests that the ball has already been launched. A flintlock is a type of firearm, which does not fit with the description of a projectile ball. Arcade and tennis court are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was in a sad and concerning state, indicating that the subject cares deeply about this person's well-being. The phrase "it was who she most" implies that the person in question is particularly important to her, emphasizing the emotional connection. The other options do not fit the emotional tone of the sentence or make logical sense in the context provided.
When playing basketball for a long period of time, the physical exertion is likely to cause sweat, which can cover one's shirt. "Make baskets" and "dribbling" are actions related to playing basketball, but do not have any connection to clothing. "Fall down" is a possible result of playing basketball, but does not refer to anything specific happening to one's shirt. "Work together" is also not related to the physical aspect of playing basketball.
The context of the question suggests that a divider is being used in a professional setting to create individual workspaces. An office suite is a common term used to describe a group of offices or workspaces used by one company or organization, whereas the other options do not necessarily have a connection to using dividers to create cubicles in a workspace.
The word "cogitating" means that Billy is thinking deeply or pondering something. The sentence suggests that he will eventually have to make a decision about the situation he is thinking about. The option "enlightenment" may be a possible choice but it is not consistent with the idea of coming to a decision. "New thoughts" and "headaches" are not logical choices, and "annurism" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a location in southeast Michigan where the person can find authentic barbecue, which is a type of food commonly associated with Southern American cuisine. While the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, Detroit is a major city in Michigan and is known for having several restaurants that serve Southern-style barbecue. Therefore, it is the most likely location for the person to find authentic barbecue while visiting southeast Michigan.
The sentence suggests that the drugged college kid was feeling lost or empty, and the word "void" is often used to describe this feeling. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too extreme (nightmare, coma, death) or unrelated (swamplife).
The word "park" suggests that this question is asking about where to park a car, not where to find a car. The word "outside" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as car parks are typically located outside of buildings or in designated parking areas on the sides of streets. The other options may have parking areas, but they do not make sense in the context of the question.
Pillowcases are typically associated with sleeping and bedding, which is usually found in a bedroom. While a linen closet or cupboard may contain extra bedding, it is less likely to have a spare pillowcase readily available than the bedroom. The bathroom is also unlikely to have a spare pillowcase unless it is being used as a temporary storage solution.
The question is asking where you could see a bone, and all of the choices given are places or things that could have bones. A museum might have bones on display as part of an exhibit, vertebrates are animals that have a backbone and therefore have bones, cows have bones like any other animal, Texas is a location where you might find fossils or other remains with bones, and an arm is a body part that contains bones. Therefore, the correct answer is that you could see a bone in any of these options.
The word "spirits" in this context is most likely referring to ghosts or supernatural entities. A haunted house is a common setting for such spirits to be found. The other options do not relate to the context of the question - human beings are not spirits, cemeteries are the resting places of deceased humans rather than places where spirits commonly reside, mediums are people who can communicate with spirits but not the spirits themselves, and a liquor cabinet has no connection to spirits in a paranormal sense.
The sentence suggests that if you are late getting to work, you will experience a negative feeling or emotion. The other options, such as promotions and malaise, do not make sense in the context of being late for work. Bad mood and upset are possible options, but stress is the most common and well-known emotion associated with being late for work. Stress is a feeling of pressure or tension that can result from being behind schedule or missing deadlines.
The context of the question suggests that the focus is on the proper disposal of old newspapers. Recycling is a common and environmentally friendly way to dispose of paper products such as newspapers. The other options aren't related to the proper disposal of old newspapers - "written on paper" refers to the medium used for writing, "informative but often biased" is a description of the content of newspapers, "delivered" refers to the means by which newspapers are distributed, and "printed on paper" is a description of the physical nature of newspapers, but doesn't suggest any particular method of disposal.
The mention of marble fountains and the high number seen in a single day suggest that the person was likely in a location with a significant number of historic or artistic fountains. Rome is known for its many beautiful fountains, including the Trevi Fountain, the Fountain of Four Rivers, and the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the game involves turns, which suggests that it is some sort of strategy or combat game. The first player attacks, which means that the second player must defend against the attack. Block and defend are similar in meaning, but block may imply a more active action, while defend is more passive. Surrender, retreat, and cease fire all suggest ending the game or giving up, which is not consistent with the context of taking turns and attacking/defending.
Both animals and humans have a skeletal structure made up of bones. Tails, horns, and fur coats are characteristics that not all animals share with humans, and the term "bodies" is too general to be a definitive answer.
The question asks for the country of origin of a fox, which suggests that the fox is a native species of that country. England is a known habitat for foxes, and is often associated with fox hunting and other fox-related activities. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the origin of foxes.
The word "product" suggests that something is being displayed or marketed, and the option "demonstration" is commonly used in this context to refer to showcasing the features or benefits of a product. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the display or promotion of a product on a table.
The sentence suggests that the soldiers entered a building to find safety while on the run and in danger. To ensure their safety, they would have to make sure that the building is secure, meaning that it is protected from outside threats and is not easily accessible. The other options do not reflect the need for safety and security in this context.
The sentence suggests that the trees formed a forest, which is usually defined as a large area covered with trees. Since the trees are mentioned collectively as forming a forest, it is likely that they are standing together in a dense grouping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that loose credit cards are being thrown into a container of some sort, and the most likely container for loose credit cards for women would be their purse. Envelopes are usually used to send letters or documents, and are not typically used to store credit cards. While a help person may help someone track expenses, it is unlikely that credit cards would be thrown at them. A floor is not a container and would not be a logical place for storing credit cards. Wallets are typically used to store credit cards, but the context of the sentence suggests that the cards are loose and not organized in a wallet.
Squirrels are known for their ability to climb trees and it is common to see them nesting or gathering food in trees. Additionally, the word "brave" suggests that the squirrel might be taking some kind of risk or facing a challenge, which is more likely to happen in a natural environment like a forest or park than in a man-made setting like a street or yard.
The sentence indicates that the tennis court was the target of fraternity pranks, implying that it was located on a college campus where fraternities are present. The other options are not mentioned in the sentence and do not offer any clear connection to the context. Wimbledon, for instance, is a famous tennis tournament held in England, and it would not be a likely location for fraternity pranks.
The sentence suggests that having a small dog requires something specific, which is indicated by the use of "it is good to have." Out of the options given, only a basket seems relevant to having a small dog - it could be used for carrying the dog around, or as a comfortable place for the dog to sleep. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to having a small dog - a backyard or front yard may be nice for the dog to play in, but it does not specifically address the needs of a small dog. An own home or dog show may be desirable for other reasons, but are not relevant to the needs of a small dog.
The sentence implies that the news held a forum to discuss who people would choose for some kind of position or role, but that there was a group of individuals who had not yet made a decision. This group would be called "undecided." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "reject" suggests a negative decision, "predetermination" suggests a decision already made, "force" is not related to decision-making, and "blank" is not commonly used to refer to people who have not made a choice.
A shoebox is a container specifically designed to hold shoes, so it would be the most logical answer to the question. Keeping a shoe on your left foot or at a wedding are not relevant to the question. While a shoe could be kept in a closet or a house, those answers are too broad and do not specify a specific location within those spaces.
This question is asking for the logical sequence of putting something on your foot. The most common item to put on your foot first before anything else is a sock, followed by a shoe. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Fungus is a type of infection that does not belong on your foot, and grave and table are not items that you would put on your foot.
The sentence suggests that the discovery of horses by Native Americans had an impact on the plains landscape. The word "dominated" indicates that the Native Americans may have become more influential and powerful in their environment after acquiring horses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Seeing the finish line in a race can often trigger an adrenaline rush, which is a surge of energy and excitement that can help the athlete push through and finish strong. This is a common experience for many athletes and is likely why the option "adrenaline rush" is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence highlights that the factory produces specialized toys such as AK47's and MiGs, which are associated with the Russian military. This suggests that the factory is located in or associated with Russia, making "Russia" the correct answer. The other options, such as free trade zones, industrial park, napoleon, and workers, do not provide any context or connection to the mention of specialized Russian military toys.
The sentence indicates that farmers will plant an apple tree for a specific purpose. The option "produce fruit" is the most viable choice as apple trees are a known source of fruit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "steak house" typically refers to a restaurant that specializes in serving steak, which is a type of meat often associated with high-end dining. However, strip malls are known for having a variety of small storefronts that cater to a wide range of consumer needs, often including fast food and casual dining options. Therefore, it is unlikely that a strip mall would have more than one steak house, as it would not necessarily be the ideal location for this type of fine dining establishment to succeed. The other options are all locations where one might reasonably expect to find multiple steak houses, depending on the size of the city or the preferences of the local population.
The word "urgent" suggests that the wound requires immediate attention, which is typically provided in an emergency room. A hospital or injured person could refer to a variety of medical situations, not just urgent wounds. "Hurt" is a vague term that does not provide any specific information about where to go for medical attention. "Battle" is not a medical location, but rather a description of a specific type of conflict.
Mines and explosions are often associated with countries that have experienced or are still experiencing armed conflict, as landmines are frequently used as weapons. Cambodia is a country that has a history of conflict, including civil wars and the Cambodian genocide, which has resulted in a large number of unexploded landmines across the country. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Frogs are known to move on land by hopping, which involves pushing off the ground with their back legs and landing on their front legs. Jumping several feet is unlikely since frogs are not capable of sustained flight. Swimming is how frogs move through water, not on land. Leaping is similar to jumping and also unlikely for a short distance. Walking is not a typical form of movement for frogs as their legs are adapted for jumping and hopping in water and on land.
The sentence implies that the person achieved a positive outcome and was recognized by their peers in response. The word "congratulated" suggests that they were praised or acknowledged for their achievement, which is a common response to success. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not relate to achievement or imply a negative reaction from others.
The sentence suggests that there is an issue with the chain on Bill's bike, which is likely affecting the function of the bike. The gear shift is a crucial part of the bike that allows the rider to change gears and adjust their speed. If the chain keeps coming off, it's likely that the gear shift is not able to function properly, which would make it difficult to use. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Admissions counselors are responsible for evaluating students' readiness for school based on a variety of factors, including age. Therefore, the answer is likely to be "old enough" as it pertains to the age requirements for starting school. The other options do not necessarily relate to the admissions process or age requirements for starting school.
The sentence implies that the speaker has successfully made a good loaf of bread, and the only thing left to do is to consume it. The other options are not relevant in this context.
The sentence implies that the person is preparing to leave for work, so "get ready" is the most appropriate choice. "Wake up" is too general and could refer to any time of day, "have job" is not an action someone does before leaving for work, "message the boss" is not a common task before leaving for work, and "take bus" may not apply to everyone, as some people might drive or walk to work.
The sentence suggests that the person dislikes visiting museums because of the stillness and the requirement of looking at things. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. Taking pictures, appreciation, crying or whispering do not necessarily require stillness, and may not be directly related to visiting museums.
The Atlantic Ocean is located on the western side of the globe, so the correct choice will likely relate to the western hemisphere in some way. The other choices do not necessarily suggest a connection to the Atlantic Ocean.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to learn something about someone they are talking to. "Getting acquainted" refers to the process of becoming familiar with someone and learning about their background, interests, and personality. The other options are related to communication in general, but do not specifically refer to the act of learning about someone during a conversation.
The sentence suggests that the person is having fun by doing a lot of planned activities, which is often associated with feeling happy and fulfilled. The other options do not accurately describe the context of the sentence. "Do like" and "do enjoy" are not commonly used phrases in English, "spontaneous" suggests the person is not planning activities, and "work less" is not related to the context of fun and planned activities.
The question is asking for a reason why someone may believe that killing is justified. The option "punishment" aligns with the concept of capital punishment or the death penalty, which is sometimes argued as a justifiable form of punishment for certain crimes. The other options are not in line with the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James committed a serious crime (stabbing someone to death) and will likely face legal consequences as a result. Given the severity of the crime, "jail time" is the most likely outcome. The other options do not provide a logical consequence of committing such a serious offence.
The sentence implies that having a dry, clean floor is particularly crucial in one specific type of building. Restaurants are places where food is prepared and served, and any spills or wetness on the floor can pose a safety hazard for both employees and customers. In contrast, places like beds, synagogues, and weddings do not necessarily have the same level of risk associated with a wet or dirty floor. The option "all buildings" is too broad and generalizes the sentence's meaning.
The sentence suggests that John needed to escape from something he was afraid of being caught by. The words "escape" and "scared" imply that there is some danger or threat he is trying to avoid. The use of the word "runt" may suggest that he is physically small or weak, which could make him more vulnerable to being caught. The other options also suggest some form of confinement or restriction, but they do not specifically imply that John is afraid of being caught.
James loves climbing, which suggests he enjoys the physical and mental challenge of ascending a height. The word "exhilaration" means excitement and pleasure, which is a common feeling associated with climbing and experiencing heights. The other options are less likely to be associated with positive emotions related to climbing. Exhaustion and falling down are negative outcomes that James would likely want to avoid, nervousness is a feeling of anxiety, and vertigo is a feeling of dizziness or disorientation.
The word "drill" is commonly associated with dental procedures such as drilling a cavity or preparing a tooth for a filling or crown. These procedures are typically performed by a dentist in a dental office, not in a garage, army, basement, or repair shop. Therefore, the correct answer is "dentist office."
The sentence suggests that if you become an undercover shopper, your main goal is to perform a review of products you purchase. Getting paid for the review is a common practice in this field, so it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer is "get money." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is using a trash can in the downtown district of a city, which implies that they may be in a densely populated area with buildings and businesses. When in the downtown district of a city, alleys are often used as service entrances for businesses and are commonly lined with dumpsters and trash cans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the archaeologist was driven by a desire for knowledge or understanding, which is commonly associated with the pursuit of truth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Billy needs rest, which suggests that he's tired or stressed. The phrase "wanted to have rest" indicates that he wants to take a break and unwind. The option "relax" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly relates to the idea of taking a break and resting. The other options are either too specific or don't match the context of the sentence.
A cube is a three-dimensional shape that has six faces, all of which are squares. It has eight corners, also called vertices, which are formed by the intersection of three edges. The sentence specifically mentions "top, bottom, and two sides," which leaves only one possibility for the missing component: a corner. The other options do not fit the characteristics of a cube.
The word "authoritative" implies a sense of power or control. Standing erect, or standing tall with good posture, is often associated with confidence and assertiveness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of appearing authoritative.
The phrase "make a pig of myself" suggests overeating or indulging in an excessive amount of food. Therefore, the most likely outcome would be a full stomach. The other options, such as gaining energy or feeling satisfied, do not align with the context of overindulging. Dieting, on the other hand, is the opposite of overeating and would therefore not be the correct answer.
The question is asking for something that "every human wants with someone else," implying a positive and intimate connection between individuals. A healthy relationship fits this criteria and is a common desire among humans. The other options do not align with the context of the question and do not describe a desired connection between individuals.
The sentence suggests that the weather was different from what was expected in the evening, which implies that the temperature changed during the day. The correct option would be the one that indicates a specific time of day when the temperature was not what was anticipated. The other options do not relate to the time of day, and the desert option may even suggest that the evening was still cold.
The context suggests that the question is asking about an activity related to darkness. The only option that makes sense in this context is "movie," since many movie theaters offer snacks including ice cream and the theater is typically darkened during the film. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the harp is commonly played at a specific type of establishment. This is likely to be an Irish bar, as the harp is an important symbol of Irish culture and is often associated with traditional Irish music. Other options, such as a music shop or auditorium, are not specifically linked to the harp and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
The question explicitly mentions fast food chains, which are commonly associated with the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to fast food chains. Additionally, visiting a county or a seaside does not necessarily guarantee an abundance of fast food options.
The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to someone they worked closely with during the dance competition. Praise for one's own moving abilities, happiness, or talent would not typically be phrased in this way, and sitting still is clearly not relevant to a dance competition. Therefore, it is most likely that the subject is praising their dance partner for their part in the victory.
The sentence implies that eating healthier and exercising are likely to have a positive effect on one's physical health. Weight loss is often a desired outcome of these activities as they can help to burn calories and reduce body fat. Tiredness and sweat may be temporary side effects of exercising, but they do not necessarily indicate a positive outcome. Diet is also important for overall health, but it alone may not result in weight loss without exercise.
The question implies that praying is possible even if someone is paralyzed, which means it does not require physical movement. Speaking to god is a common way of communicating with him during prayer, and this would not be impeded by paralysis. Going to church or kneeling both require physical movement, which would be difficult or impossible for someone who is paralyzed. Praise for god and sincere prayers are important components of prayer, but they do not specifically address the issue of paralysis.
The question suggests that the object is not commonly found in a common room, which implies that it may have personal significance or be specific to an individual's taste. The other options do not necessarily imply a personal connection, e.g. rare or elite could refer to an expensive or exclusive object that is not commonly found, but it does not necessarily imply a personal connection.
Mailboxes are typically found in front yards where people receive their mail. Porches may sometimes have a mailbox, but not typically in such large numbers. Hardware stores and diners are unlikely places to find mailboxes, and downtown areas may have a few mailboxes, but not to the extent of "hundreds of thousands."
A registry office typically deals with legal matters such as births, deaths, marriages and property. As such, it is likely that you would need to visit a court house, which is a government building where legal matters are handled, before entering a registry office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Helium, magnesium, and sulfur are commonly used elements in chemistry experiments and are likely to be found in a chemistry laboratory. The other options such as atmosphere and air are not specific to a school setting, while supply closet and laboratory are too general and could apply to any type of school or workplace.
The sentence specifies that James went into his office at "city hall," which is a public building used for government and administrative purposes. Skyscrapers and tall buildings can also be public buildings, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine if this is the case. "Work" and "a house" are too general and do not specify the type of building.
The question is asking where you would place a candle if you wanted it on a wall, suggesting that the candle needs to be in a position that is both secure and elevated. A shelf is a logical choice because it can hold the candle securely and is already attached to the wall, making it an easy and safe option. The other options (birthday cake, church, floor, and dark) do not make sense in the context of the question or would not provide a safe or practical location for a candle on a wall.
The question is asking for what a town is a subset of, and a city is a logical answer because cities are typically made up of smaller towns within their boundaries. Rural areas and countryside are more general terms that can encompass towns, cities, and other types of settlements. Train stations are specific locations within a town or city, but they do not define what a town is a part of. A state is a political boundary that a town may be located within, but it does not necessarily make up a part of a town.
The sentence suggests that a specific group of people came in to complete the flooring of the building. The term "tradesmen" generally refers to skilled workers who specialize in a particular trade or craft, such as flooring installation. The other options (builders, architect, target, tornado) do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the task of flooring installation.
The question asks specifically about the location of the Indian Ocean in relation to Africa. Looking at a map, we can see that the Indian Ocean is located on the eastern side of the African continent, with countries like Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique bordering it. The other choices do not provide any relevant information to help us determine the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the group's ability to communicate well contributed to the quality of their work. Collaboration is a key component of successful teamwork, and effective communication is essential for collaboration to work. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - progress and static might refer to the group's work output, coup might suggest a sudden achievement or success, and confusion implies a lack of communication or understanding.
The sentence suggests that the person is being asked what they will do if they don't turn and don't move. Of the given choices, standing still is the only action that fits this description. Twisting implies a change in direction, and going straight implies movement. Therefore, the correct answer is stand still.
The question is asking for a location where millions of apartments can be found. The option "town" is the most likely choice as it is common to find a large number of apartments in urban areas with high population density. Michigan is a state and is not specific enough to determine the location of millions of apartments. "Inside the house" is not a location where millions of apartments would be found. "Avoid buying" and "budget" are not locations at all, but rather suggestions or considerations when looking for apartments.
Both of these answers could be considered illegal actions that guns can do. If the question is asking about illegal actions that are directly related to the use of a gun, arming robbers would be the correct answer as it is a direct violation of weapons laws. However, if the question is more broad and includes the potential consequences of gun use, distracting police from a real crime could also be considered illegal since it obstructs justice. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the potential illegalities of gun use.
The question is asking for a term that applies to all living things that have at least one nerve. The term "organism" refers to any living thing, whether it's an animal, plant, or single-celled organism. The other options are not applicable to all living things as they refer to specific parts or features of the body, or a particular type of animal.
When people meet for the first time in a professional or formal setting, it is common to perform a handshake. This gesture indicates a mutual respect and sets the tone for a positive interaction. The other options may also occur during a meeting, but the sentence specifically mentions "meeting" which suggests a greeting or introduction is taking place, making the handshake the most likely option.
The question asks where one can look up a number to a business when there is no electricity. This suggests that the answer should not involve electronics or power, ruling out options like power grid and roulette wheel. An equation and math problem are not relevant to looking up phone numbers. A telephone book, however, is a printed directory of phone numbers, making it a reliable source of information when electricity is not available. Therefore, the correct answer is telephone book.
The sentence states that cats are mammals, and it is common knowledge that all mammals smell with their nose. The other options do not have any direct correlation to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that wrestling requires a certain level of physical strength. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "strong." Options such as "train yourself," "take lessons," and "choke hold" may relate to wrestling to some extent, but they don't clearly describe a trait that is commonly associated with people who wrestle. Similarly, while having strength may go hand in hand with wrestling, it doesn't necessarily imply that someone who wrestles is always very strong.
The sentence suggests that while Billy had intelligence, he lacked experience in certain areas. "Ignorant" means lacking knowledge or experience in a particular subject, so it would be the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "garish" means overly colorful or flashy, "bright" is a synonym of intelligent rather than inexperienced, "make invisible" is not related to Billy's situation, and "backward" suggests a lack of intelligence rather than a lack of experience.
In a barbershop, a razor is typically the most important tool a barber uses because it is what is used to actually cut the hair. While scissors are also important, they are typically used for more precise cuts and shaping rather than the initial cut. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not a tool used for cutting. The other options (commercial area and city) are completely unrelated to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that the man loved to fish for bass, which are a type of freshwater fish. This suggests that the man would prefer to fish in a freshwater environment. The other options, such as river or live in ponds, may also offer freshwater environments but are not specific to the type of fish the man loves to catch. Additionally, the sentence suggests that the man needs a boat and equipment, which are typically used in larger bodies of water such as lakes. The option of sunshine or music store does not have any clear connection to fishing.
The sentence suggests that the person is describing what makes a good movie and that they appreciate "little" things. This implies that they value attention to detail, which is important in creating a high-quality film. The other options, such as "mice," "go home," "witty," and "headache," do not make sense in the context of describing what makes a good movie.
The question is asking about who keeps their car in a parking area, which could refer to any group of individuals who own cars and need a place to park them. The other options are all specific locations where parking areas might be found, but they do not necessarily answer the question about who uses them.
The question is asking for a similarly powerful vessel but faster, which rules out options like patrol boats or yachts which are not designed for speed or strength. An aircraft carrier and a destroyer are both larger and more powerful than a battleship, with different functions and purposes. A corvette, on the other hand, is a smaller, swift military vessel designed for speed, agility, and firepower, making it a suitable option for someone looking for a faster alternative to a battleship.
The sentence suggests that the woman had a positive emotional reaction to the music. Given that the other options have negative connotations (silent, irritate) or don't clearly reflect an emotional response (express emotion, quiet mind), the correct answer is likely to be "beautiful," which is a word commonly used to describe music that is pleasing or enjoyable to listen to.
The sentence suggests that the toilet was built into a suit used by zero gravity travelers, which implies that the travelers were in space. The context of the sentence implies that this was a particular type of vehicle or mode of transportation, which makes the options of aircraft, stadium, and restaurant less likely choices. The word "toilet" also suggests a limited range of options, and the presence of "shuttle" in the phrase "space shuttle" makes it the most logical choice.
The other options in the list do not specifically indicate a problem with sleeping, whereas nightmares are commonly associated with disrupting sleep patterns. While being at a party or having fun might lead to a lack of sleep in some cases, these options are not specific enough to be the correct answer to this question. Death and relaxation may or may not have an impact on sleep, and would depend on the individual and their circumstances.
The sentence suggests that Sarah's wife wanted her to be more present and accessible, which is often conveyed through the term "available." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the family had a lot of love and affection for their pet dog, so it is likely that they would have given it a proper funeral or burial. The option "coffin" is the most appropriate choice for this, as it is a container used for laying a body to rest. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question had lived a fulfilling life and was content at the end, implying that they had accomplished their goals and were at peace with their life. The phrase "died with no regrets" further emphasizes this idea. The last thing that the person did was to take their last breath, indicated by the phrase "as he took his last." The other options - reading a book, going to school, or embarking on a journey - do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the person's contentment or the idea of dying with no regrets.
The sentence establishes that a continent is a large area of land, but then contrasts this with what the globe is mostly covered by. The most common answer to this would be an ocean, as oceans cover roughly 71% of the Earth's surface. The other options, while all related to geography in some way, do not make sense in this context - for example, Australia is a continent but not the answer we're looking for here.
The sentence suggests that having a home base when camping is important or beneficial. The word "base" implies a central location or starting point, and having a designated place to return to while camping can make the experience more comfortable and organized. The other options do not make sense in the context of camping or having a home base.
The sentence indicates that the fox ran into a forest and disappeared, suggesting that it was able to conceal itself among the plants and foliage. "Undergrowth" refers to the shrubs and small trees that grow beneath the larger trees in a forest, providing cover for animals like foxes. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to the landscape or the behavior of the fox.
The sentence suggests that there are different varieties of corn, and that Sam and June chose to buy loose corn because it was less expensive than another variety. The word "cobbed" refers to corn that has been removed from its cob and packaged, which makes it a likely candidate for the more expensive option. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John lives in a remote and isolated location where farming is no longer a prominent activity. This description matches the characteristics of a rural area, which is typically an area that is sparsely populated and dominated by agricultural or natural landscapes. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they either describe a specific type of building or location or do not meet the criteria of being remote and without farming activity.
Exercise is commonly associated with building strength and improving overall physical fitness. The other options, such as tiredness, exhaustion, getting sick, or using energy, do not directly relate to the benefits of exercise. In fact, exercising can actually help combat fatigue and increase energy levels. Therefore, the most logical answer is that people participate in exercising to become stronger and healthier.
The sentence suggests that exercising for many months will cause a decrease in something, which is most likely a physical change in the body. The term "weigh" is the only option that specifically refers to a physical measurement of the body, while the other options have more general or nebulous meanings. "Stretch" and "work out" may actually increase rather than decrease with exercise, while "expend energy" and "blood" are not necessarily associated with a change in weight.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys giving assistance, which implies that they have a positive attitude towards helping others. "Willing to help" is the choice that best fits this description. "Helpful" and "prepared" are related to being able to give assistance, but do not necessarily imply enjoyment. "Help one" is grammatically incorrect, and "go home" is not related to giving assistance at all.
The word "communication" implies the act of sharing or exchanging information or ideas between individuals or groups. The other choices such as "conductor" or "people to think" do not accurately reflect the motive behind communication. "Distributed information" could be another valid option, but "sharing of knowledge" implies a more active and intentional exchange of information rather than just passively disseminating it. "Confusion" is an opposite, and would not be a motive for communication but rather a potential negative consequence.
The sentence indicates that the person has saved up enough money to buy something significant. The mention of a dream entrance hall suggests that the purchase is related to a dwelling place and the use of the word "bought" indicates a purchase. "Hat rack" and "school" do not fit the context of purchasing a large home, while "palace" seems too grandiose for the given information. "Gateway" is also unlikely since it does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the friends gathered to engage in an enjoyable activity, which is commonly associated with playing cards. The phrase "have fun" is also often used in reference to social gatherings, which further supports this answer choice. The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence; for example, there is no indication that the friends were drinking alcohol or feeling bored.
The sentence suggests that there is additional code from another team that Saul needs to incorporate into his own program. The word "integrate" specifically refers to the process of combining different pieces of code or software systems into one cohesive program. The other options do not relate to incorporating new code and would not make sense in this context.
The question is asking for a factor that could prevent someone from being able to buy a house. Losing money is a common reason for many people not being able to afford a home. This might be due to a job loss, unexpected expenses or debt payment obligations. Bargaining, paying for, settling down or distance do not seem to imply a lack of affordability for buying a house.
The sentence suggests that the person is hungry in the evening, which is typically a time when people eat dinner. The phrase "cook dinner" specifically refers to the action of preparing a meal at home, which is a common activity for people who are hungry in the evening. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to meals at different times of day or involve going outside of the house to eat.
The word "messy" suggests that the injury can cause some sort of bodily fluid or substance to be present, which would be the case with bleeding. Infections and distress may not necessarily be messy, and while death may result from an injury, the term "messy" does not necessarily describe the outcome. "Hurts" is too general and could apply to any injury, but it does not necessarily imply messiness.
The sentence suggests that the tennis players are professionals playing for money, which implies that they are likely playing at a location where they can earn a living from the sport. Country clubs are often associated with higher-end tennis facilities that attract professional and semi-professional players, while college campuses and health clubs are more likely to have recreational players. Wimbledon is a specific location and may not be the correct answer depending on the context of the question. Outside is too broad, as professionals could be playing anywhere outdoors.
The sentence suggests that typing for a long time can be physically demanding and potentially harmful. Pain is a common signal from the body indicating that it is under stress or strain, and thus taking a break is necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also a potential health risk associated with typing and can cause pain, but it is a specific medical condition rather than a general sign one should take a break. Letter, thirst, and printed word are not related to the physical stress associated with typing.
Trees are often planted along rural roads, especially those located in the countryside, to provide shade and create a pleasing aesthetic. State parks and forests may also have trees lining the roads, but the context of the question implies a more common occurrence, which favors the countryside option. Gardens and yards may have trees, but they are not typically planted along roadsides.
The sentence implies that someone is struggling to learn about science, which suggests that they may feel frustrated. Learning can be a difficult process, and science is a complex subject that requires a lot of effort and dedication to master. Smiling or becoming happy may be unlikely responses to struggling with science, while accidents and experimentation are not related to the emotional experience of learning.
When a doctor prescribes medication, it means they are recommending a specific type and dosage of medication for a patient's health condition. Antibiotics are a type of medication that can only be obtained with a prescription. Therefore, the patient would need to take the prescription to a pharmacy where a licensed pharmacist would dispense the medication. The other options do not accurately reflect the proper process of obtaining a prescription antibiotic.
The sentence suggests that John is afraid of something that may harm him while he is sleeping, so he chooses to stay awake instead. The phrase "nothing can hurt you" implies that staying awake is seen as a way of protecting oneself from harm. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that there are many grains of sand being referred to, which when put together, form something. The only option that matches this description is "sand pile." The other options, such as "eye," "bathing suit," "clam," and "create pearl," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that John may be in a palace, which immediately rules out options such as a courtroom or office complex. The mention of a courtyard and a famous palace suggests that the location may be a historical landmark or tourist attraction. Spain, while it does have many famous palaces, is a broad option and therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Finally, the option "lawn" is clearly not the correct answer as it does not fit with the context of the sentence. This leaves "versailles" as the most likely option since it is known as a famous palace with a well-known courtyard.
The sentence suggests that the topic is the entire life cycle of animals. The other options are only specific actions that animals may do during their lives, while "live lives" encompasses their entire existence. It is also a basic fact that animals are born and then live until they die, which further supports the correct answer.
The sentence indicates that the employee was stocking a product, which typically involves placing it on a designated surface for customers to access. In a store setting, products are often stocked on shelves, making it the most likely option in this context. The other choices, such as display case and demonstration, do not fit the typical method of stocking a product in a retail setting. Market and store are too general and do not provide enough specific information to help make a choice.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a place where they can drive their car at high speeds. A racetrack is a common place for car racing or high-performance driving, where drivers can push their cars to their limits in a controlled environment. The other options do not provide a suitable location for high-speed driving. A garage or parking lot are confined spaces, while a freeway and side of the road have speed limits and regulations that prohibit reckless driving.
The question is asking for a place with a single ceiling that can also be located on the ground level. This rules out options such as airplanes, which have multiple levels and are not on the ground, and lofts, which are typically located aboveground. A house or building may have multiple ceilings, so those options can also be eliminated. A classroom, on the other hand, typically has a single ceiling and can be located on the ground level, making it the correct answer.
The question is asking about the consequences of a surprising event occurring while driving. One possible consequence is that it could lead to accidents, as unexpected events can cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles or collide with other cars. Fainting, being frightened or laughing do not seem to be appropriate responses to the situation, and "funny" is not a suitable answer in this context, as the question implies a potentially dangerous or serious scenario.
A tentative agreement usually means that parties involved have come to an understanding, but are not yet fully committed. A settlement, on the other hand, means that the agreement has been finalized and legally binding. The other choices, such as communication or celebration, do not necessarily indicate a finalized agreement. Parting ways also suggests that the negotiation did not reach a successful conclusion. Shaking hands may symbolize agreement, but it does not necessarily mean that a final decision has been reached.
The sentence suggests that hurting is associated with an emotional response, which is likely to be negative since the choices include "death," "punishment," and "accident." "More hurt" is also a possible response to hurting, but it is not a valid answer to the question because it is a physical response rather than an emotional one. "Feel sad" is the most appropriate answer because it aligns with the emotional connotations of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that diamonds have a high value because they are neither free nor cheap. The term "expensive" is commonly associated with objects that have a high monetary value. The other options, such as enslaved or imprisoned, do not make sense in the context of a discussion about the price of diamonds.
When making chicken salad, the chicken is typically cooked first and then chopped or shredded into smaller pieces before being mixed with the other ingredients. Baking, grilling, or buying pre-cooked chicken at the store would not necessarily result in the chicken being in smaller pieces. "Eaten" is not a method of preparing the chicken. Therefore, "chopped" is the most likely correct answer.
The sentence suggests that in order to keep a surprise party a surprise, one needs to do something specific. To keep a surprise party a surprise, one must keep the fact that there is a party a secret from the person who is being surprised. The other options are not related to keeping a surprise party a surprise in any way.
The question is asking for a unique trait that humans possess in comparison to most other animals. While some animals may have certain similarities anatomically, such as having two legs or two feet, the defining characteristic that sets humans apart is their brain power. Humans have evolved to develop a highly complex, sophisticated brain that allows for advanced thinking, problem-solving, and communication. Therefore, "brains" is the correct answer that aligns with the context of the question.
Inflation is often accompanied by rising prices, which can lead to an increase in interest rates. This is because the central bank may raise interest rates to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation. A higher interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, which can help to curb spending and reduce inflation. Therefore, being aware of rising interest rates is important when fighting inflation. The other options do not have a clear connection to inflation and loans.
The sentence suggests that the scientist was searching for a specific type of bird, the endangered toucan, and that he was doing so in a forest. South America is known for its dense and diverse rainforest regions, which are home to many species of exotic animals, including toucans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Playing football carelessly can lead to various injuries such as sprains, fractures, and concussions. Injuries are a common consequence of not taking safety precautions seriously while playing physical sports like football. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they describe positive outcomes of playing football, whereas the phrase "too carelessly" suggests a negative impact.
Pet stores are well-known for selling pets, including dogs, so this choice would make the most sense in the context of the question. The other options, such as outside, neighbor's house, park, and rug, do not provide any clear indication of where one would obtain a dog.
The most common reason for someone to try to cash in a check is to receive payment for work or services rendered. The other options, such as "extra money," "great joy," "quitting," or "profit," do not necessarily pertain to the act of cashing a check.
Passengers who are planning to travel to another continent are most likely to be found at an airport. Airports are the main hubs for international travel, and are where travelers usually board planes to travel to other countries or continents. The other options are unlikely to have passengers traveling long distances, and are more commonly used for shorter journeys within a city or region.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to keep the antibiotic out of reach of children, implying that it should be stored in a secure location. A medicine cabinet is a common location for storing medications that need to be kept out of reach of children. Storing the antibiotic in the stomach or a capsule does not make sense as these are not storage locations, and being prescribed or coming from a pharmacy does not provide any information about where to store the medication.
The sentence indicates that when a can of spray paint is shaken, there is a sound or movement that occurs. The word "rattle" implies a shaking or clanking noise, which is a common characteristic of a can of spray paint being shaken. The other options do not accurately describe the expected result of shaking a can of spray paint.
The sentence suggests that the symbol on the bottom of the glass bottle is related to its properties or intended use. The options "combustible," "dirty," and "very fragile" do not seem relevant in this context, while "clear" is a characteristic of glass that does not require a symbol to indicate it. Therefore, it is likely that the symbol indicates that the bottle can be recycled, which is a common practice for glass containers.
The context of the sentence indicates that George is tired of his current living situation, which suggests that he is likely referring to his apartment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about an action that is typically associated with having lunch. Eating is the most logical choice as it is the main activity that usually takes place during a meal. Hunger is a sensation that someone might experience before or after lunch, but it is not an action. Burping and laughing are unrelated to the act of having lunch, while food is a broad category that could refer to any aspect of a meal.
When a plane reaches its destination, it must land on a runway. The runway is specifically designed for planes to take off and land safely. The other options do not make sense in the context of a plane reaching its destination. The plane may be in the air during flight, but it must eventually land on the runway. "Eat" and "fall" are not relevant to the question.
Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and are known to burrow in the ground or rocks. Therefore, the option "wilderness" seems like the most appropriate choice as it is a vast area of undeveloped land with diverse terrain and vegetation which can provide a suitable habitat for marmots to thrive. The other options such as "jungle" or "new zealand" do not align with the natural habitat of marmots.
The question is asking for a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger, which suggests that they may not have had access to a lot of money or resources. Making bread is a simple and inexpensive way to feed a family, as it only requires basic ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and salt. Going to the store, going to the market, or bringing home fish may not have been viable options for a medieval family depending on their location, income, and availability of resources. Eating a hamburger is not a plausible option because hamburgers did not exist during medieval times.
Solidity refers to the state of being firm, stable, and strong. Hollowness, on the other hand, is the opposite, as it suggests that something is empty or lacking substance. The other options do not convey this sense of opposition to solidity, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Openness and fluidity suggest a lack of constraint, while weakness and instability suggest a vulnerability, which are not directly related to solidity.
x is a brand name of facial tissue typically used for wiping or blowing one's nose. While it is possible to carry individual tissues in a purse or pocket, the question specifically asks about where Kleenex is originally obtained from. The most common way to obtain Kleenex is by purchasing a box of tissues from a store or supermarket.
The sentence suggests that Bill struggles with riding his bike uphill, indicating that it requires a significant amount of physical exertion. The phrase "pushed himself to the point of" implies that Bill's physical activity was so strenuous that it caused him to experience a negative consequence. "Exhaustion" is the only choice that accurately reflects the consequences of over-exertion, while "falling down", "give up", "travelling", and "going somewhere" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the feeling one experiences after working hard to improve at chess and succeeding is related to a sense of achievement or fulfillment. The choice "satisfaction" best captures this idea. "Smart" may be a feeling one experiences after successfully solving a challenging problem or learning something new, but it is not necessarily the feeling associated with improving at chess. "Have fun" is not the most fitting choice as it does not reflect the idea of hard work paying off. "Made" is not a feeling, it is a verb. "Superior" is not the most fitting choice as it implies a sense of dominance or superiority over others, which may not be the case in this scenario.
The sentence suggests that the instrument in question is a popular one and usually has four strings. The options trumpet, kite, quark, and bird's nest are either not instruments or do not have the characteristic of having four strings. The guitar, on the other hand, is a popular instrument that typically has four strings, making it the correct answer.
The options include different types of establishments, but the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to their personal oven. It is unlikely that a person would have access to an oven in a prison, school or restaurant setting, and while there may be ovens in pizza places, the most common place for an individual to have an oven is in their own home.
illing someone is a serious act that often elicits strong emotions. While it is possible that someone may feel scared or worried about getting caught and going to jail, the term "remorse" specifically refers to a feeling of deep regret or guilt about a past action, which is more likely to apply to someone who has taken another person's life. The term "horrible" is also associated with negative emotions, but it is not specific enough to the context of the question. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotional response to killing someone.

The question is asking for the result or consequence of hurting someone else. "Suffering" is a logical choice because it describes the pain or distress that the person who was hurt is likely to experience. The other options do not adequately capture the consequence of causing harm to another person. "Punishment" and "arrested" may be consequences from a legal or social perspective, but they do not necessarily describe the emotional or physical result of being hurt. "Anger" and "hatred" may be emotions that the injured party may feel, but they do not describe the physical or emotional pain that results from being hurt.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is standing in front of people while holding index cards. This is a common practice during giving an oral report or presentation. The use of index cards can help the speaker remember important points and stay organized while delivering a speech. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "bugle" is often associated with military and is typically used to signal specific events, such as reveille in the morning. In this context, the sentence suggests that a bugle sounded every morning at a location related to military operations or training. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context.
The term "level up" is commonly associated with video games, where players progress through different levels of difficulty as they gain experience points. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of leveling up. A garage, food court, carpenter's shop, or building may have different purposes but do not relate to the gaming context.
Birds typically clean themselves by bathing in water, either in natural bodies of water, such as rivers or ponds, or in man-made structures like bird baths or water fountains. The other options do not involve water or a place where birds could bathe. Nest is where they live, outside is too general, birdhouse is where they rest, and roof doesn't involve any water source for bird cleaning.
The sentence suggests that the player in the video game preferred to use the rocket launcher from a distance, indicating that the weapon was best suited for long-range combat. However, when the player was up close, they switched to a weapon with a fast firing rate, suggesting that they needed to take out enemies quickly. The assault rifle, submachine gun, and shotgun all have rapid fire capabilities, but the shotgun is typically used for close-range combat, making it an unlikely choice. The pistol and grenade launcher do not have the rapid firing capabilities suggested in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is submachine gun.
The question suggests that the waiter has already provided drinks, which is typically an early step in the dining experience. After providing drinks, the waiter's next action is often to present the bill so that the guests can pay and leave. The other options are less likely to follow immediately after providing drinks and do not fit the typical sequence of events in a dining experience.
The sentence suggests that the angst filled teenager did not appreciate something that is related to rolling hills. The only option that seems related to rolling hills is landscape, which typically includes hills and other natural features. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the painting was created while the person was feeling angry, which is likely to have influenced the resulting artwork. Anger is a strong emotion, and it is likely that the painting conveyed this emotion inadvertently. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence - while creating art can be a work of art, a feeling of accomplishment or pleasure, these options do not connect with the fact that the creator was angry while making it. Making love is also a completely unrelated option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that passing a bill is a slow and tedious process, which is commonly associated with the US Congress. The US Congress is responsible for passing bills into law, and the process often involves long debates, negotiations, and revisions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The universe is the vast expanse of space that contains all matter, including stars, planets, and galaxies. It is unlikely that anyone could ever see all parts of the universe, let alone light within it. Therefore, the correct answer is universe. The other options all have surfaces or openings where light can enter, reflect, or emit, making them visible to the naked eye.
Hadrons are composite particles made up of quarks held together by the strong force. This is a fundamental concept in the branch of physics known as particle physics, which includes string theory. The other choices have no connection to the concept of hadrons or particle physics.
The question is asking for the most efficient way to sell things to customers. Shipping goods directly to customers is often the most efficient method as it eliminates the need for a physical store or additional branches, and allows for larger quantities of products to be transported at once. Owning a factory may be efficient for producing the products, but it does not necessarily mean that the company can efficiently sell them. Branching out may increase accessibility, but it may not necessarily be the most efficient option. Mail order requires customers to wait for the product to be delivered, which may not be the most efficient option for all customers.
The context suggests that the paint that Jim considered using would have covered up the natural beauty of the wood. This implies that the paint is not transparent and therefore, opaque would be the best answer. Opal refers to a type of gemstone and does not make sense in this context. Obscured and obscure mean to make unclear or difficult to understand, and thick does not necessarily imply that the paint would cover up the natural beauty of the wood.
The sentence suggests that even though John disliked waiting in line, he still chose to do it anyway. The phrase "not breaking line" implies that John felt a sense of obligation to follow the rules and be considerate of others in the queue. Therefore, the correct choice would be something that relates to being polite or showing good manners, such as "civil". The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence states that the person was washing their hands, which implies that their hands became wet as a result. The other options do not make sense in the context of washing hands. "Jazz hands" is a type of dance move and has nothing to do with washing hands. "Health" is a broad and vague option that does not provide enough context to make sense as an answer choice. "Skin irritation" and "dry skin" may be possible outcomes of washing hands with harsh soaps or chemicals, but the sentence does not provide any indication that this is what happened.
The sentence describes a muscle, and the word "stretched" implies that it was previously extended or lengthened. In this context, when a muscle "contracts," it means that it is shortening and tightening back up again. This is a normal and healthy response to stretching, as it helps to strengthen the muscle and improve its flexibility. The other options do not fit with what typically happens to a muscle after it has been stretched.
In this context, "fail after giving an answer" suggests that the person's answer was incorrect. "Wrong" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to giving an incorrect answer. "Problem" and "question" are too general and don't necessarily imply an incorrect answer. "Ask" and "swear" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the drunk man was angry or frustrated, and he expressed this emotion by slamming a bottle down on something. The most logical option is the table, as it is a common object that can be found near someone who is drinking. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence; buying beer and getting a ticket are unrelated to the man's behavior, aim is not a tangible object, and breaking is a consequence of the man's action rather than the target of it.
The sentence suggests that the human wants to be in a warm place, which eliminates options like "in the fridge." The context of the question further suggests that the choice should be a location rather than a profession, which eliminates options like "doctor" and "workplace." The remaining option that fits the context is "mexico," as it is a country with a warm climate.
Round brushes are commonly used in the hair salon industry for styling and blow-drying hair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of round brushes.
The sentence suggests that the guest was asking the woman how she keeps her home in good condition. The answer given by the woman emphasizes the importance of not neglecting housework, which implies that her home is typically very clean. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence – feeling satisfied and boredom are emotions, while nice home and pristine house suggest a higher level of cleanliness than simply maintaining a clean house.
The sentence implies that the exercise involved deep and slow breathing, which is a common technique used to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Other options, such as warm air, staying alive, or living, do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence. Calmness is a possible alternative, but relaxation is a more specific and commonly used term for the desired outcome of breathing exercises.
The sentence suggests that chicken is not a popular option, so it's important to choose another form of nourishment that is likely to be more palatable. Of the options given, beef is the most likely to be a safe bet, as it is a commonly consumed source of protein and is often used as a substitute for chicken in dishes. Freezer, plate, and pizza are not sources of nourishment, and a fast food restaurant is not a specific type of food.
The question is asking specifically about something that can be used to carry a small dog, so options like swimming pool, dog show, backyard, and own home do not make logical sense. A basket, however, is often used to transport small animals, and would be a reasonable choice for carrying a small dog.
The word "corporeal" in the sentence means physical or tangible, so the evidence mentioned is something that can be touched or seen. The sentence also suggests that most of the evidence would not be useful, which implies that it might be intangible or not physically present. Therefore, the correct answer is "intangible," as it means something that cannot be touched or has no physical substance. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they refer to things that are not physical.
The word "hanging" suggests that the files are being stored vertically rather than horizontally. The only option that allows for vertical storage is the filing cabinet. The other options - tree, suitcase, computer, and desk drawer - do not typically involve files being stored in a vertical position.
The sentence clearly states that the man was caught stabbing his wife to death, which implies that he committed the act of killing. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the crime that the man committed.
The sentence suggests that the crab is a sea creature and that it uses camouflage tactics to catch prey. "Ocean floor" is the only option that relates to the habitat of sea creatures. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "at war with one another" implies a violent conflict, which often leads to actions such as destruction and aggression. "Interact" and "talk to each other" are not likely scenarios in the context of war, as the parties involved are typically not in a position to negotiate or communicate effectively. "Run amok" is a vague term that does not provide enough context to indicate a logical consequence of war. "Desire to win" is a general statement that could apply to many situations, but it does not specifically address the consequences of war.
The sentence suggests that the performance was impressive and had a strong impact on the people who witnessed it. The use of the word "eloquent" further indicates that the performance was characterized by a high level of skill and proficiency. The word "astounded" is the most appropriate choice for describing the reaction of the audience to such a performance, as it conveys a sense of awe and amazement. The other options do not convey the same level of impact or intensity that would be associated with a stunning performance.
The question is asking about problems specifically related to children learning about the world. Of the given choices, frustration seems to be the most related to this topic, as children may struggle to understand complex concepts or may find it difficult to process new information. Confusion, anger, and sadness may also be emotions that children experience while learning, but they do not necessarily pertain specifically to the process of learning about the world. Loss of innocence may be a theme in some cases, but it is not a direct problem that children face when learning about the world.
The sentence mentions that John went to get an authentic pizza, which is a popular dish in Italy. Additionally, the mention of a terrace and balcony suggests a European-style building, which further supports the idea that John might be in Italy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the customer was looking for a larger selection or more options than what was available locally, and this implies that the customer was looking for a bigger selection offered in a more populous area. The urban connotation of "city" fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options have limited relevance to the context, as a dancehall and theater refer to specific types of buildings, a car dealership refers to a specific type of business, and Vegas, short for Las Vegas, would not be considered a local place for most people.
Perjury is a serious crime that involves lying under oath in a legal setting. If someone is found guilty of committing perjury, they may face legal consequences such as fines, probation, or even imprisonment. Going to jail is a common punishment for this offense. Embarrassment and tension may also be feelings that someone experiences in relation to committing perjury, but they are not legal consequences. Mistrial is also not a direct consequence of perjury, but rather a legal decision to invalidate a trial due to some other issue. A lawyer is not a consequence, but rather someone who may be involved in defending or prosecuting a case involving perjury.
The sentence suggests that the couple had a conflict or disagreement, but were able to move past it with a forgiving attitude. "Make up" is a common expression used to describe the act of resolving a disagreement and becoming friends again. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the warranty was purchased as a precautionary measure for fragile objects. Fragile objects are prone to breaking, and the purpose of a warranty is typically to provide coverage in case of damage or defects. Therefore, the correct answer is "become broken." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that wisdom is acquired over time, which implies that the person is aging and accumulating life experience. The phrase "as you live life" also supports this idea. The other options, such as toothsome and breathe, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Ballet dancing is a form of artistic expression, where dancers use their bodies to convey emotions, tell stories, and express themselves. Swan Lake is a famous ballet, but it is not a broader category that could be used to describe ballet dancing as a whole. Intercourse and fatigue have no connection to ballet dancing or artistic expression, and "become tired" is not a category that could be used to describe any form of dance.
The sentence suggests that John heard a loud noise coming from below him, indicating that he is living in a multi-level building. The phrase "perfectly normal" suggests that the noise is a regular occurrence, and it happens at a specific time of the day. The phrase "he really hated living here" implies that John is not happy with his living situation. Based on these clues, the correct answer is "upstairs," as it is the only option that is related to living in a building with multiple levels. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that people are experiencing antique transportation as a form of entertainment. A car show is a popular event where antique cars are displayed and people can observe and interact with them. The other options do not have any clear connection to antique transportation, or are unlikely places where such an activity would take place.
The options "gymnasium" and "bearing" are unlikely because they do not typically involve outdoor play. "Street" may have children playing, but it is not a designated area for children and is not very safe. "Playground" and "park" are both places designed for children to play and engage in physical activity, making them the most likely options.
Hair gel is commonly used in styling hair, and the profession of applying hair gel typically falls under the beauty or salon industry. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of professionals applying hair gel. A dressing room may be used for wardrobe changes, a perfumery typically sells fragrances rather than hair products, a bathroom is a common place to apply hair products but does not imply the presence of professionals, and while barbers also work with hair, they do not specialize in applying hair gel.
The sentence suggests that the person takes competition seriously and works hard even when playing simple games. This implies that the person puts in physical effort and might sweat due to the exertion. The other options do not necessarily reflect physical exertion or hard work during competition.
When a child is missing, a parent's first course of action should be to contact law enforcement as soon as possible. Time is of the essence when it comes to finding missing children, so getting the police involved right away is crucial. While a parent may feel fear and worry in such a situation, that is not the action they would take to find their child. Homeschooling and closing a box are irrelevant and have no connection to the context of the question.
Playing games is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment, which is typically described as "having fun." While some games can be challenging or competitive, the primary purpose of playing games is usually to engage in an enjoyable activity. The option "bored" is listed twice, making it an unlikely correct answer as it does not offer any new information. "Win" and "challenge" may also be possible outcomes of playing games, but they do not capture the essence of the experience in the same way "having fun" does.
The sentence suggests that when people are not communicating or talking to each other, something negative happens. The word "misunderstandings" implies a lack of clear communication between individuals, which can lead to confusion and conflict. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the negative effects of a lack of communication.
A small dog is most likely a pet and would usually have a designated sleeping area within its owner's home. A backyard or garage may not provide adequate shelter or safety for a dog at night, and an animal shelter is not a suitable long-term option for a pet. A basket could be a good option, but it is not exclusive to dogs and may not provide enough warmth or comfort.
The sentence suggests that the cost of beer is higher at a certain type of public event. Sporting events are known for having high prices on food and beverages due to demand and the captive audience. Refrigerator, drink, and fridge are irrelevant to the context of the sentence, while bowling alley could be a possibility but is not commonly associated with expensive beer prices.
The sentence suggests that seeing new people move in next door will elicit a certain response. The word "interesting" implies that there is a level of curiosity or intrigue involved. The other options may be possible, but do not capture the sense of curiosity suggested by the sentence. "New friends" assumes a positive outcome that may not always occur, "new experience" is too vague and could refer to any number of things, "look around" is not a response but rather an action that may occur as a result, and "change of surroundings" may not necessarily be interesting.
Based on common knowledge and biology, it is known that two adults engage in sexual intercourse before the woman gives birth to a child. The other options do not accurately describe the process that leads to childbirth. "Loving couple" and "consent" may be necessary factors for healthy and consensual sexual intercourse, but they do not directly answer the question. "Birth" and "parents" refer to the end result and relationship status, respectively, rather than the action that precedes childbirth.
The sentence suggests that when people are busy, they tend to do something in response. "Hurry along" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of urgency and rapid movement, which is a common response to being busy. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of being busy. Making lists may be a response to being organized, but not necessarily busy. Trading places and talking to each other do not necessarily indicate a response to busyness. Saying "hello" to one another may indicate social interaction, but not necessarily a response to busyness.
The word "inebriated" is commonly used to describe the state of being drunk or intoxicated. People who are drunk often have difficulty maintaining their balance and walking in a straight line, leading to a staggering or swaying movement. Jumping and fighting are not necessarily associated with being drunk, and paralysis would make it impossible for the person to move at all.
The sentence suggests that Johnny's behavior after the original incident was not acceptable. The use of "completely" indicates that his actions were extreme. "Accidental" suggests that Johnny's behavior was unintentional, which contradicts the sentence's suggestion that his actions were a problem. "Detestable" suggests that Johnny's behavior was deliberately offensive, which could be a possibility, but there is no evidence to support this in the sentence. "Effusive" suggests that Johnny's behavior was excessively emotional, which does not fit the context. "Enabled" suggests that someone facilitated Johnny's behavior, which also does not fit the context. Therefore, "shocking" is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence states that Mary is a high school student, which indicates that she is most likely attending classes in a school. The sentence also suggests that Mary was studying, which further supports the idea that she was in a classroom or library, both of which are common places for students to study. The other options, such as university, dinner, or every aspect of life, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the woman had a busy schedule and needed to run errands and pick up her kids "the second she did" something. This implies that whatever she did would directly affect her ability to complete her tasks. Choosing "leave work" makes the most sense in this context, as leaving work would give her the time to run her errands and pick up her kids. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the child's mother was told that she was distracting her downstairs neighbors, implying that the noise was the problem. Jumping up and down on the floor is likely to cause a lot of noise, which is why the mother was reprimanded. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not involve making loud noise.
The sentence suggests that the person waited too long before starting work, which implies that they are now in a state of urgency, potentially experiencing stress or panic. Excitement and eagerness may be associated with starting work, but the phrase "waited too long" suggests a negative connotation, ruling those answers out. "Working" is a state of action, not a state of mind.
tucky is known as the horse capital of the world and has a long history of breeding and raising high-quality horses. Many famous horse races, such as the Kentucky Derby, are held in Kentucky, and the state has a large number of horse farms and breeders. The other options do not have any clear connection to horse breeding or quality.
The sentence suggests that the person was motivated by the desire to make money. One common way to achieve this goal is by selling goods or services. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "out of its cage" suggests that the lizard is being kept in some kind of enclosure or captivity. The other options, such as Costa Rica or a river, do not relate to the concept of captivity or being in a cage. Encyclopedia and garden may be related to lizards but do not give information about the lizard's status.
Bridges are typically built on strong foundations that can support the weight of the structure and withstand the forces of nature. Foundations made of rock are often preferred because they provide stability and durability. Pillars may also be built on rock foundations, but they are typically smaller structures than bridges. Mountains and mountain ranges are natural features that are not built by humans, and the surface of the earth is too broad to be considered a foundation for a specific structure.
When jumping a car, the positive terminal of a live battery is connected to the positive terminal of the dead battery, and then the negative terminal of the live battery is connected to a metal ground point on the dead car (such as a bolt or a metal surface). Therefore, after connecting the positive terminal, the next step is to connect the negative terminal. The term "negative" is also commonly used to refer to the negative terminal of a battery, making it a logical choice for the answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the drama had a strong emotional impact on the humans who experienced it, which can be inferred from the phrase "highs and lows." This indicates that the humans were experiencing a range of emotions, which would make them emotional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a squirrel ran up to its home, which is most likely a tree. Therefore, it is likely that the small dog would be barking up a tree as it may have spotted the squirrel and is trying to catch its attention. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "dry" suggests that the items to be stored may be affected by moisture or humidity. A pantry is typically a cool, dry place designed for storing food items such as canned goods, cereal, and non-perishables. A storage closet may also be dry, but it's not typically associated with food storage. A building or warehouse may not have the right conditions for dry storage, and "inside" is too general and does not provide enough context.
A cupboard is a type of storage unit often found in kitchens that typically contains plates, bowls, and other kitchenware. The fact that the bowl is "nestled among other bowls" suggests that it would be found in a storage area with other similar items, such as in a cupboard. The other options do not typically contain or store bowls in the kitchen.
The sentence suggests that people have differing opinions, which implies that they are in a position to agree or disagree with one another. Divorce, belief in God, and gaining weight do not have any logical connection to this context. Becoming angry is a possible emotional response, but it is not a direct action that people can take with one another.
The word "grooming" suggests that the person is concerned with appearance and hygiene, which often involves smoothing out roughness in skin or hair. Therefore, someone obsessed with grooming is likely to enjoy smoothness. The other options are not necessarily related to grooming or appearance.
The sentence suggests that the government was targeting people who were protesting, which typically involves speaking out against authority or challenging the status quo. This indicates that the government likely disliked people who questioned authority, making "question authority" the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Bill is most likely speaking in a religious setting, such as a church. The idea of giving money to someone in exchange for good things happening is often associated with religious practices, such as tithing. The other options, such as a stadium, hockey game, baseball game, or movie theater, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence clearly states that Joe wants to end his marriage to Jane, which suggests that they are discussing a divorce. The option "getting divorce" directly addresses this point and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, such as "pleasure" and "beatings," do not make sense in the context of this sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. "Heartache" and "heartbreak" could potentially make sense, but they do not directly address the specific action that Jane is accepting (i.e. a divorce).
The sentence suggests that Billy enjoys learning and appreciating various subjects, but is not particularly skilled in one of them (art). When he visited the museum, he likely experienced a sense of wonder and amazement at the various works of art on display, even though he may not have felt creatively inspired to create his own art. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Water is an essential element when it comes to cleaning clothes. It is used to rinse out stains and dirt from fabric, especially when combined with detergent. While sorting may be helpful in organization, it is not a necessary step in cleaning clothes. Bleach is a type of cleaning agent that may be used in some cases, but not in all, and getting dirty is the opposite of cleaning. Laundering is the process of cleaning clothes, so it is not a necessary item you need in addition to water.
The sentence suggests that the screwdriver was unexpectedly sharp, which may indicate that it was not designed to be sharp. The word "sharp" in this context typically refers to a point or edge that can pierce or cut through objects. In contrast, the word "flat" means lacking in sharpness, which could explain why the screwdriver's surprisingly sharp tip was unexpected. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the local government in question is located in the eastern U.S. and has a thriving crab fishing industry. Chesapeake Bay is well-known for its abundant blue crabs and is located on the eastern coast of the U.S. North Carolina is also located on the eastern coast, but there is no indication in the sentence that it has a significant crab fishing industry. Crab pots are a tool used in crab fishing, but they are not a governmental entity. Sandy beach and eastern coast are too broad and do not provide a specific location.
The other options - wash clothes, cellar, house, and garage - all make sense as places where one might put a washing machine. However, a laundromat is a public place where people go to do their laundry, and each machine is typically shared by many people throughout the day. It would be odd for someone to put a personal washing machine in a laundromat since it is intended for individual use.
The word "eat" implies that the chocolate cake is a food item meant for consumption. While it may be possible to eat a chocolate cake at home from a box, the other options (mouth, school, and supermarket) are not feasible locations to eat a chocolate cake. A restaurant is a likely choice because it is a place where food is served and eaten. Therefore, the correct answer is "restaurant."
The phrase "unwanted flirting" suggests that the flirting is not welcome or appreciated by the recipient. In this context, the result of such behavior would likely be negative, such as causing problems or leading to a physical altercation like being slapped. The other options do not fit with the negative connotations of the phrase "unwanted flirting."
The sentence implies that the divorce between the two individuals resulted in negative emotions or a strained relationship, as evidenced by their lack of communication. While some of the other options may be a result of a divorce, the context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to the emotional effects of their separation.
A cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, typically in a kitchen or dining area. It would be a logical place to put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon, as it could be kept out of the way and protected from spills or other accidents. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. A camelback is a type of hydration pack worn on the back, a cup and can are both used to drink from, and a backpack is for carrying items, not storing drinks.
The sentence states that James decided not to accept temptation, which implies that he actively chose to resist it. The word "reject" is the only option that accurately reflects this action, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Predetermination" refers to something being decided beforehand, "undecided" means not having made a choice yet, "force" implies using physical or emotional pressure, and "concluded" means coming to a decision after consideration.
Monkeys are typically found in tropical areas, such as rainforests, where they live in the trees and forage for food. They are not typically found in school, research laboratories, or pet stores, as they are wild animals and not domesticated. While monkeys may appear in storybooks, this is not a reliable indicator of their real-life habitats.
Attaching a chain to a car bumper is a common practice for tow trucks, which are used to transport vehicles that are unable to move on their own. The other options, such as obesity, bicycle, motorbike, and jewelry store, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a reason why someone might avoid getting a new car. One of the most common reasons for avoiding a new car is the expense. New cars are often more expensive than used cars and require more ongoing financial investment in terms of maintenance, repair costs, and insurance premiums. The other answer choices have no clear connection to the context of the question.
Generally, computers are known for their ability to process and manipulate large amounts of data, making them useful in a variety of contexts. While some advanced systems may be capable of more complex tasks such as decision-making, the primary function of most computers is to process information quickly and accurately. The other options, such as thinking or making decisions, are typically associated with human intelligence and are not capabilities typically associated with computers.
The sentence suggests that eating only ice cream is not a healthy choice when one is hungry. This implies that there are healthier food options available when one is hungry. The other options like being depressed, cooling down or letting the ice cream melt in the mouth do not have any clear relation to the context of the sentence. The option of exercising may be a healthy choice but it is not suggested as an alternative in the sentence.
The use of the word "unprepared" suggests that the person taking the final exams is not ready for the test. This could lead to feelings of stress, nervousness, and anxiety. Graduation and graduating are not relevant because they suggest a task that has already been completed (not something that is about to be undertaken). Happy is not relevant because the sentence is discussing a negative emotion, and headaches may be a side effect of stress but are not the main focus of this sentence.
The sentence suggests that the champagne had a sweet taste as well as another quality that is complementary to sweetness. The opposite of sweet is often considered to be sour, bitter, or spicy, which do not fit with the context of the sentence. Decaying is not a taste, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Dryness is often used to describe the taste of champagne and is a common characteristic of high-quality sparkling wines. Therefore, dry is the correct answer.
Bottles typically have a narrower neck and wider body, making it necessary to hold them by the neck to ensure a firm grip. Holding a glass by the neck doesn't make much sense, as glasses are typically wider at the base, and holding them by the neck would result in an unstable grip. "Shoulder" and "body" are not descriptors of a type of drink, and "guillotine" is not related to drinks at all, so the correct answer is "bottle".
The mulberry bush is a common place referenced in the classic nursery rhyme "Pop Goes the Weasel," suggesting that it would be a good place for a weasel to hide. The other options do not have any clear connections to weasels or their behavior.
The question is asking for something that every person has that not every wolf has. The answer is likely to be a trait or characteristic that distinguishes humans from wolves. Out of the choices given, only "name" fits this criteria as wolves do not typically have names, while humans are commonly given names. The other choices, such as "human intelligence," "hide," "mouth," and "heart" may be traits that both humans and wolves have in common.
The sentence suggests that the person needed a computer program to complete a task, and he had the knowledge of how to make it. Therefore, he would logically start to write code in order to create the program. Debugging comes after writing code and refers to the process of finding and fixing errors in the code. Getting frustrated or damaging the computer are unlikely actions one would take in this situation. Compiling is the process of turning code into a program, but it is done after writing and debugging the code.
The word "convivial" suggests a friendly and sociable atmosphere, which is conducive to forming new connections and relationships. When people are in a convivial setting, they tend to be open and receptive to meeting new people, which can lead to the formation of friendships. The other choices (expect miracles, think of life, talk to each other, arguments) do not necessarily pertain to the context of the sentence, and do not align with the expectation of a convivial setting.
The sentence suggests that taking a break affects work in a particular way. Based on this, relaxation and renewal are the most likely options, as they both denote positive outcomes of taking a break. "Distractions" and "delay" suggest negative impacts, while "snoring" is not related to the context at all.
The context of the question suggests that the answer should be something that is commonly consumed with drinks. While a show, bar, dinner, and refrigerator may be associated with drinks in certain situations, soda is a classic beverage that is often served alongside alcoholic drinks or other types of beverages. It is also a common option for people who want a non-alcoholic drink to accompany their meal or snack.
The sentence implies that the fast food restaurant is present in multiple locations across a wide area. The option "america" is the most fitting answer as it encompasses anywhere in the United States where the restaurant may have a presence. The other options such as "big cities", "center of town" or "Los Angeles" are too specific and do not cover the entirety of the restaurant's potential locations.
The sentence suggests that Bob has a variety of hobbies or activities that he enjoys, as evidenced by his interest in both geology and waterskiing. The word "interests" is the most appropriate choice to describe this, as it refers to the things that someone enjoys doing in their free time. The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence.
The keyword "slope" suggests that the answer should be the opposite of something that is sloped or inclined. "Flat ground" is the only option that fits this description, as it indicates a surface that is level and without any significant changes in elevation. The other options either imply a decline or an incline, which contradicts the meaning of the keyword in the question.
The sentence indicates that the referee is skilled in refereeing various games and has been offered a job that he is unsure of. The fact that the job offer doesn't specify a particular game suggests that it could be a position in a general sporting event. The options related to specific games such as football, hockey or boxing are not supported by the given information. The choice "side with opponent" is contradictory to a referee's role and doesn't make sense in the context.
The question asks about short term effects of eating hamburgers in excess, which suggests that the answer should be a relatively immediate consequence. While gaining weight and health problems can be long term consequences of consuming too many hamburgers, nausea is a common side effect of overeating or eating greasy or heavy foods. Death and tomato are not logical options for this question.
The sentence suggests that the friends have commented on the condition of the person's living space, indicating that it may be messy or cluttered. In this situation, it would be appropriate to clean the room in order to address the issue that has been pointed out by the friends. The other options do not provide a solution to the problem.
The sentence suggests that a small ball is being bounced by someone or something, and one of the options refers to a "child's hand," which is a common place for a child to hold and bounce a small ball. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a soccer game involves a larger ball, the street and sidewalk may refer to bouncing a ball, but not specifically a small one, and a toy store is not a likely place for a ball to be bounced.
Ring roads are commonly used in European cities to help ease traffic congestion by providing a bypass around the city center. While other options may have freeway systems or cars, there is no indication that these factors would necessarily lead to the use of a ring road.
The sentence implies that the location where one gains knowledge is relevant to the answer. The options "apartment", "house", and "table" do not indicate a specific context for learning. However, "school" is a common location where people use computers to gain knowledge through research, studying, and online classes. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "school".
The question suggests that there is something that occurs between two points, which implies some sort of action or motion. The other choices do not accurately describe what passes between two points in space or time. "Relaxation" and "uneasiness" are emotions and cannot physically pass between two points, while an "obstacle" would impede or block movement and "elapsed time" is a measure of time, not a physical entity that passes between two points.
The question is asking about a common hiding place for young boys to keep dirty magazines, which implies that the material is likely inappropriate or taboo. The bed is a common hiding place for personal items, such as magazines, because it provides privacy and can be easily accessed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
A cup is a common item that is typically used to serve a beverage, such as coffee or tea. Restaurants are places where people often gather to have a meal and drinks, so it is likely that someone would bring you a cup at a restaurant. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks specifically about hanging notes in the kitchen, which suggests that the notes are likely related to grocery lists, reminders, or messages for family members. The fridge is a common location for hanging such notes as it is a central and easily accessible spot in the kitchen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Fleas are known for feeding on the blood of their hosts, which is likely the cause of the dog itching. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of fleas. Biting and attacking may be related to flea behavior in some way, but sucking blood is the most accurate answer based on the information given in the sentence. Jumping and laying eggs are also behaviors associated with fleas, but they are not directly related to why the dog is itching.
The sentence suggests that the buildings were designed to accommodate a large number of people, which is characteristic of urban areas where population density is high. Large cities are typically designed to have a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, in order to support the needs of a large population. University and town are not likely to have the same level of infrastructure or population as a city, while in a hole and small are not feasible options for the construction of such buildings.
Breathing is a necessary function for all living beings, and it is essential for sustaining life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Learning and marriage may enhance one's life, but they are not essential for survival. Sorrow is a negative emotion and cannot be considered a requirement for living life. Wear a mullet is a nonsensical option and has no relevance to the question.
The use of the word "shapes" in the sentence suggests that the geometry teacher is discussing various geometric figures. The term "object" is the most general of the choices and could encompass any kind of three-dimensional shape. The other choices are more specific and may not be relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that if you eat a very big hamburger, you will experience a certain outcome. One likely outcome is that you will feel full, since the hamburger is likely to fill up your stomach. The other options do not make logical sense or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker knows the answer to a question or problem, but they do not know what to do with it. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this feeling of uncertainty or confusion. Among the given choices, "understand" is the most appropriate answer because it implies that the speaker has grasped the meaning or solution to the problem, but needs more information or guidance on how to act on it. The other options are either irrelevant or inconsistent with the context of the sentence.
The question asks what physical condition a driver could have that would make them not want to drive their car. A backache is a common physical ailment that can make it uncomfortable or painful to sit for prolonged periods of time, such as when driving a car. The other options, such as car crashes, splinters, automobile accidents, and smoke, are not related to a physical condition that would specifically affect a driver's ability or desire to drive.
The use of a flashlight by a policeman in the street typically indicates that they are trying to direct traffic. This is often done during busy periods, accidents or when there is a breakdown in the usual traffic flow. The other options such as jumping, arresting criminals, or booking robbers do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the protagonist was worried about his possessions and cleaning up, which indicates that the party took place in their own residence. Home is the only option that could reasonably explain why someone would be concerned about cleaning up and keeping an eye on their belongings during a party. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A farmers market is a location where farmers and other vendors sell fresh produce directly to consumers. It is likely that the freshest apples would be found at a farmers market because they are sold directly from the farm to the consumer without any storage or transportation in between. The other options, such as a grocery store or fridge, may not have as fresh of produce as they may have been stored or transported for longer periods of time.
The word "outward" suggests that the answer is related to something that can be seen or heard. "Happiness" is also a clue that the answer is related to a positive emotion. Laughter is a common expression of joy and happiness, and is often easily recognizable and audible. "Love" and "tears" could also be outward expressions of happiness, but they are not as commonly associated with happiness as laughter. "Spread" and "limp" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When people are constantly buying products, it means that there is a high demand for the manufacturer's goods, which can lead to an economic boom. This is because the company is making more sales and generating more revenue, which can result in increased profits and growth for the business. The other options do not accurately reflect the positive impact that a high demand can have on a manufacturing company.
The sentence suggests that a grant was used to fund the renovation, but it does not mention any specific organization or entity. However, the fact that a fountain was the centerpiece of the renovation and it was located in a public place implies that it was likely funded by a local government or municipality, such as a city government. The other options, such as a state, a casino, or Rome, are less likely to be the correct answer as they do not fit the context of the sentence.
Bottles of glue are typically stored in closed containers to prevent them from drying out or spilling. The art room may be a likely place for glue to be stored, but it would still be kept in a closed container. The garage or kitchen would not be likely places for storing glue, as they are not typically associated with arts and crafts. A cabinet could potentially be used to store glue, but it would still need to be closed to prevent spills or drying out.
Getting hit by a vehicle while crossing the street can result in serious injury or even death, making those two choices the most likely correct answers. "Traffic jam" and "accidents" are not likely results of an individual getting hit by a vehicle, as these terms suggest broader, less direct impacts of the incident. "Fear" is also not a likely result, as fear is a feeling experienced by individuals in response to a situation, rather than an outcome of that situation itself.
The sentence suggests that the police have a specific job that involves not showing any favors. The option "arrest" is the most logical choice because it is a fundamental duty of the police force to enforce the law and make arrests when necessary. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. For example, "board vessels" may be related to coast guard or navy, but it is not related to the context of the sentence.
Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be spread through kissing, which is why someone may avoid it if they are worried about getting infected or if they have an active outbreak of herpes. Arousal and strong feelings may actually make someone more likely to want to kiss, while confusion is not likely to be a factor in this context. Shortness of breath could potentially be a reason someone avoids kissing, but it is not as directly related to the spread of herpes as the infection itself.
The question asks about the potential consequences of judging something wrong, and controversy is a logical answer as it suggests that disagreements and debates may arise from differing opinions on what is right or wrong. Eating cake and going to jail are not relevant responses to the question, and while responsibility and resentment may be potential consequences of judging something wrong, they do not capture the full range of possible outcomes as effectively as controversy.
The question is asking about the emotions that someone is likely to feel on their first day of work. While it's possible that some people might feel panic or stress, it's more common for people to feel excited about the new opportunity. Starting a new job can be an exciting time, and people may feel optimistic about the potential for growth and learning in their new role. The other answer options don't reflect the typical emotional response to starting a new job.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath and is considered a serious offense in the legal system. Therefore, the judge may declare criminal prosecution as an appropriate action against the person who is committing perjury. Mistrial refers to ending a trial prematurely due to an error or problem, and citation refers to a legal notice or summons. Injustices and penalty are not directly related to the action of committing perjury.
The word "loquacious" means someone who talks a lot or talks excessively. The sentence suggests that this man needs to listen more, which means he needs to stop talking and focus on what others are saying. "Pay attention" is the best choice because it implies active listening and engagement with the speaker, whereas "able to hear" and "concentrate" are irrelevant to the context of the sentence. "Shut up" is a rude and unprofessional way of telling someone to stop talking, and is not a suitable option for this situation.
While people may want to read fiction books for a variety of reasons, such as to learn new things or concepts, the most commonly cited reason is to have fun. Fiction books often provide an escape from reality and allow readers to immerse themselves in imaginative worlds and characters, providing entertainment and enjoyment. While some people may read to fall asleep or to memorize information, these are not typically the primary reasons why people choose to read fiction.
When you multiply a positive integer by another positive integer, the resulting number will be orders of magnitude larger than the original number. This is because each additional digit increases the magnitude of the number by a factor of 10. The other options do not involve any mathematical operations that would increase the magnitude of a number, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the shrewd investor had a plan to counteract inflation. Inflation is when the prices of goods and services increase over time, resulting in the decreased purchasing power of money. To fight inflation, one could either increase their income or decrease their expenses. The option "print money" would only worsen inflation, as it increases the money supply and decreases the value of each unit of currency. Lowering the standard of living and paying less are both strategies to decrease expenses, but they do not involve saving money. Saving money is a common strategy to increase one's purchasing power and protect against inflation. "More money" is too vague and does not provide any concrete plan or strategy.
The sentence mentions that the college attended by the students is expensive, which suggests that the cost of attendance is a concern for parents. As paying for expensive education can be a financial burden for families, they are likely to worry about the fees associated with attending such a school. The other options do not directly relate to the context of the sentence, except for dropping out, which could also be a concern for parents. However, it is not specific to attending an expensive school.
The sentence suggests that the girl's feelings towards the boy were evident in her behavior. One common way that people physically show interest or attraction towards someone is by smiling, which is likely why the sentence states that she had a constant smile. The other options (make eye contact, listening, compliment, another person) do not necessarily indicate interest or attraction towards the boy, and therefore are not the correct answer.
The word "stitches" suggests that the doctor was sewing something together, which would be the sides of the cut in this case. "Joining" and "putting together" both have a similar meaning to sewing or stitching. "Paste" could refer to a topical treatment, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Heal" is the ultimate result of the doctor's actions, but it does not describe what the doctor actually did.
The context of the sentence suggests that Luke, like all humans, is mortal and will eventually die. Therefore, the correct answer is "die," as this is the only choice that makes sense in the context of the sentence. The other choices, such as "ocean," "write," "smile," and "think critically," do not have any clear connection to the idea of mortality and self-preservation.
The sentence suggests that in a perfect world, every person would get along. "Perfect world" is a commonly used phrase to describe an ideal society where everything is ideal and everyone is happy. The other options are not related to the concept of a perfect world or getting along with others.
The word "injury" suggests that the question is asking about a harm that comes to a person's body. The word "common" implies that the cause is something that occurs frequently. Accidents are a common cause of injury because they can happen in many different situations, such as car crashes, falls, and sports injuries. The other options do not have the same association with injuries.
The sentence suggests that if someone keeps talking to multiple people about their vegetarianism, there might be negative consequences. "Annoyance" is the most fitting choice since the continuous talking about vegetarianism can become tedious and irritating to others. The other options do not seem to relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cabinets were imported because they were cheap, and that they wouldn't be seen, which implies that they were meant for a storage space rather than a visible area like a kitchen or bathroom. A pantry is a place where people store food and other household items, and it is not a high-traffic area of the house, so it makes sense that someone might choose to install cheaper and less attractive cabinets there. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, either because they are visible areas (kitchen and bathroom) or because they do not make sense in the context (planes and Mexico).
The sentence suggests that the joke made by the comedian was related to bald eagles and a specific treatment that may have caused them to become bald. Chemotherapy is a medical treatment commonly associated with hair loss, which may explain why it was mentioned in the same sentence as the joke about bald eagles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The ignition switch is where the car key is inserted to start the engine and begin driving. The other options, such as pocket, purse, and home, are not relevant to the context of the question and would not be where one would typically place car keys when preparing to drive. The trunk is also an incorrect option as keys are not typically stored in the trunk of a car for driving purposes.
The sentence implies that going outside to skate is a better alternative to doing something else. The other answer choices, such as putting on a helmet or singing, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Falling down" is also not a logical alternative to doing something else, but a potential consequence of skating. Therefore, the correct answer must be "not work so hard," as it is the only opposing option that suggests a different activity that is more enjoyable than working.
The context of the sentence suggests that seeing something dirty underground requires a specific object. The word "underground" is the main clue that points to the correct answer. To see something underground, you would need to look at or into the ground, which is the only option related to the context of the sentence. The other options (bed, bright, clean, and sportsmanlike) are unrelated to the context of the sentence and would not help in seeing something dirty underground.
Train stations often have free magazines or newspapers available for commuters to read while waiting for their train. It is not uncommon for these publications to be provided free of charge as a courtesy to passengers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "chosen what" indicates that the correct answer will be a career or profession that someone actively pursues or chooses for themselves. The use of the word "success" suggests that this career or profession may involve achieving certain goals, milestones, or accomplishments. Out of the given choices, only "vocation" fits this criteria, as it refers to a person's life/career calling or purpose. The other choices are either too specific (new job, awards ceremony) or unrelated (schedule, Michigan) to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the cover was causing some sort of problem or inconvenience for the diners, so they decided to do something about it. The most logical option would be to leave it open or remove it entirely. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "underneath" and "opening" are not actions that can be taken with a cover, "divert suspicion" is irrelevant and doesn't make sense, and "landcover" is not a common term associated with covers in this context.
The sentence suggests that the high rise is located in a central and busy part of a city. The option "downtown" is the most likely answer, as it refers to the commercial and business hub of a city where high-rise buildings are commonly found. The other options are either too specific (e.g., San Francisco, Detroit) or not relevant to the context of a high-rise building.
The context suggests that the forklift would be used in a place where cargo trucks come and go frequently, which is usually at the loading dock of a warehouse or a distribution center. A loading dock is a designated area where goods are loaded and unloaded from trucks, so it is where the forklift would be most useful. The other options such as construction sites or yards may also use forklifts, but they are not as likely to have a high volume of cargo trucks coming and going.
The sentence implies that the passenger is waiting for a ride, which points to the bus depot as the correct answer. A bus depot is a place where buses stop to let passengers on and off, and it is common for people to wait there for their transportation. The other options (shop, work, rack, and newsstand) do not typically involve waiting for a ride, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating lunch too quickly. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be caused by eating too quickly and not chewing food properly. Sickness, low blood sugar, and obesity are not necessarily associated with eating too quickly, and spending money would not be a direct consequence of eating too quickly.
The phrase "If the weather means you..." implies that the weather has a certain effect on the subject being discussed, and the answer choice "get cold" makes logical sense in this context. Animals are often affected by changes in temperature, and if the weather is cold, it makes sense that the animals would also get cold. The other options are not necessarily related to weather or animals.
The word "gossip" implies a casual and social setting where people are talking about personal matters. Sitting at a desk or in an auditorium does not fit this context. A synagogue is a religious place and not necessarily a place for gossip. The ocean is unrelated to the context of the question. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a friend's house, which is a common place for casual conversations and gossip.
The sentence suggests that the speaker filled something with water and plugged it in, which indicates that it is an electronic device. The use of the word "centerpiece" suggests that it is a decorative object that holds a prominent place in the garden. A fountain fits these criteria as it is a water feature that is often used as a decorative centerpiece in gardens. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly associated with gardens or decorative centerpieces.
The question suggests that the answer must be a location or object where a single air conditioner could be found. Therefore, options such as "house", "hard", and "Texas" are not specific enough to provide a clear answer. Additionally, the option "in a bike" is unlikely since bicycles generally do not have air conditioning units. Therefore, the best option is a car, as it is a common location for a single air conditioner unit in order to keep the passengers cool while driving.
The sentence suggests that the product mentioned uses a laser to produce sound. CD players use lasers to read the data stored on a disc and convert it into audio. Physics labs may use lasers for experiments, but this is not specific to sound production. Laboratories, bombs, and hospitals do not typically use lasers for sound production.
The sentence mentions that the music was very dear to the person, which suggests that they were involved in its creation. The phrase "during an important time in his life" implies that the person had a significant personal connection to the music, which further supports the idea that they were the composer. The options of night club and stolen do not fit with the context of the sentence and dreamt and written on paper do not provide enough information to support a correct answer.
The question suggests that the activity of dancing or walking can cause a physical problem on the feet. Fatigue and exhaustion are related to muscle tiredness and overall exhaustion, while humiliation is related to social embarrassment rather than a physical symptom. Skin is too broad of a term, and not specific enough to indicate a foot problem. Blisters, however, are a common problem that can occur on the feet from too much friction or pressure, making them the most likely correct answer.
Literacy refers to the ability to read and write, which is the context of the sentence. While being literate may be associated with intelligence or having access to education (which could be connected with being smart or having paper), the most direct connection to the sentence is that literacy is the ability to read and write. The other options may not be incorrect, but they are not the most precise match for the question.
The first part of the sentence establishes the topic of responsible dog ownership, and the following sentence suggests a way to avoid overpopulation of dogs. The last part of the sentence is describing something else that dogs do, and "go outside" is the option that makes the most sense in this context. Dogs need to go outside for exercise and to relieve themselves, which is a basic aspect of being a responsible pet owner. The other options are either incorrect or not directly related to responsible dog ownership.
The sentence suggests that a friend has taken advantage of you by stealing after cashing in chips at a casino. This would likely lead to feelings of betrayal, as you had trusted your friend but they violated that trust. Resentment and depression are also possible emotional responses, but betrayal is the most likely fit based on the context. "Leave" and "profit" are not relevant options, as they do not reflect the negative impact of being robbed by a friend.
The sentence suggests that people took their seats and read their programs, which is commonly associated with a theater performance. It also mentions that they were expecting to enjoy an entertaining night, which is another clue that points to theater as the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that while toothpaste is commonly found in the bathroom and may be stored in a traveling case or suitcase, it is not meant to be consumed. The context of the sentence implies that the word being sought refers to a part of the body, and the only option that fits that description is "mouth."
The phrase "go round and round" suggests that the weasel is moving in circles around something. In this case, the weasel is waiting to attack, so it is likely circling its prey. Out of the options given, only the mulberry bush is commonly associated with the children's rhyme "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush," which includes the phrase "the monkey chased the weasel." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Airplanes need to gain speed in order to take off, which is why they typically accelerate down the runway during this phase of flight. The other options are not accurate descriptions of what airplanes do during takeoff.
The context of the sentence suggests that Billy joined the military for a specific reason. The phrase "fight for freedom" is commonly associated with military service, as soldiers often go to war to protect their country's freedoms and liberties. The other options do not make sense in this context. For example, getting married is not typically a reason to join the military, and waiting for orders is something that soldiers do after they have already joined.
The phrase "last passing sentence" suggests an end to someone's life. The word "passing" is often used as a euphemism for death, while "last" implies that this sentence is final, indicating that the person has died. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to death or the end of life. "Bounding" could refer to jumping or moving quickly, while "grief" is a feeling of intense sadness, "judgment" refers to decision-making or legal processes, and "appeals" are requests for a decision to be reviewed.
The word "bum" is often used as a derogatory term for someone who is homeless or unemployed. The context of the sentence implies that this person does not have money, and wants to travel without paying. A bridge is a common place for homeless individuals to sleep or stay temporarily, and it is unlikely that there would be any resources available to collect fare for transportation. The other options, such as a bus depot, train station, or even a taxi, would likely require payment for services rendered. The beach also does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "massive" implies that the mountain is very large and imposing in size, which suggests that it would make the nearby hills seem small by comparison. The word "dwarf" means to make seem small or insignificant, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options are all antonyms of massive and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "audience" suggests that the musician is performing in front of a group of people, and the phrase "single musician" suggests that they are performing alone rather than as part of a larger group. The most likely place for this to happen is on a stage, where a performer can stand alone and be the focus of attention for the audience. The other options, such as a studio or orchestra, may involve multiple musicians working together or may not involve a live audience.
The Indian Ocean is located to the east of Africa, so it would make sense that the ocean borders the continent. The other choices do not have a geographical connection to the Indian Ocean.
The sentence suggests that if someone stays in and reads a book all day, they are missing out on something. Since reading a book is a solitary activity, it's likely that the thing they are missing out on is some sort of social or interactive experience. The other options such as learning, education, knowledge, or learning to read are not necessarily mutually exclusive with reading books and therefore don't explain what someone would miss out on if they specifically stay in and read all day.
A fabric store is a place that commonly sells cloth. This is in contrast to the other options, which do not typically have cloth readily available. Egyptian tombs may have preserved clothing made of cloth, but it would not be readily available for purchase or use. The kitchen and bedroom may have items made of cloth, but they are not places where cloth is typically stored or sold. The washing machine is used to clean clothes made of cloth, but it is not a place where cloth is found in abundance.
The sentence suggests that the man had finished a chore (mowing his lawn) and was therefore taking a break to enjoy a refreshing beverage on his porch. The fact that he tells himself something after taking a sip of lemonade indicates that he is taking a moment to reflect on his life. The word "good" is a positive descriptor that conveys a sense of contentment and satisfaction with his life at that moment. The other options ("ending soon," "fleeting," "finite," "important") do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a more negative or uncertain outlook on life.
The sentence implies that broken glass is a common occurrence that usually occurs after a bar closes. Considering the options, parking lots are a typical setting for a bar's customers to park their cars. It is likely that people may accidentally drop bottles or glasses while walking to and from their vehicles. While other options may also have broken glass, they are not as commonly associated with bar closures.
The sentence suggests that the trim is separating two surfaces and the options that could be separated by a line would be a wall and a floor. The other options, such as obesity or sky, do not correlate with the context of the sentence. Similarly, a desk does not necessarily require a trim to divide it from the floor, and the ceiling is usually separated from the floor by a wall rather than a trim.
The question implies that firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is a game that can be played. This game is typically found in arcades as a carnival or circus themed attraction. The other options do not provide any context related to the game's setting, so they are unlikely to be correct answers.
A cemetery is a place where people are buried after they have died. Therefore, it is the most likely option for finding a dead body. The other choices may also relate to death, but they do not necessarily imply the presence of a dead body. A trunk could refer to a suitcase or car trunk, which could be used to transport a body. A funeral is a ceremony held to honor and remember someone who has died, but not necessarily where the body is found. A basement and closet are typically found in houses or buildings and may be used for storage or hiding, but again do not necessarily suggest the presence of a dead body.
The sentence suggests that the guy is choosing to go to bed instead of going to work, indicating a lack of motivation or productivity. This could be explained by laziness, as the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Money" and "making love" do not seem relevant, while "dreaming of" and "falling asleep" suggest unconscious actions rather than a conscious decision to skip work.
Apple trees are commonly associated with growing in valley regions, where the climate is cool and mild with moderate rainfall. This environment provides ample growing conditions for apple trees, which require well-drained soil and good air circulation. The other options, such as Washington State or open fields, do not necessarily indicate a specific area where apple trees are commonly found.
The sentence is talking about creative activities, specifically playing the piano. Inspiration is often a key component in any artistic endeavor, and playing the piano is no exception. While making music and creating musical sounds are important aspects of playing the piano, the sentence is asking for a broader term that encompasses all creative activities. Dancing is not related to playing the piano at all, and "make music" and "making music" are essentially the same answer with different phrasing.
Committing murder is a serious crime that typically results in the perpetrator being sentenced to jail time. While the other options may be associated with murder in some way, such as feeling distress or fear before or after the act, or experiencing problems as a result of their actions, going to jail is the most direct and likely consequence of committing murder.
A heel is a feature commonly found on shoes, as it is a raised part of the sole that provides support and lifts the wearer's heel. It is not typically found on other articles of clothing, such as a loaf of bread or a sock. While boots do often have heels, the question specifically asks about "apparel," which could refer to a wider range of clothing items beyond footwear.
The question is asking for the specific term used to describe the path of the earth around the sun. "Orbit" is the correct answer because it refers specifically to the elliptical path that a celestial body takes around a larger body, such as the earth's path around the sun. "Fotograph," "tree," "solar system," and "attraction" are not related to the earth's motion around the sun, and therefore are not the correct answer.
The question asks about where to put a vase on the wall, which suggests that the vase needs to be elevated and supported. A cabinet or table would not be on the wall, and a windowsill may not be sturdy enough to hold a vase. "Fall off shelf" is not a suitable option. "Shelf" is the most appropriate choice as it provides a surface to hold the vase and is mounted on the wall.
Hollywood is a neighborhood located in Los Angeles, California, known for its association with the American film industry. The other choices do not have any connection to Hollywood or the U.S. coastline. Denmark is a country in Europe, boulevard is a street, country is a general term, and United States is too broad to be considered a specific answer.
Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms create descendants. Humans, like most other animals, reproduce sexually, meaning they produce offspring through the union of male and female reproductive cells. The other choices (regret, drive cars, hear sounds, make mistakes) do not relate to the biological process of reproduction.
The sentence suggests that the robber wanted to hide his pistol, which is something that could easily be done by placing it in a location that is not visible to others. The option "police station" is unlikely because it's a place where guns are kept secure, whereas the robber wants to keep his gun hidden. "War" is also an unlikely option as it doesn't have any clear connection to the sentence. "Police officer's belt" might be a possible answer, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that the robber was near a police officer or had access to their belt. "River" is also unlikely as it would be an inconvenient and ineffective place to hide a gun.
The sentence suggests that James removed some kind of clutter or debris from where he sleeps and placed it elsewhere. The options "attic," "drawer," and "television" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not places where one would typically store junk. "Bed" is a possibility, but since James is throwing the junk away, it is more likely that he is moving it to a separate location, such as a garage, which is often used for storage.
Tabby cats are known for being affectionate and enjoy being close to their owners. Sitting on someone's lap is a common behavior for a tabby cat, especially if they want to get warm and cozy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A table is commonly used for dining and therefore would most likely be placed in a dining room. While a table could be found in other areas such as a living room or kitchen, those spaces are not primarily used for dining purposes. The options "conference" and "demonstration" are not typically associated with a household setting and are unlikely choices.
The sentence suggests that the person was using mouthwash regularly for a specific reason. One common reason for using mouthwash is to promote dental hygiene and achieve white teeth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the desire to get in shape is motivated by a need to address a physical condition - being overweight. While there may be other reasons why someone wants to get in shape, such as wanting to look attractive or feel good, the statement specifically references a physical condition. The other options - sex and bowel movements - are unrelated to the topic of getting in shape.
The use of a tow chain implies that the vehicle is capable of towing something behind it, which rules out options like motorbike and jewelry store. The term "trailer" also suggests a vehicle that is designed for towing, but it is not explicitly stated that a tow chain is used with a trailer. Gear shift does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Therefore, tow truck is the most likely answer.
The phrase "accommodate cumbersome clothing" suggests that the seats were designed for a setting where people might be wearing bulky or formal attire, such as in an auditorium where people might attend performances or ceremonies. The other options, like a bowling alley or beach, do not typically require formal or cumbersome clothing to be worn, making them less likely answers. Additionally, the phrase "space shuttle" is a red herring, including an option that seems unusual or unexpected but not directly relevant to the context of the question.
The phrase "contains many a story" suggests that the answer is a publication that regularly features multiple stories. While books, magazines, and novels can contain multiple stories, they are typically not black and white. Story books may be black and white, but they are not typically associated with containing multiple stories on a regular basis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is newspaper, which is traditionally black and white and contains a variety of news stories.
The actions described in the sentence (jumping up and down, screaming loudly, banging their heads) suggest a high-energy and exciting environment, which is commonly associated with concerts. The other options do not fit this context - "water" is too vague, "in class" and "meeting" are unlikely to involve such behavior, and the "mall" is an unusual place for people to act this way.
Dams are typically built across rivers or other bodies of water to create a large reservoir that can be used to generate electricity. Water enters the dam through an intake valve or gate and flows into a penstock, which is a large pipe that carries the water to the power turbine. The force of the water in the penstock turns the blades of the turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Wet clothes, cracks, thin soup, and dribble are not related to the process of generating electricity in a dam.
The sentence suggests that the person in question was involved in a battle and felt a strong emotion that influenced their actions. Anger is commonly associated with aggression and a desire to harm others, which may explain why the person was driven to destroy their enemy. The other options do not make sense in the context of a battle where anger is present.
When something is broken, it is typically not working as it should, indicating that there is a problem. Therefore, someone who is trying to find an answer for a situation where something is broken is likely looking for a way to fix the problem. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of something being broken.
The question is asking about differences between people living in different parts of the world, so we can assume the answer is related to geographical or cultural differences. The first option, countries, is the most likely answer as it refers to the different nations or states that make up the world and the unique characteristics of their people. The other options - space, universe, thought, and obesity - do not have a direct connection to the question's context.
The sentence suggests that Billy likes seeing new teachers because he enjoys meeting new people. However, it also implies that Billy doesn't care about the quality of his education, as this is not mentioned in the sentence. The other options, such as excitement or envy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "University of Chicago" is not relevant to the sentence, since it is not mentioned whether Billy attends or aspires to attend this institution.
This question is asking for a verb that can only be applied to a door and not to a jar. The answer is "locked" because you can lock a door using a key, padlock, or other devices, but you can't lock a jar as it typically does not have a locking mechanism. The other options, such as "closed" or "opened," are applicable to both doors and jars.
The sentence mentions that Billy is a student taking a course, which implies that he is enrolled in an educational institution. The other options (every aspect of life, library, in a movie hall, classroom) do not necessarily suggest an academic setting. The option "university" is the most likely answer as it is a common place for students to take courses in communications.
Tearooms are typically associated with British culture, and London is a well-known city in England that is famous for its tea culture. Many tearooms can be found in London, offering a variety of tea blends and tea-based products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is frustrated with driving to work, specifically with traffic. The use of the word "chore" implies that it is something she does not enjoy, and the mention of traffic hints at a potential cause of her frustration. The word "impatience" fits into this context as it is a common feeling associated with waiting in traffic. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not closely related to the situation described in the sentence.

The sentence suggests that Danny spent all day at the museum looking at exhibits, indicating that he was on his feet for an extended period. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he studied the exhibits carefully, indicating that he was likely moving around and engaging with the exhibits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he might have gone home due to tiredness in his feet from standing and walking all day. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the astronaut was enjoying the sensation of breathing fresh air after being in space, which would likely lead to the ability to breathe deeply. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence or do not accurately reflect the experience of the astronaut.
The sentence suggests that Lance was likely in a natural setting, since he spotted a beaver in a river. The most logical option from the choices would be countryside, which is typically associated with natural landscapes and wildlife. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where you could find out more information about a type of lizard, which suggests you need to look for a source of information. The options "garden floor," "rocks," "bushes," and "garden" do not provide any clear sources of information, while "books" is a commonly used source for research and learning. Additionally, books may contain detailed descriptions of different types of lizards, including their habitat, behavior, and physical characteristics.
The sentence suggests that a person is using their whole body for work, which can often result in lower back pain due to strain and exertion on the spine. The other options, such as making mistakes or having big muscles, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Sore muscles could be a possible symptom, but lower back pain is a more specific and likely one in this case.
The sentence suggests that a doctor would "rush" somewhere, which implies that there is an urgent need for medical attention. The only choice that reflects an urgent medical situation is the emergency room. A nursing home typically has patients who require long-term care, and while a dentist may be necessary for some urgent dental situations, it is not likely that a doctor would rush to a dental office. The same applies to sick patients in general. The golf course is not related to any medical event.
Razors are commonly used for shaving, which is a service provided by barbers in traditional barber shops. The other options do not relate to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person observed their wife being unfaithful but is choosing to ignore it or pretend it never happened. This is an example of self-deception or denial. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the contestant's design idea caught the attention of the judges because it was smart, which implies that the contestant was intelligent. The word "smart" generally refers to something that is clever or well thought out, which is a characteristic often associated with intelligence. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. "Garish" means excessively bright or flashy, which is unlikely to have impressed the judges. "Ignorant" and "backward" are negative terms that suggest a lack of knowledge or understanding, which would not have been a positive characteristic in a design competition.

The sentence suggests that the person is using one specific star to help them locate other objects in the sky. This is a characteristic commonly associated with constellations, which are groups of stars that are named and recognized based on their patterns in the sky. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man was trying to improve his appearance in order to attract women. The goal of grooming is often to enhance one's appearance by being neat, clean, and well-dressed. The options "tardiness" and "late" have no relevance to the context, while "bathe" is a basic hygiene practice and doesn't necessarily imply an effort to look more attractive. "Neatness" is a possibility, but "looking good" is a more direct and accurate answer given the context of attracting women.
The use of the word "clerk" implies that the sign was posted in a commercial setting, rather than a hallway or toilet. Additionally, the fact that the sign was made of paper suggests that it was not intended to be a permanent fixture, so it is likely that the clerk put it in a location with high visibility to draw attention to a sale or promotion. The options "public place" and "hallway" are too general to suggest a specific location, while "toilet" is unlikely for a promotional sign. Therefore, "store window" is the most logical choice.
The sentence suggests that the pet in question is capable of scratching and has fur. This would eliminate options like bird or rug that do not fit the context. The bare spot beneath the whiskers implies that the pet is a mammal with hair or fur growing in that area. Given that the fleas caused the scratching, the pet is likely either a cat or a dog. However, cats do not typically have whiskers below their noses, so dog would be the correct answer. Carpet is an unlikely option since it does not have any relevance to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is something that cats have, but humans and some other animals do not have. Since all options except for "tongues" are body parts or features that all animals possess, it can be inferred that the correct answer is related to a specific characteristic of a cat's tongue, such as its rough texture or ability to taste certain flavors that other animals cannot.
An anemone is a marine creature that lives in the sea, so it is most likely to be found in the sea water. Additionally, the phrase "warm water" suggests that the anemone may not be found in colder waters like the Atlantic or South Pacific, which eliminates those options. Florists and nurseries are places where plants are grown and sold, so they have no connection to the question.
The sentence suggests that the characters in the sentence were looking for relief from the heat, which is commonly associated with the goal of cooling down. Eating ice cream is a common way to cool down on a hot day, as the cold temperature of the treat can help to lower body temperature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Divorce is the legal process of ending a marriage, so the institution being dissolved in a divorce is the marriage itself. The other choices either do not accurately describe the situation or are not directly related to the legal process of divorce.
The sentence suggests that George is interested in hunting foxes. Virginia is known to be a popular destination for fox hunting due to its large population of foxes and fox hunting culture. The other options, such as hen house and lion's den, do not have any connection to fox hunting, and painting is not an activity that involves live animals. California may also have foxes, but it is not commonly known as a destination for fox hunting.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking for something to read while waiting at the doctor's office. The most likely option from the choices provided would be a magazine article, as these are often found in waiting rooms and cover a variety of topics that can be read quickly. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence, as a safe deposit box, hotel menu book, and library are not things that one typically finds in a doctor's office, and the word "book" is too general and could refer to anything.
The sentence describes a common practice when eating a meal, which is to place a cup on a surface. The most likely surface for this action is a table, which is used for dining and typically has enough space to accommodate a cup. The other options do not make sense in this context - a dishwasher is used for cleaning dishes, a shelf is usually elevated and not a good surface for placing cups, a coaster is specifically designed for cups but may not always be available, and a closet is not a surface for placing cups at all.
The sentence suggests that Bo was not doing anything wrong and that the police did not have a reason to arrest him. The fact that they thought he was just "home" implies that he was not out causing trouble or breaking any laws. The other choices, such as "donut shop" or "direct traffic," do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not indicate innocence or lack of criminal activity.
Ironing clothes is a common practice to remove wrinkles and creases that may have formed during washing, drying, or storage. The heat and pressure from the iron help to smooth out the fabric and give it a crisp appearance. Sanitation is not a primary reason for using an iron, although ironing can help to kill bacteria and freshen up clothes. "Attractive appearance" and "looks good" are essentially the same as removing wrinkles. "Ruined" is the opposite of the intended result.
A safe is a secure container typically used to store valuable items such as cash, jewelry, and important documents. It is designed to be difficult to break into or steal from, and often has a lock or combination to provide added security. The other options do not typically have locks and are not commonly associated with storing valuables in the same way that a safe is.
A teakettle is commonly used for boiling water, which is an essential step in preparing tea. While tea would also be an acceptable answer, water is the more general and basic answer that would fit any situation where a teakettle is being used. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the question.
The word "astray" suggests that the dishes are not in their proper place or are dirty, which would require someone to clean them. The only option that directly relates to cleaning dishes is washing dishes, while the other choices do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "all kinds" suggests that the answer is not limited to one specific source of knowledge. Encyclopedias and books are commonly associated with a wide variety of information, but knowledge can also be gained through personal experiences and interactions with others, as in a class. Newspapers may provide current events and specific pieces of knowledge, but can also contain a diverse range of topics and perspectives. Therefore, all of the options listed could be valid sources of knowledge.
The sentence suggests that the dream was unpleasant or frightening, which would make the dreamer want to wake up and escape from the dream. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not relate to the dream being terrible or the dreamer wanting to escape from it.
The sentence implies that the library was seeking to increase community engagement, and one way they did this was by screening a particular type of film. The options "monitor" and "homes" do not make sense in this context, while "drive in movie" and "theatre" are more specific locations for screening movies. "Movies" is the most general option and fits best with the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the food needs to be carried along on a long walk, and the most common way to do so would be in a backpack or a similar bag. The other options, such as a table or a jar, do not make sense in this context as they are not practical for carrying food on a long walk in the countryside. A box or a container may work, but a backpack is generally the most convenient and popular choice.
The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a specific item in a larger shopping area, which is commonly found in shopping malls. Clothing stores, thrift stores, and laundromats are not typically found in a shopping mall and would not require hours of browsing. A shopping plaza could be a possibility, but the term "shopping mall" is more commonly used to describe a large indoor shopping area with multiple stores.
The word "thoroughfare" suggests that James was driving on a main road or street. The options "country" and "town" do not fit with this context, as they suggest a more rural or small community setting. "Traffic" is also unlikely to be the correct answer, as it is just a general term for the volume of vehicles on a road, whereas the question is asking about James' home surroundings. "House" is not a good fit either, as it doesn't provide any information about the location or setting of James' drive. Therefore, "city" is the most likely answer.
Perishable food needs to be kept at a low temperature to extend its shelf life. The only option that provides a low temperature is the freezer, making it the correct answer. The other options either do not provide a low temperature or are not suitable for storing food.
When someone rents a room, it is typically in a hotel or other lodging establishment, where the passageway to the room would be located within the building. The other options - cave, jungle, maze, and freeway - are not relevant to the context of the question as they do not typically involve renting a room with a passageway.
A canoe is a type of boat that is typically used for recreational activities on bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it is logical to store a canoe in a place that is specifically designed for boats, such as a boat house. The other options, such as a mountain stream or campground, may be places where a canoe could be used, but they are not necessarily places where one would store a canoe. A garage may be an alternative option, but it is less common than a boat house for storing boats.
The question is asking about the emotional state you might experience when meeting a friend whose company you greatly enjoy. Joy is a positive emotion commonly associated with feelings of happiness and pleasure. The other options may also be associated with meeting a friend, but do not necessarily capture the specific emotional response suggested in the question. Talking, relaxation, excitement, and fun could all be present in a positive social encounter, but do not necessarily capture the emotional response.
Helicopter tours are often associated with aerial views of natural landmarks or sites of natural beauty. The mention of a bald eagle in the sentence also suggests that the landmark being referred to is likely to be a place where bald eagles are commonly found. Out of the given options, the Grand Canyon is a well-known natural landmark that is often visited by tourists on helicopter tours. Additionally, bald eagles are known to inhabit the area around the Grand Canyon, making it the most likely option among the choices provided. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence's context.
The question is asking for a location where shoes should not be placed. The options include walking, which is an activity rather than a location, and closet and suitcase, which are both common places to store shoes. The options of table and bed are both flat surfaces where shoes could easily be placed, but it is generally considered inappropriate to put shoes on either of these surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is table.
The sentence suggests that the professor began to preach during the lecture and the other students reacted in a way that the speaker found odd. Applauding is a possible reaction to a speaker who is perceived as inspiring or motivating, so it makes sense that the students started to applaud. Laughing or taking notes would not necessarily be an unusual response, and falling asleep would not be a reaction to a professor becoming preachy. Learning is also not considered an unusual reaction to attending a lecture.
The sentence implies that committing perjury is a serious offense that carries significant consequences, such as a high risk of punishment or penalty. The other options (arrest, shame, tension) may also be associated with committing perjury, but they do not fully capture the severity of the situation described.
Housework is typically done to maintain a clean and organized living space. Allergies may also be a reason to clean, but it wouldn't necessarily be the main focus of the question. Joy or exhaustion may not be the primary motivation for doing housework, and boredom isn't necessarily a reason to clean, as there are many other things one could do to alleviate boredom.
A catwalk typically refers to a narrow elevated platform used for walking, which is commonly found in theaters or on airplanes for crew members. New York City is a possible location for a catwalk, but it is not specific enough to determine its likelihood. A fieldhouse, on the other hand, is more likely to be an indoor sports facility with a large open space, making it an unlikely location for a catwalk. Therefore, the correct answer is fieldhouse.
The sentence implies that the location being referred to is known for strong storms that originate from the ocean. The tropics are known for experiencing powerful storms and hurricanes due to warm ocean waters and other atmospheric conditions, which makes this the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Sugar is typically stored in cupboards or pantries in homes and kitchens, as it is a common ingredient used in cooking and baking. Coffee, bank lockers, and candy bars do not typically serve as storage locations for household sugar. "Every home" is too broad and vague to be a specific answer to this question, as sugar may be stored in a variety of places within a home.
Bald eagles are native to North America and are commonly found in areas with large bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines. Colorado is a state located in the western United States that has many bodies of water and is within the range of the bald eagle's habitat. The other choices do not provide any relevant information about where bald eagles live.
A vertical surface typically refers to a surface that stands upright, like a wall. Pictures are commonly displayed on walls using nails, hooks, or other hanging devices. The other options- shelf, desktop, editer, and art show- do not necessarily refer to vertical surfaces where pictures would commonly be displayed.
The sentence implies that falling in front of people while going to a public store may cause a person to feel a certain way. The word "felt" is in the past tense, suggesting that the person has already experienced this. The word "embarrassment" is the best answer because falling in front of people can be a humiliating experience that may make a person feel self-conscious or awkward. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotions that a person in this situation would feel.
Washington D.C. is the capital of the United States and where the United States government is located. This includes the White House, Congress, and various government agencies. Therefore, it is the most likely choice for the city where most U.S. politicians work. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
The question asks what could happen if someone threatens to charge you with obstructing justice, not what the actual consequences would be if you were charged with obstructing justice. Therefore, none of the options involve actual legal consequences such as being fined or going to jail. However, being threatened can certainly cause fear or anxiety, which is the closest option to the question being asked.
The sentence suggests that the man left his car outside when he got home from work. The options "exit ramp" and "repair shop" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they relate to locations outside of the man's home. "Front yard" is a possibility, but "driveway" is a more specific and likely answer since it is a common area to leave a car parked outside of one's home. "Garage" could also be a possibility but the sentence implies that the car was not put away in the garage.
The question is about where a student might store a pencil while traveling, which suggests that the answer should be a portable, convenient option. A backpack is a common choice for students to carry their school supplies in, especially when traveling or on the go. The other options, such as desktop or desk drawer, are stationary and not suitable for traveling. Pocket may be an option, but it depends on the size of the pencil and the type of clothing being worn, which adds uncertainty to the answer.
The sentence suggests that the situation involves multiple people speaking over speakers, which is a common setup for a conference call. A conference call is a type of phone call that allows multiple participants to join in from different locations. The other options, such as desktop or headphones, don't necessarily have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Going on vacation typically involves leaving one's home and traveling to another location. Before doing so, a person would need to make sure they have enough food to sustain themselves during their trip or to have food waiting for them upon their return. Resting or lying in bed are not necessarily specific actions taken before vacation and crossing the street or watering plants are unrelated.
Leather horseback riding equipment, such as saddles, bridles, and boots, are typically found at stables or equestrian supply stores. They are used specifically in the context of horseback riding, so options like car seats or handbags do not make sense. Department stores may have some equestrian equipment, but it would likely be limited in selection. Merry go rounds also have no connection to horseback riding equipment.
The other options do not provide a compelling reason for why someone would want to keep working. Frustration and boredom would typically lead someone to want to stop working, while being paid and blisters are simply consequences of work rather than reasons for continuing it. Making money, on the other hand, is a clear motivation for many people to continue working, as it allows them to meet their financial needs and achieve their personal goals.
The question is asking where to put a letter if someone wants to pay a bill from their house. The most common way to pay a bill by mail would be to put the payment in an envelope and address it to the company that bills for the service. The other options may be related to organizing or storing documents, but they are not specific to paying bills or sending mail.
The sentence suggests that Bill likes to do creative things on rainy days and that he loves to taste things. Making bread is a creative activity that involves tasting and experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. The other options (enjoy film, go to the gym, stay in bed, write) do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence, so they are less likely to be correct.
The sentence implies that the person had a negative experience at work, which may lead to feelings of stress or anxiety upon returning. The other options do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
The correct answer should be the next logical step in the sequence. After flushing the toilet and washing your hands, the next step would be to dry your hands. None of the other options make sense in the context of the sequence.
The sentence suggests that the person deposited a check, which is a common action taken when trying to save money or add to one's bank account. The option "bank savings" is the most relevant and logical choice based on the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the cafe has both indoor and outdoor seating options. The term "building" makes the most sense in this context as it refers to a physical structure where the cafe is located. The other choices are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information.
Literature refers to written works that have artistic or intellectual value, including books, poems, plays, and essays. Newspapers may contain written works, but they are considered more of a source of news and information rather than literature. "Own home" and "good homes" do not make sense as options as they are not related to literature. A public library may contain literature, but it is not necessarily a type of literature itself. "Books and magazines" is the best answer as it directly refers to written works that are a part of literature.
The sentence suggests that there is some discrepancy between how the place feels and what someone higher up has said. This implies that there is some uncertainty or confusion about the correct location. The other options do not make sense in this context - a job, map, line, or almost anywhere would not create the same sense of uncertainty or conflict.
The sentence suggests that the subject of the sentence engaged in excessive celebration, which often resulted in some negative consequences. One of the most common results of excessive drinking is drunkenness, which can cause impaired judgement, loss of control, and other negative effects. The other options may be associated with celebration as well, but they do not specifically relate to the negative consequences mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person loaded up their plate with food and is now looking for something to wash it down with. Based on this context, the most likely item he would look for is a cup, as this is the common container for beverages. The other options do not make sense in this specific context.
A picture of a thermometer would most likely be taken with a camera, as opposed to being found in a cabinet, drawer, doctor's office, or hospital. A camera is a tool used to capture visual images, making it the most likely option for taking a picture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James is experiencing unexpected episodes of unconsciousness, which is a common symptom of a concussion. Additionally, the sentence states that he is also suffering from something else. The word "annoying" implies that whatever he is experiencing is more of an inconvenience than a serious medical issue. The option "coma" and "death" are both extreme and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Falling down" and "pain" could be related to a concussion, but they do not fit with the idea of him losing consciousness at annoying times. "Forgetfulness" is a common symptom of a concussion and fits well with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the answer is a place where a large number of sand grains can be found. Beaches are commonly associated with sand, as they are often made up of large quantities of it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a computer has stopped working, which is commonly referred to as a "crash". The other options do not accurately describe the situation of a computer not working. "Do work" and "help people" are too general and don't specifically relate to computers. "Compute" is a verb that describes what a computer does, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working. "Networked" describes a type of computer connection, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working.
The sentence implies that the speaker needs to store old items in a place where they will not get damp, which suggests a dry and elevated location. A common place for this type of storage is an attic, which is typically a dry and insulated space located above the main living areas of a house. The other options are unlikely choices for storing old items, as a waste bin would not be suitable for preserving items or protecting them from dampness, a cellar may be too damp, a fridge is too small and not used for storage of non-food items, and a museum would not be accessible for personal use.
The sentence mentions leaves falling each year and how a natural compost keeps the soil healthy for trees, indicating that it's referring to a natural environment where trees grow. Out of the given options, a forest would be the most likely setting for this type of ecosystem. The other options, such as a garden or orchard, may also benefit from a natural compost, but they do not necessarily have the same abundance of trees as a forest.
The sentence suggests that the child is staying somewhere overnight and needs a place to keep their towel. The most likely option is at a hotel, where towels are often provided for guests and can be kept in the room. The other options do not make as much sense in this context – a backpack or shelf may be used to store personal items, but not a towel specifically, while a linen closet would not be accessible to a child staying at a hotel. The swimming pool option also does not make sense, as a child would not need to bring their own towel to a swimming pool.
The sentence suggests that people are advocating for the protection of fetuses, which is commonly associated with the anti-abortion movement. The phrase "Choose Life" is a common slogan used by the movement to promote their message. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
During official judging, it is important to avoid controversy because controversy can undermine the credibility of the judging process and suggest that a decision was not made fairly. Prejudice is another thing that should be avoided during judging because it suggests bias and unfairness toward a particular group. Verdict refers to the final decision made by a judge, which is not something that should be avoided during the actual judging process. Statement and evaluating are also not things that should be avoided but rather important parts of the judging process.
The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was not socially acceptable, as she was yelling obscenities in public. Therefore, her husband is likely to feel embarrassed by her actions, as they reflect on both her and him as a couple. The word "entertaining" implies that others found the situation amusing, but it does not provide any information about the husband's feelings. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to finding a telephone. The only option that has a clear association with telephones is "office." Offices typically have landline telephones as a means of communication for employees. The other options do not have any relevance to telephones.
The sentence explicitly states that a student should not do something while their instructor is lecturing. Out of the given choices, talking on their phone is the only option that goes against basic classroom etiquette and disrupts the learning environment. The other options may be acceptable or even encouraged during lecture, such as studying engineering or reading a book.
A party is generally a social event, and people usually attend parties to have fun and enjoy themselves with others. The other options do not make sense in the context of attending a party. "To be alone" contradicts the purpose of a party, which is to socialize, and "believe in god" is not necessarily related to attending a party. "Face each other" and "group together" are vague and do not provide a clear reason for attending a party.
The sentence implies that there is a particular place where plants can always be grown. The option "surface of earth" is the most likely correct answer since plants grow naturally in the soil and need sunlight and water to survive, which are all found on the earth's surface. The other options may be suitable for growing plants, but they are not always available or appropriate in every situation.
The word "zoned" implies that there are regulations or restrictions on the type of building that can be constructed on a certain piece of land. In this case, James cannot build his concert hall because his land is not zoned for commercial buildings. The other options - theater, orchestras, city, and university building - doesn't have a direct connection to commercial building regulations.
When someone is going to watch their favorite sports team play, the main objective is to enjoy the experience regardless of whether the team wins or loses. Therefore, the most common thing someone will tell you when you let them know that you are going to watch your favorite team play is to have fun. The other options may also be appropriate, but they do not capture the essence of the experience as effectively as "have fun."
The sentence implies that the priority is moving cargo at a low price, which suggests that the most affordable option would be the best choice. Boats are often used for transporting cargo as they are generally cheaper to operate than airplanes or trains, especially for large quantities of goods. Ships' holds are simply a part of a ship and cannot be used as a mode of transport. The other answer choices are either more expensive to use or prioritize speed over affordability.
Hitting the side of a horse can cause it to move or start walking or running. This is a common method of communication between riders and horses, where a light tap or kick on the side of the horse can signal the horse to move in a particular direction or pick up pace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of hitting the side of a horse.
The sentence states that the jury determined the accused to be guilty of a crime. In the legal system, it is the role of the judge to pass judgement and decide an appropriate sentence for the convicted individual. Therefore, the correct answer is "pass sentence." The other options do not align with the context of the sentence and are unlikely outcomes for the situation presented.
The sentence suggests that James was at a lunch table and was trying to leave it. The phrase "arise from the lunch table" implies that James was seated at the table, which eliminates the options of falling down or lying down. The phrase "had done what" suggests that James was engaged in some activity while at the table, which makes the option "sitting down" most likely. The option "go ahead" is unlikely as it does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Writing a letter typically requires having something to write on, such as paper or a digital screen, as well as the ability to read and write, known as being literate. Not giving up, moving fingers, and keeping warm are not necessary components of writing a letter and are not relevant to the context of the question.
A library is a place specifically dedicated to housing a large collection of books and other written materials. It is designed for people to read, study and research, therefore it is likely that someone could find a huge amount of text in a library. The other options do not have the same kind of association with large quantities of text, such as a newspaper being limited to a single issue or a writer's brain being limited by their own capacity to create.
The term "nerdy" often refers to someone who is very interested in academic or intellectual pursuits such as science or technology. "Star Trek" is a popular science fiction franchise that typically appeals to individuals with an interest in these subjects. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "civic meeting" suggests that the meeting is open to the public and therefore, the paper sign advertising the meeting should be posted in a public place where it can be easily seen by individuals passing by. The other options may not be as visible to the general public or may not be appropriate for posting public notices.
The sentence suggests that the crab had a reaction to something it saw in the kitchen, and that something was most likely a threat to the crab's safety. Out of the options given, a huge knife is the most likely threat that would cause a crab to react in fear. Boiling water and cold water are unlikely to cause a visible reaction in the crab, while the Pacific Ocean and fish market are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence does not provide sufficient information to determine where the person taking the call is likely to be. It only states that they are away from work. The choices may all be possible depending on the context of the situation, so without more information, it is impossible to choose a correct answer.
The question is asking for the emotional response or outcome of sex. Bliss is a word commonly used to describe a state of extreme happiness or joy, which could be associated with the feeling of intimacy and connection during sex. Orgasm is the physical and emotional climax of sexual activity, and is widely regarded as a positive and pleasurable experience. The other options are either negative (aids, getting pregnant) or unrelated (educations) to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where one can pay for food, which rules out options like backyard, texas, and louisiana. The mention of bbq and paying for it indicates that it is likely a restaurant that serves this type of cuisine. Ribs is a type of bbq, but it does not answer the question of where you are located. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant.
Natural landmarks are typically preserved in national parks, which are designated areas set aside for the purpose of conserving natural resources and protecting unique features. The other options do not necessarily have the same conservation goals as national parks, and may not prioritize the protection of natural landmarks in the same way.
The sentence implies that the person is referring to a specific program that they want to watch on television, which makes "see favorite show" the most logical answer. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Lying is often seen as a breach of trust, and it can lead to a breakdown in communication and a lack of trust in the person who lied. This is especially true when trying to find accurate information, as lying can lead to confusion and make it difficult to discern the truth. Hurt feelings and unhappiness may also result from lying, but they are not necessarily related to the process of finding accurate information. "Good things" is too broad and does not align with the negative connotations associated with lying in the question.
Rest is commonly associated with the relief of fatigue and exhaustion. After resting, it's typical to feel rejuvenated and more energized, which suggests that the correct answer is "feel better." The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that killing people is not a desirable or acceptable behavior, which is reflected in the word "terrible." Going to jail is a consequence of committing a crime, but it does not reflect the moral or ethical position on the act itself. Joy would not be an appropriate association with killing people, as most people would not feel happy or joyful about taking someone else's life. Mistake implies that the act was unintentional, which may not be the case in this context. Murder is a synonym for killing, but it carries additional legal and moral connotations that may not apply universally.
The sentence implies that violence is common in sports, but Danny does not participate in any sport. Therefore, the violence he engages in must be in a different context. The only option that fits this context is warfare, which is a known context for violence. The other options are either redundant or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the consequence of walking too much with poorly fitting shoes will be mentioned. Since poorly fitting shoes can rub against the skin and cause irritation, blisters are a common result of this. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "washing clothes over and over many times" suggests repetitive use or action, which can lead to wear and tear on the clothes. Clothes that are washed too often or too vigorously can lose their shape, fade, or become thin and fragile. "Transmutate," "torn," and "get wet" are not related to the context of washing clothes, while "wet clothes" is redundant and doesn't provide an answer to the question.
The sentence describes a type of performance on TV that aims to promote the purchase of a certain product. This type of performance is commonly known as a commercial, which is a televised advertisement. The other options, such as newspaper or theatre, do not involve TV, while show and movie may promote a product indirectly, but not necessarily through a performance by actors.
The word "connection" implies that this question is referring to a layover or transfer, where a traveler switches from one flight to another. Such transfers typically occur at airports, which have designated terminals, gates, and shuttle services for connecting flights. The other options listed have no relevance to air travel or transportation.
The question is asking about the human body part that is used for speaking. The most obvious answer is the mouth as it is the primary tool for producing speech sounds. The other options (one hand, two ears, brains, two legs) do not have a direct connection to the act of speaking.
The question is asking what you need to afford a vacation, so the correct answer would be having money to spend on the trip. Selling your house is not necessary for a vacation, saving money is a way to obtain the necessary funds, packing is not related to financial ability, and vacating is not a valid term in this context.
The phrase "one of every kind" suggests that the person has gathered a complete set of something, which is commonly referred to as a collection. The other options do not make sense in the context of having one of every kind of something. "Have to hold" and "procrastinate" are verbs that don't fit the sentence structure, "hobby" is a noun that could potentially fit but doesn't accurately describe the person's possession, and "acknowledgment" is a completely unrelated concept.
The sentence mentions that the jaw skeleton of a shark was on display for children to walk through, making it likely that this is an attraction at a place where marine animals are displayed or studied. The option "marine museum" is the only choice that fits this context, while the other choices have no clear connection to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was unable to concentrate on playing a game with friends due to some kind of obstacle or distraction, and that they wished they could be doing something else with it instead. The word "enjoying" fits this context because it suggests that the person would rather be having fun playing the game with their friends instead of struggling to concentrate. The other options ("gaming," "anger," "stress," and "injury") do not fit this context as well, and do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
A whoopee cushion is a practical joke item that makes a fart noise when someone sits on it. Therefore, the correct answer is flatulence, as it is the sound that is commonly associated with a whoopee cushion. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone sitting on a whoopee cushion.
The word "landing" suggests that the traveler is on a mode of transportation that is capable of landing, such as an airplane. Additionally, the use of the word "convenience" implies that the traveler is referring to a transportation hub such as an airport, where there are many options for connecting flights or ground transportation. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not involve modes of transportation that "land".
The context suggests that the man is looking for a visual representation of the United States, implying that he wants to see it on a map. An atlas is a book of maps, but a map specifically shows the geography of a particular region. The other options (history book, tv channels, northern hemisphere) do not relate to the subject matter of finding the United States on a visual.
The word "together" suggests that the families are looking for a place where they can gather and spend time with each other. A funeral would not be an appropriate place to decide on dinner together, as it is a somber event. Similarly, a wedding may not be suitable if the families are not closely related or if they are not attending the same wedding. A supermarket and a hotel are also not typically places where families would gather to decide on dinner. However, a park is a common location for families to enjoy outdoor activities and have picnics, which could include discussing where to go for dinner.
The sentence suggests that the person was afraid of burglars who might be violent or have the potential to be violent. In this context, 'arming oneself' means preparing oneself with tools or weapons to defend oneself in case of an attack. The other options do not make sense in the context of someone who fears violent burglars.
The question suggests that there is a way to avoid getting bitten by a dog. Playing dead is a common survival strategy when confronted with a potential threat, and may help to prevent a dog from attacking if it believes the threat is no longer present. The other options, such as being a cat or being black, do not provide any clear solution to the problem of avoiding getting bitten by a dog.
The question is asking for a good way to break boredom for kids. Out of the given choices, "play games" would be the most effective as it allows children to engage in a variety of activities that may cater to their interests and provide entertainment. Chess, basket, and cards require a specific skill set and may not be suitable for all children, while watching a film is a more passive activity that may not keep their attention for very long.
Apple trees require temperate climates with distinct seasons and a certain number of chilling hours to produce fruit. Rainforests are typically hot and humid all year round and do not experience distinct seasons, making them unsuitable for growing apple trees. The other options are possible places to find apple trees as they have suitable climates and environments.
The sentence mentions a pastor zoning a graveyard, which suggests that the graveyard is located on or near church property. The phrase "church grounds" is the only option that directly relates to this context, while the other choices are less likely to be associated with a church or religious setting.
Hells Canyon is a region located on the border of Nevada and Oregon known for its scenic waterways and wildlife, including bald eagles. The sentence suggests that the person was staying at a resort near this area and left on their boat from a dock in the north, where they spotted a bald eagle at the opposite end. The other options are not located in the same geographic region as Nevada and California or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jamie had to leave work because of low serotonin levels, which is commonly associated with depression. Depression can cause fatigue, lethargy and low energy levels, which fits with the description of Jamie's condition. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person has a valuable writing instrument and wants to keep it safe. One common place to store valuable items in an office is a desk drawer. The other options are less likely because they either do not provide a secure location (such as a writer's hand, pocket, or classroom) or involve getting rid of the item altogether (such as a pawn shop).
The sentence states that modesty is an important virtue, and suggests that an insufficient amount of it in the face of individuals of greater station may be interpreted as something negative. This would likely be interpreted as immodesty, as the opposite of modesty is generally considered to be immodesty. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is referencing a specific type of store that sells sports equipment, tools, and lawn mowers. A sporting goods store is a retail store that specializes in selling sports equipment and accessories for a variety of sports. Sears is a department store that may sell sporting goods, but it does not specialize in them. Schools and museums would not typically sell sports equipment or lawn mowers. A sporting event is an activity or competition, not a place to buy goods.
The sentence suggests that the purpose of going to the market is to buy things. The other options are related to the process of going to the market, but do not indicate the main objective of the trip. "Arriving at destination" is too general and could apply to any kind of journey, while "impulse buying" and "carrying bags" are only incidental aspects of shopping. "Pushing a cart" is also a necessary part of the shopping experience, but does not indicate the ultimate goal of the trip.
The sentence suggests that the person listening to the quiet music began to snore and close their eyes, indicating that they may have fallen asleep. Quiet music is often associated with relaxation and calm, which could have contributed to the person's drowsiness. Deafness and resting do not have clear connections to the context of the sentence, while relaxation and calm are similar in meaning to fall asleep but do not explain why the person started snoring.
The phrase "wished upon" suggests that the token has some kind of superstitious or magical significance. The options "coin collection," "loans," and "ashtray" do not fit this context, as they are not associated with wishing. "Pocket" could be a possibility, but it doesn't explain why the token is being desperately wished upon. "Slot machine," however, is a common object for people to make wishes on by giving it a "lucky" coin or token before playing, making it the most likely choice.
The sentence indicates that the person was curious and wanted to leave their small hometown, which implies a desire to explore and experience new things. The phrase "go somewhere" is the only option that fits this context, as the other options do not relate to travel or exploration. "Analyse," "die," and "read book" are all too specific or unrelated, while "see favorite show" may imply a desire to escape one's current location, but does not necessarily suggest a sense of curiosity or exploration.
The choices all relate to the concept of having fun, but only "enjoy yourself" captures the general positive feeling associated with having fun. "Have sex" is a specific type of activity that some people may enjoy for fun, but it does not encompass the full range of activities that people do for fun. "Waste time" has a negative connotation and suggests that fun is a frivolous or unproductive use of time, which is not necessarily true. "Laughter" and "spontaneous" are also related to having fun, but they are more specific and do not capture the broad motivation for why people want to have fun.
In academic settings, a 4.0 GPA is generally considered a perfect score, indicating that the student has achieved the highest level of success in their courses. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person was feeling successful after receiving their grades. The other options are not congruent with the context of the sentence, as graduation is not mentioned and headaches or failing again would likely not be associated with a perfect GPA.
Rods and pistons are parts commonly found in engines, which are mechanical devices that convert fuel into motion. Engines are often used in vehicles such as cars, boats, and airplanes, as well as in industrial machinery and power generation systems. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for something that is not always found in a large volume, which suggests that the other options are typically found in a large volume. A collection or set of books, as well as a library, are commonly associated with large quantities of books. Similarly, a set of encyclopedias often includes multiple volumes. Costco, on the other hand, is a retail store and may or may not have large quantities of a particular item depending on the product.
The sentence suggests that Dan's mother emphasized the importance of bathing, which would be primarily for hygiene purposes. The option "cleanliness" directly relates to hygiene and therefore would be the correct answer. The other options either do not directly or indirectly relate to the context of the sentence or are erroneous (such as "nudity" being an outcome of bathing).
The sentence suggests that the cow was famous or well-known, which could be due to being featured in an advertisement. Advertisements often use catchy or memorable imagery, such as a famous cow, to promote a product or brand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally and another person were waiting in the rain, which implies that they were waiting for some form of transportation. The option "take bus" is the only option that relates to transportation, and waiting for the bus is a common experience. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Based on the context of the sentence, it suggests that the fork is likely a utensil that is used for eating, and therefore it would be most practical to store it in a kitchen drawer when not in use. A box or plane do not seem like appropriate places to store utensils, while a table or plate could result in the fork getting dirty or lost.
The word "customers" implies that the context is related to a commercial or business setting. Among the options given, only the mall is a place specifically designed for customers to walk around and browse shops. Parks are primarily for leisure and outdoor activities, markets usually have stalls or booths where customers can purchase goods, restaurants are typically for dining and not walking around, and bookstores may have seating areas but are not known for customers walking around.
The sentence suggests that a great singer's voice is going to possess certain qualities. While volume may be important for some styles of singing, the use of the word "beautiful" implies that this is the primary characteristic being referred to here. Beauty in a vocalist's voice is subjective, but is generally related to tone, timbre, and resonance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about indoor activities that can be done during the winter, which suggests that the correct answer should involve something that can be done inside the house. Skiing, skating, and playing hockey are outdoor winter sports that require specific equipment and spaces, so they are unlikely to be done inside the house. "Blaze it" is a non sequitur and has no relation to the question. Knitting, on the other hand, is a common indoor hobby, and it is a popular winter activity for many people.
A basketball court is typically used for playing the sport of basketball. The other options do not relate to the function or purpose of a basketball court. "City" and "Los Angeles" are locations and do not imply a specific purpose. "Use" is too broad and could apply to any function or activity. "Soccer" is a different sport and typically played on a soccer field, not a basketball court.
The sentence suggests that the extrovert enjoys interacting with strangers while taking public transportation to school. This implies that the extrovert is likely to take a bus instead of other modes of transportation such as a train or a taxi. The park and town do not have any connection to public transportation, and are therefore unlikely options.
The sentence suggests that the weather can be difficult to predict, which implies that it may change frequently and without warning. This could be due to a variety of factors such as atmospheric conditions, geography, and climate patterns. The other options, such as "clear" or "hot or cold", do not add much insight into why the weather might be difficult to predict.
The sentence suggests that the person did not feel supported by others and was often disappointed by their actions. "Let down" means to disappoint someone by failing to provide them with the expected or needed support, which makes it the best choice among the given options. "Ignore" and "neglect" are similar in meaning, but they do not convey the sense of being let down by someone who was expected to provide support. "Marriage" and "aid" are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the subject tripped, which would likely result in them falling down. The other choices are not appropriate based on the context of the sentence - sweating and getting tired are common outcomes of running, but they do not specifically relate to tripping. Flying is not a plausible option at all, and working out is not an outcome of tripping.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a mechanism that locks after someone drives in. A gate is a common feature of a driveway or entrance to a property, and it can have a locking mechanism to prevent unauthorized entry. The other options are less likely to have locking mechanisms and don't necessarily fit the context of a driveway or entrance.
Universities are widely regarded as institutions where higher education is provided, and as such, they usually offer courses in various disciplines, including science. While some of the other options, such as a state college or even a nanotechnology institution, may also offer courses in science, universities are generally associated with a broad range of academic fields. A space lab might suggest a place where scientific experiments are carried out in space, which is not what the question is asking. The option "school" is too general and does not provide any specific information.
The other options (Nebraska, fairy tale, moon, slaughterhouse) do not fit the context of the question. An advertisement is a medium used to promote a product or service, and it is not uncommon to see fake animals being used in advertisements to grab people's attention. Therefore, it makes sense that one could find a fake cow in an advertisement.
The sentence suggests that the lizard was trying to warm itself up, which means it would need to be in a warm location. The term "sunny place" implies a location that receives direct sunlight, which is a source of warmth. The other options may not provide the warmth that the lizard needs, such as a shady spot or a porch, which may be cooler in temperature. Rocky areas and gardens are too general and do not provide any specific information related to the lizard's need for warmth.
The sentence mentions a specific location, above the cloud line, which is an altitude typically associated with high elevation areas such as mountains. A cottage in a village or rural area would not necessarily be above the cloud line, and a cottage in a valley would likely be surrounded by higher terrain. The mention of a fairy story does not provide any relevant information to determine the location of the cottage.
Sally's conflicting feelings about shopping suggest that she may have a fear or anxiety about spending money, which could explain why it is painful for her to buy things even though she loves getting what she wants. The phrase "loss of money" suggests that Sally may feel a sense of financial insecurity or stress when she spends money, which would be consistent with her mixed feelings about shopping. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence or the possible reasons why Sally might find shopping painful.
Going to bed is typically associated with the need for sleep, which is often characterized by feelings of sleepiness or tiredness. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Bad dreams may be a reason someone wakes up or has trouble falling asleep, but not necessarily a reason for going to bed. Laziness and getting pregnant are also not directly related to the act of going to bed. Rest could be a reason for someone to take a break or relax, but it is not necessarily a synonym for going to bed.
Forgiveness is often associated with the concept of redemption, which refers to the act of restoring oneself to a state of moral righteousness or being saved from wrongdoings. The fact that the man is forgiving someone who betrayed him suggests that he is trying to redeem himself and move on from the negative feelings associated with the betrayal. The other options are not directly related to the concept of forgiveness and redemption.
In the context of preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle, it is common to keep the males and females separated in a corral or pen. A corral is a confined area used for holding livestock, which would allow for easy separation and management of the animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle.
The question suggests that expressing oneself in simple terms is likely to have a certain outcome, and the most logical outcome would be that people will understand what is being expressed. Expressing oneself in simple terms is a way of making ideas accessible and easy to grasp, which should lead to greater understanding. The other options have no apparent connection to the context of the question.
The question suggests that playing a board game with family is an activity typically done in a domestic setting, which is why the correct answer is "house." The other options do not fit the context of the question. A "toy store" and "shelf" are not places where one would typically play a board game, and a "mall" is a public space that is not typically associated with playing games. "Cupboard" is also not a suitable option, as it refers to a storage space, rather than a location for an activity.
A police officer typically reports their work by creating a case file. This file includes details of the incident, witness statements, evidence collected, and any actions taken by the officer, such as charging a person with a crime. Creating a case file is an important part of police work as it provides a record of the incident, which may be used in court or for further investigation. The other options do not seem to be related to reporting police work.
The context of the sentence suggests that the red telephone box is a common sight in the countryside of a particular country. The option "england" fits this context as red telephone boxes are commonly associated with England, particularly in rural areas. The other options, such as a restaurant or doctor, do not provide any context that would suggest the presence of a red telephone box. The option "city on street corner" may be a possible location for a phone box, but it contradicts the information that the sentence is set in the countryside.
The word "confident" implies that someone is sure of themselves and their abilities. Therefore, it makes sense that a confident person would trust themselves and their decisions. Feeling important or owning a house do not necessarily relate to confidence, while crying suggests the opposite of confidence, which is vulnerability or insecurity. Knowing what time also does not relate to confidence.
The sentence suggests that James is looking for a large church, which is often referred to as a megachurch. Megachurches are typically found in urban areas, which have larger populations and more resources to support such large places of worship. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is accessed through a staircase and is likely used for storage, as indicated by the reference to a jar of preserves. Out of the given options, only a cellar is typically accessed through a staircase and used for storing items like preserves. The other options do not match the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person had a trait that made them likely to get hired quickly for a job. The characteristic mentioned in the sentence is that the person had a reputation for something, and the context implies that this characteristic is a positive one. Working hard is a highly desirable trait for an employee, as it shows dedication and a willingness to put in effort for the job. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be traits that would help someone get hired quickly.
The sentence suggests that two people have different knowledge or information and want to help each other by sharing what they know. In this scenario, the best course of action would be for both individuals to teach each other what they know, so that both parties benefit from the exchange. The other options either do not involve any exchange of knowledge or are not likely to be relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the legal consequences of killing. Killing is usually considered a crime, which could result in a criminal trial. Guilty conscience, pleasure, and a fun day out are not appropriate responses because they do not relate to the legal consequences of killing. Retribution is a possible consequence of a criminal trial, but it is not the direct answer to the question being asked.
Encyclopedias are reference books that contain information on various topics. They were popular before the age of the internet and search engines, but now they are considered outdated as information can be easily accessed through digital sources. The other choices may still be valid sources of gaining knowledge, especially books and libraries, which are still widely used.
The phrase "being as she was committed" suggests that the woman has other obligations or commitments that may prevent her from showing up. This makes it unlikely that she will actually appear. The options "wont," "weakness," and "definitely" do not fit the context of the sentence and are not supported by any evidence. "Will" is a possibility, but the phrase "being as she was committed" suggests that it is not very likely.
The sentence indicates that after exiting a ring road, the destination is a group of homes. Therefore, the correct answer is "home." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The freeway system could be a possibility if the destination was further away and required the use of highways. The town, cars, and European city do not provide any indication of a specific destination.
The question suggests that learning to ski was a challenging activity, and the answer options provide possible difficulties that the person might have encountered. The option "maintain balance" is the most likely answer, as skiing requires a significant amount of balance and coordination to stay upright on the slopes. The other options, such as slipping on ice or falling down, are common occurrences while learning to ski but are not the most challenging aspect of the activity. Sweat is not directly relevant to the question and is not a difficulty that would typically be associated with learning to ski.
The phrase "clinging on to life" suggests that the person in question is in a very critical condition and is struggling to survive. The options "ending soon," "ill," "coma," and "void" may apply to someone who is experiencing a serious health challenge, but they do not specifically indicate that the person's life is in danger. "Death" is the only option that explicitly conveys the idea of a person fighting to stay alive.
The sentence describes a medieval costumed man playing music and moving their hands wildly on the fingerboard, which suggests a stringed instrument with a fingerboard. Of the options given, only the lute, guitar, banjo, mandolin, and violin are stringed instruments, but only the violin has a fingerboard. Additionally, the violin was a popular instrument during the medieval period, making it a likely choice for the musician in question.
The question suggests that going for a run too many times can have negative consequences on the body, specifically related to the legs. Leg cramps are a common issue for runners who overexert their muscles and do not properly stretch or rest. Becoming tired and muscles are also possible outcomes of running too much, but they are not as specific to the legs as leg cramps. Trip and feeling refreshed are not logical outcomes of running too much, based on the context of the question.
A tornado is a natural disaster that can cause high-speed winds and can pick up objects and hurl them through the air. Furniture can become a projectile in a tornado as it is lifted off the ground and carried by the wind. The other options (canon, baseball, battle field, war zone) do not provide any context that suggests how furniture could become a projectile.
The sentence suggests that the person is in a mountainous area and is chopping fuel for a fire. When they see a marmot, they would likely release it in its natural habitat, which in this case would be the mountains. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context or behavior of marmots.
The sentence suggests that there is a weapon that has the specific capability of targeting the nose of an aircraft. This narrows down the choices to options that are weapons and can target a specific part of an aircraft. Out of these options, the only weapon that can specifically target a part of an aircraft is a missile. The other options are not weapons or do not have the capability of targeting a specific part of an aircraft.
The sentence suggests that spending too much time contemplating something can lead to a negative outcome, specifically a type of pain. The options "relaxation" and "deciding" do not fit with this negative connotation, and "regret" also doesn't make sense as a result of merely contemplating something. "Revelations" could potentially fit, but it is not typically associated with pain. The remaining option, "headache," is a well-known effect of prolonged mental strain or excessive thinking, making it the correct option.
The verb "burned" suggests that they destroyed the record intentionally, and the phrase "trying to do what to history" implies that it was an attempt to alter or erase history. The other options -- compact disc, tape, rewrite, and play music -- do not fit the context of the sentence and are not activities that would be associated with altering history.
The sentence suggests that the released patient had been in the hospital for a while and was feeling unwell. Breathing fresh air suggests that the patient was outside, which could have helped them feel better. The other options do not necessarily suggest an improvement in the patient's health or well-being.
Dentist offices are often located in office buildings, as these offer a professional atmosphere and convenient location for patients. Hospitals may have dental clinics, but they are typically located within the hospital complex and may not be accessible to the general public. Shopping malls and streets are also unlikely locations for a dental practice, as they do not offer the necessary privacy and infrastructure for medical procedures. The location of Minnesota is not relevant to the context of the question.
The word "ficus" refers to a type of houseplant, which is commonly grown in flowerpots indoors. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as a farm or arboretum are outdoor locations and the plant kingdom and science class are not specific enough to suggest where a ficus would be grown.
The sentence tells us that the neolithic person was hungry, which suggests that they needed to find a way to obtain food. Out of the given choices, "hunt for food" is the most logical solution to this problem. In prehistoric times, hunting and gathering were the primary ways of obtaining food, so it makes sense that this would be the neolithic person's solution. The other options do not provide a practical solution to the problem of hunger.
The phrase "just a few passengers" suggests a small vehicle, which points to the option of a car. Transportation and vehicle are general terms that can refer to any mode of transportation, and bus depot and train station both suggest larger modes of transportation that would accommodate more passengers. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a car.
Christianity teaches that believers can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus Christ, and that death is not the end, but a transition to eternal life with God. Therefore, a Christian is likely to feel reconciled, or at peace, about their death if they believe in Jesus Christ. The other options do not align with Christian beliefs about death.
The sentence suggests that the act of closing one's eyes while resting is associated with a positive feeling. The other choices are not consistent with this context. Laziness, falling asleep, and laying down all suggest a lack of activity or productivity. "Feel better" is too vague and could apply to a number of scenarios, while relaxation is the most likely answer as it implies a sense of comfort and calmness.
A medicine cabinet or medicine chest is typically where people store personal hygiene products such as deodorant, as well as other health and beauty items like toothbrushes, razors, and medications. The other options, such as using a spray or keeping it in the shower, do not make as much sense because they may decrease the shelf-life or effectiveness of the product. Keeping deodorant in one's own bathroom is plausible, but the most commonly associated storage location is the medicine cabinet or medicine chest.
The question is asking what someone expressing anger will shake their fists to do, and the most common action associated with shaking fists in anger is punching. Other options like twerking, illustrating a point, cooling off, or writing a letter do not have any direct association with shaking fists in anger.
The sentence states that the person created music to share how they felt with another, which suggests that their goal was to convey their emotions through music. The option "express emotion" is the only one that aligns with this idea. The other options do not match the context of the sentence, for example, "quiet mind" and "beautiful" do not relate to creating music to share emotions. "Boredom" and "irritate" have a negative connotation, which seems unlikely to be the intended goal of the person creating the music.
The sentence suggests that the person is putting on a performance when interacting with customers in her sales job, despite feeling tired. The word "persona" refers to an individual's public image or the personality they present to others, which fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options (smile, laugh, act, singing) could also be possible answers, but they do not capture the full extent of what the person is doing in their sales job.
The question is asking for a term that describes food that can be consumed without causing harm or discomfort. The term "edible" specifically refers to food that is safe and suitable for consumption. The other options do not accurately describe food that is safe for consumption. "Spoiled" implies that the food is rotten or inedible, "necessary to live" describes a basic need that food fulfills, "supermarket" is a place where food is sold, but it doesn't indicate whether the food is safe to eat or not, and "unhealthy" describes the quality of the food, but again, not its edibility.
The sentence suggests that saws were in high demand, and that people needed them frequently. It also implies that people had a specific place where they stored their saws. A "toolbox" is a common place to store tools like saws, and it makes sense that people would have their own personal boxes to house their own tools. The other options, such as "hospital," "logging camp," and "basement," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is not actually crying but pretending to do so. In this context, the term "act" means to pretend, and it is often used when referring to someone who is pretending to be a character or emotion that they are not actually feeling. Yelling, getting injured, being hurt, or being miserable are unrelated to the context of pretending to cry.
The sentence suggests that the police witnessed a car that was in motion, indicating that the suspect was driving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions that the person is not a man, which indicates that they likely carry a purse or some type of bag with them. The question also suggests that the change will be used soon, which means it needs to be easily accessible. Putting change in a wardrobe or backseat of a car would not be practical as it would be difficult to access when needed. A jar is not a common place to store change outside of a home or office, so the most practical option is to put the change in a purse.
The question is asking about the negative aspect of playing games, and losing is a common frustration that many people experience when playing games. Learning may also be challenging, but it is not necessarily the "worst" part for everyone. Happiness and competition are positive aspects and do not fit the question's premise. Fatigue may be a physical challenge, but it is not necessarily the worst part of playing games for everyone.
The sentence suggests that the mother's desired destination is associated with peace and quiet. Home is a common place where people seek refuge and relaxation, making it the best fit for the context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that getting wet could potentially lead to drowning, but it does not state it as a certain outcome. "Could" indicates possibility or probability, making it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning conveyed in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to get coffee without leaving their car, which is commonly offered at fast food restaurants through their drive-thru service. Gas stations and supermarkets may have coffee available for purchase, but they may not offer it in a way that allows the person to stay in their car. Grocery stores and friend's houses are unlikely places to stop for coffee if the person is looking for convenience.
The sentence describes a storey (or level) that contains multiple small restaurants. This is a common feature of a mall, which often has multiple levels with a variety of stores and restaurants. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. City halls typically contain government offices, an apartment building usually contains residential units, and a book of stories is a literary work, not a physical structure. Tall building is too broad and does not provide enough information.
The sentence indicates that James had a deep respect and admiration for Bill, but Bill did not reciprocate these feelings. The word "religious" suggests that James held Bill in very high regard, possibly even idolizing him. The word "reverence" reinforces this idea, as it means deep respect or admiration. The word "irreverence" is the opposite of reverence, indicating a lack of respect or disrespect, and therefore is the correct answer. The other options (profanity, content, blasphemy, contempt) do not accurately reflect how Bill treated James in the sentence.
A synonym is a word that has a similar meaning to another word. In this case, the word "faith" means a strong belief in something, often without proof or evidence. The word "belief" also means a strong conviction or acceptance that something is true or real, and is therefore a good synonym for "faith." The other options do not have the same meaning as "faith" or are expressions that are used in a different context.
The sentence is referring to the tallest plant found on Earth, and trees are the most common type of plant that can grow to great heights. Other options like orbit, pressure, space, and solar system are not related to the context of the question and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence suggests that the person is staying in bed during the weekend, which is often associated with taking advantage of the opportunity to sleep longer than usual. "Sleep in" refers to sleeping later than one normally would, and is a common reason why people may stay in bed on the weekend. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where someone can take a break from driving and relax, which is a common feature of rest areas. Rest areas typically have amenities such as restrooms, picnic tables, and benches for travelers to use while taking a break from the road. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Motorcycles are generally lighter than cars, which allows them to be more agile and accelerate more quickly. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that James is typically good at expressing himself, but on this particular occasion, he was struggling to communicate. The word "eloquent" suggests that James has a way with words, while "muttering" implies that he was struggling to articulate his thoughts. The other options (speechless, voiceless, screaming, stumbling) do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not describe someone who is trying to speak but having difficulty doing so.
The sentence suggests that there is a place that could be abbreviated as "Jackson" but there would be a missing or incomplete reference if you did so. Mississippi is commonly associated with the city of Jackson, which is the state capital and a major metropolitan area. If you called the place "Jackson" for short, you would be leaving out the state name and therefore not providing a complete reference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a way to grow a ficus on their patio. The options "tropical forest" and "arboretum" refer to natural environments and do not provide any guidance on how to grow a plant in a specific location. "Soil" is important for growing plants, but it is not a suitable answer for this question because the speaker is looking for a container to grow the ficus in. "Large pot" is a more specific answer than "pots" and may be correct in some cases, but the size of the pot depends on the size of the plant and the space available on the patio. Therefore, the best answer is "pots," which suggests that the speaker should consider using multiple containers to grow the ficus on their patio.
The context of the sentence suggests that the word "diaphragm" refers to a form of birth control that is designed to be inserted into a woman's body. Therefore, the answer must be a location where a diaphragm would not be found if there is no one to insert it. A drugstore sells various forms of birth control, so it is not a viable option. The other options are all related to the human body, which is where a diaphragm would be found.
The question is asking about a situation where students may have to attend more than one period, which typically refers to different class periods throughout the day. The option "math" is the most likely choice, as many schools have multiple periods for math classes due to the importance of the subject and the need for extra instruction time. The other options do not have any relevance to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the woman was actively seeking sexual activity with a man. The phrases "determined" and "flirt" imply that she is focused on achieving this objective, and the options "get in bed" and "have sex" are also synonymous with this goal. "Attract attention" and "train" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not imply a desire for sexual activity.
A monument is typically a structure or statue that is erected in memory of a person who has passed away. In most cases, monuments are placed in cemeteries where the individual is buried. This is because cemeteries are typically places of mourning and reflection, making them an appropriate location for a memorial. The other choices do not fit the context as they are not typically associated with monuments or memorials.
Bars are establishments that serve alcoholic beverages, making them the most logical choice for businesses that serve liquor. Fraternity houses may serve beer or other beverages, but they are not typically licensed to serve liquor. Cabinets are furniture pieces, and State Farm is an insurance company. Soft drinks do not contain alcoholic content, so they cannot be considered as businesses that serve liquor.
The sentence suggests that the house is located in a remote area and not connected to any other buildings or infrastructure, which means that it would need a street to allow visitors to access it. A street provides a pathway and connection to other areas, which is necessary for visitors to reach the house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as a city, residential area, subdivision, or milk man would not necessarily help visitors access the house.
The sentence suggests that the world is home to many different types of people and places, which points to the idea of diversity. Additionally, the use of the word "big" implies that the world is extensive and encompasses a lot of different things, another aspect of diversity. The other options, such as "complicated" or "square," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
The items listed are commonly associated with the time period of the Old West, such as whiskey and saddles for cowboys and grain for agriculture. The general store was a common fixture of towns during this time period, which sold a variety of goods including these items. The other options, such as a shopping mall or meat store, do not fit the context of the question and are not associated with the Old West.
The sentence suggests that engaging in a certain activity will cause the individual to need a rest. Being active, or engaging in physical activity, is a common cause of fatigue and the need for rest. Paying debts and wakefulness do not necessarily require physical exertion, while resthold and in motion are not commonly used terms and do not provide clear context to the sentence.
The sentence makes it clear that the company was concerned about profit, which suggests they were looking to cut something that was costing them money. Expenses are costs associated with running a business, so it makes sense that they would be the target of the cost-cutting measures. "Losses", "losing money", and "lose money" all refer to the same thing and could be considered redundant answers. "Eat cake" is a nonsensical option that does not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that something in the building is located at a significant height from the ground floor. This would usually be the ceiling of the building, which is above all the floors and can be very far from the ground level. The other options do not make sense in this context - the basement is usually below the ground floor, air and water do not have a specific height, and the sky is outside the building.
Fish are not capable of flying, and it is unlikely that they would intentionally flap their fins in the air unless they were attempting to jump or escape from a predator. This suggests that the correct answer is "attempt to fly." The other options, such as "school together" or "hatred," do not make sense in the context of a fish flapping its fins in the air.
This question refers to the phenomenon of throwing a pebble into a body of water to create ripples. Cups and aquariums are too small to create noticeable ripples, while playgrounds and lakes are too large. A pond is a smaller body of water that is large enough to create noticeable ripples when a pebble is thrown into it, making it the correct answer.
The sentence mentions that the boss asked the person to speak to a group that same afternoon. The word "meeting" is the only choice that fits this context, as all the others imply a different audience or setting. A "university" or "class" would suggest a more formal or educational environment, while an "office party" or "book" would imply a more casual or festive atmosphere. Therefore, "meeting" is the most fitting answer.
The sentence suggests that the tool is related to a car since it is stored in the same place as the car. The most logical option would be the garage, which is where cars are typically stored. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lifting weights is a common exercise for building muscle. Muscles are the primary focus of weightlifting, and in order to gain muscle mass, one must consistently lift weights and challenge their body. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of lifting weights; breaths and shortness of breath are related to cardio exercises, effort is required in any exercise, and discipline is a personal trait that can be applied to any activity.
The word "hit" suggests forceful impact, which would cause glass to shatter rather than melt. Glass that has been hit is likely to have sharp, jagged edges and not easily hold water. While glass can come in many different colors, this information is not relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that a bad smell is causing someone to want to leave and the word "fart" specifically refers to a bodily function that can produce an unpleasant odor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A rose bush, for example, is unlikely to emit a strong odor that would make someone want to leave, and "go back," "die," and "arrive there" are not related to the topic of bad smells.
The sentence suggests that the person was uncomfortable due to the stuffy environment and decided to breathe fresh air instead. Breathing fresh air would provide relief from the discomfort caused by the stuffy environment, making the person feel better. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a line and the more people who join the line, the result is (blank). Longer lines make sense in this context because a greater number of people would mean that the line would become longer. The other options do not make as much sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the interrogators resorted to extreme measures to get the information they needed from the prisoner. The phrase "least human thing" implies that the action was cruel and inhumane, which rules out options like "better himself" and "think and reason". "Have fever" does not make sense in this context, leaving "hurt" and "torture" as the only plausible options. However, since the sentence specifies that they "began to", it is more likely that the correct answer is "torture" as this suggests a prolonged and intentional action rather than a one-time act of violence.
The sentence is asking about a characteristic of a heart, which typically refers to the organ that pumps blood throughout the body. While all mammals do have hearts, the use of "characteristically" suggests that the answer is more specific. Dogs, artichokes, and hospitals do not have hearts in the traditional sense, so those options can be eliminated. Therefore, the answer is person, since people are the only option that typically possess a heart as an organ.
The sentence mentions "narrow halls," which suggests that visitors may have to walk through cramped and uncomfortable spaces. Walking for an extended period of time in narrow halls can cause physical discomfort and result in sore feet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah was a successful saleswoman, but despite her achievements, she was never recognized for something specific. The word "acknowledge" implies that there was some sort of recognition or reward that Sarah deserved but did not receive. Based on the context, it seems like Sarah's lack of recognition was not related to her ability to work hard or sell products (which she was already successful at), but rather something that had to do with her overall output or productivity. The other options do not seem to fit the context as well.
The use of the word "nowadays" suggests that the answer relates to modern times. The other options, such as books and manuals, imply traditional forms of information gathering that are becoming increasingly less common in the digital age. "Online" is a synonym for the internet, so it is possible that it could be a correct answer. "Meeting" does not relate to information gathering at all and is therefore an unlikely answer.
The sentence suggests that James watches films as a way to alleviate his high-strung state. This implies that he may be looking for a way to unwind and relax, making "relaxation" the most appropriate answer. The other options do not accurately reflect James' motivation for watching films.
The context of the sentence is that Bob is lighting a fire in the wood stove in the winter. This implies that he wants to stay warm since winters can be cold. Out of the given options, only "warm house" suits the context of the sentence. The other choices such as "emit light" or "boil water" do not relate to the idea of keeping warm in wintertime.
The sentence suggests that Jim made a mistake while driving which caused him to hit a car. The clue to identifying the correct answer is that Jim mistook forward for something else, indicating that he may have been in the wrong gear. Reverse is the option that makes the most sense in this context as it is the opposite of forward and commonly used when driving a car in the opposite direction. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

The sentence suggests that a place has stopped giving out plastic shopping bags, which is a common practice in grocery stores. Grocery stores are often considered the primary source of plastic bag waste, and many have taken steps to reduce or eliminate their use of plastic bags in recent years. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person who spent all summer playing video games was the son. Therefore, it would not be surprising for his mother to find dirty dishes in his room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Jogging is a physical activity that can help burn calories and promote weight loss, making it a common reason why people decide to start jogging. The other options, such as suicide, blisters, sweating, and shortness of breath, are not typical motivations for starting a new exercise routine.
The sentence indicates that James believed the desk was well-built and sturdy, but when he rapped on it, he could hear something that contradicts this. The word "hollowness" suggests that the desk has empty space inside, possibly indicating that it is not as solid as James originally thought. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the objects listed are part of something larger or more abstract. The term "nature" is commonly used to describe the world around us, including plants and animals. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they refer to specific locations or things that are not relevant to the objects listed.
The sentence suggests that the clarity of the class made it almost "invisible," indicating that the information presented was easy to understand and comprehend. The other choices all suggest a lack of clarity or understanding, which contradicts the idea that the class was clear.
The sentence indicates that the mayor wanted the road to be "complete," suggesting that it was still under construction or not yet fully built. The adjective "frustrated" further implies that there were obstacles or difficulties preventing the completion of the road, which could be indicative of it being unfinished. The other options do not accurately convey the sense of incompleteness or frustration suggested in the sentence.
The clue "knob" suggest a physical control mechanism, and "emits light and sound" suggests that it is some sort of electronic device. Control panels can feature knobs or buttons and often emit visual and auditory signals, making it the most likely answer. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context provided in the question.
The sentence suggests that Billy loves grapes and similar foods, which implies that the gift his friends bought him is likely to contain a variety of fruits, such as apples, oranges, and bananas, in addition to grapes. A fruit basket is a common gift that contains a variety of fruits, making it the most likely option. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the doctor noticed a problem with the patient's lung based on a specific symptom related to breathing. The fact that the patient was coughing every time they breathed suggests that something was obstructing the airway or causing irritation in the lung. The other options all relate to general breathing actions and do not necessarily indicate a problem with the lung in particular.
The sentence includes specific information about a game where large men in pads run and smash into each other. This is a clear reference to American football, which is commonly played in stadiums. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "competition" implies a goal-oriented activity in which individuals or teams strive to perform their best in order to achieve success. "Jealousy" and "enemies" are negative emotions and not productive goals in a competition. "Wins" and "losing" are possible outcomes of the competition, but they are not goals. "Success" reflects the positive outcome of the competition and is the most appropriate answer to the question.
The question asks where personal mushrooms can be kept fresh, implying that mushrooms are perishable and need to be stored properly to maintain their freshness. Of the choices given, only the refrigerator is a common method of storing fresh produce. The other options are not related to mushroom storage or food preservation.
Typing involves pressing keys on a keyboard to input text into a document or program. Therefore, the most likely thing you would be creating while typing is a printed word, such as a document, email, or report. A letter or birthday card could also be created through typing, but these are more specific examples. Pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are not things that are typically associated with typing, but rather potential negative consequences if proper ergonomic techniques are not used.
Chewing is a necessary part of the digestion process that breaks down food to make it easier for the body to absorb nutrients. Drinking while eating can sometimes interfere with this process, and watching TV or talking can distract from the act of eating and make it more difficult to focus on chewing properly. Therefore, chewing is the most appropriate answer.
Fountains are often found in public places such as parks, plazas, and other outdoor areas where people gather. They are a common feature in urban environments and are often used as decorative elements or to provide a source of water for people and animals. Courtyards are also a possible location for fountains, but they are not as common as public places. The other options, such as city, Rome, or police station, are too general or specific to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the two teams were engaged in intense physical activity, as indicated by the phrase "competing out there." Additionally, the phrase "had all worked up" implies that they had become physically exerted, which leads to sweating. None of the other choices necessarily indicate physical activity or exertion.
The question is asking about what comes after verbal agreement on a deal, which is likely to involve some gesture or action to solidify the agreement. Shaking hands is a common way to signal a formal agreement or deal, and is often seen as a symbolic representation of trust and mutual respect between parties. Expressing agreement or nodding are more general gestures that may not specifically indicate a formal agreement or deal, while 'concordance' and 'gendering' do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Thermometers are commonly used in medical settings to measure body temperature. They are also used in hospitals and doctor's offices for diagnostic purposes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the focus is on betting on cards in various games, which would typically occur in a gambling setting such as a casino. A toy store is unlikely to have gambling-related items, while the terms "table" and "table play" are too vague to indicate a specific location. "Deck" is also too general and could refer to any location where cards are sold or used.
The sentence mentions Navy ships, which suggests that the location is a naval port. San Diego is a well-known naval port in California, which is also close to the Mexican border. Additionally, the sentence mentions an "authentic Mexican restaurant," which further supports the idea that the location is in San Diego since it has a large Mexican population and is known for its Mexican food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Open air markets are typically associated with smaller, more rural communities like villages. These markets often sell locally grown produce and homemade goods, which are more commonly found in rural areas where farming and small-scale production is more prevalent. While it is possible to find open air markets in cities, they are usually smaller and more specialized. The other options, like field or buy fresh vegetables, do not necessarily suggest the presence of an open air market.
The sentence suggests that the consequence of eating too much food is being full, which is a normal physiological response to satiety. Laziness, weight gain, and getting fat are potential long-term consequences of overeating if it becomes a habit, but they do not necessarily occur immediately after a single episode of overeating. "Will not starve" is not a consequence of overeating but rather the opposite, emphasizing that the person will have enough food to sustain them.
The other options in the choices are generally considered good or positive things. "Make friends" and "learn from each other" are social and personal development activities that most people would consider to be beneficial. "Stand upright" is a physical posture that is generally seen as healthy and desirable. "Donate to charity" is an act of philanthropy that is typically viewed positively. In contrast, "use drugs" is often seen as a bad thing because it can have negative health effects, lead to addiction, and cause social and personal problems.
The sentence clearly states that a condom is specifically designed for use on a penis as a form of contraceptive. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the answer choice for diaphragm should also refer to a body part related to contraception. The vagina is a common site for contraceptive devices and is often associated with the use of a diaphragm. The other options are not related to contraception or reproductive health.
The sentence clearly indicates that the stack of dishes is dirty and high. This suggests that they need to be cleaned, as leaving them in their current state would result in unhygienic conditions. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "stand watch" suggests a guarding or monitoring activity, which is commonly associated with a guard tower. The other options (department store, bathroom cabinet, bedroom drawer, jewellers) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "morning pill" suggests that the pill is part of a daily medication routine, which is often stored in a designated place like a medicine cabinet. The other options are not typically associated with daily medication routines and would not be logical places to look for a morning pill.
The sentence suggests that food is the likely culprit for clogging plumbing in a specific location. The options of bathroom, wall, oil refineries, and water park all do not have a strong association with food or plumbing. However, kitchens are where food is prepared and disposed of, which makes it likely that food could accidentally get into the plumbing and cause a clog.
The sentence suggests that the sound of a lawnmower is heard from across the street, which indicates that someone is currently mowing their lawn. The other options (shed, garage, neighbor's house) do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they are not related to the activity of cutting grass. The option lawn is tempting because it is related to cutting grass, but it does not answer the question about the location of the lawnmower.
The sentence suggests that Rita enjoyed the taste of a specific type of plant called anemone, which is commonly found in flower shops as a type of decorative flower. The other options, such as a neighbor's house or a seafood restaurant, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with the taste of anemone.
William the Conqueror is known for crossing the English Channel to invade and conquer England in 1066. The other options do not have any relevance to this historical event.
The sentence suggests that drinking alcohol can have negative consequences. The phrase "in addition to making you sick" implies that there are other negative effects that result from drinking alcohol. One common consequence of drinking alcohol is impaired judgment and coordination, which can lead to accidents while driving or participating in other activities. The other options do not make logical sense as potential consequences of drinking alcohol.
The sentence suggests that the person is cooking towards the end of the day, which is a common time for people to prepare their evening meal, also known as dinner. "Having dinner" is also a common phrase used to refer to eating an evening meal. The other options do not make sense in the context of preparing food at the end of the day.
The sentence suggests that Bill was often bored and would stare off. Daydreaming is a common activity for people who are bored and have nothing else to occupy their minds. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - Bill wouldn't be working if he was bored, and seeing visions is unlikely unless he has a medical condition. Fiddling, playing games and dreaming are also possible activities for someone who is bored, but daydreaming seems to fit the context better.
A saltshaker is a commonly used item in the kitchen, specifically for seasoning food. When it's not in use, it's typically stored in a convenient location within the kitchen, such as a cupboard or on a countertop. The other options are less likely to be the correct answer because an empty restaurant or table setting would not be the appropriate place to store a personal item like a saltshaker, and a cruet is a separate item used for storing and pouring liquids, not dry seasonings like salt.
Soldiers may be honored in various ways, but being honored at the White House is a commonly known tradition in the United States. The President of the United States often presents medals for valor and bravery to soldiers at the White House. The other options are not typically associated with formal military honors.
The sentence suggests that the place where you get round food has a baking oven, which is sometimes made of brick. This is a common feature in pizza parlors, which use brick ovens to bake their pizzas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the poster was most likely hanging on a wall or standing on a flat surface in the kitchen. Out of the choices provided, the most likely place for a poster to be hung or placed in a kitchen would be a shelf. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a poster is unlikely to be placed in a closet or a fridge, and it would be unusual to have a poster stored in a drawer. A poster could potentially be placed on a table, but it is less likely than being on a shelf.
The question is asking about a reason to pay your television bill, which implies that not paying the bill may have legal consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is "legal." The other choices -- informative, dead, entertaining, obsolete -- are irrelevant to the question and do not relate to reasons why someone would need to pay their television bill.
Civil action typically involves seeking compensation or resolution for a dispute or harm done to someone, rather than criminal charges that could result in jail time. Restitution, which involves payment or compensation to the harmed party, is a common outcome of civil action. The other options are not typically associated with civil action.
The word "clothes" in the question indicates that the answer should be a place where one can buy clothing. A "house" is a place where someone lives and is unlikely to sell clothes. Similarly, a "bedroom" is a room in a house and not a place to buy clothes. A "toy store" sells toys and not clothes. A "mall" is a large shopping center that typically has many stores, including clothing stores, making it a possible answer. However, "clothing store" is the most specific and accurate answer as it directly refers to a store that specializes in selling clothes.
When people get divorced, it is common for them to experience emotional distress such as grief, sadness, or anger. This can lead to a lot of crying and the need for tissues. The other options don't have a clear connection to divorce. Freedom might be a positive outcome of a divorce, but it's not something someone "produces". Richer is unlikely, as divorce often involves dividing assets. Depression may be a consequence of divorce, but it's not something someone "produces".
The sentence suggests that the person went to the bar to alleviate their boredom and found many characters there. Meeting interesting people is a common reason for going out to social places like bars. Playing games, skateboarding, and listening to music are activities that may not be common in bars, and the word "field" has no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "ambulance chasing" is commonly used to refer to lawyers who aggressively seek out clients for personal injury lawsuits. This suggests that the man in the sentence likely worked in a law office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there was a change in the scientists' initial belief due to new evidence. The word "impossibility" indicates that the scientists initially believed something could not happen. However, the phrase "new evidence" implies that their belief changed. The word "possibility" is the most likely choice as it indicates that there is now some chance that the previously deemed impossible event may occur. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not signify a change in the scientists' belief.
The sentence suggests that the kids had low self-esteem and did not believe they were exceptional in any way. However, the teacher's statement contradicts this and implies that each child has unique qualities that make them special. The word "special" is commonly used in this context to encourage and motivate children. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the hikers were concerned about the safety of the water they would encounter on their hike, which is why they brought a filtering straw. The context of the sentence implies that the hikers wanted to purify the water they drank to avoid getting sick. Therefore, the correct answer is water. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John was in a temporary lodging, specifically a hotel room, where he placed an unfamiliar item on the night table. The other options do not make sense in this context. He is unlikely to be in jail or a furniture store, while hallway and even homes do not provide enough information to be definitive.
The sentence suggests that the townhouse in question is not attached to other houses, which is a characteristic commonly associated with standalone structures such as those found in parks. It is unlikely that an apartment building would have single unattached townhouses, and suburban developments and suburbs typically have attached or semi-attached townhouses as part of larger developments. Michigan is a state and therefore does not have a townhouse, and there is no clear indication that the townhouse is located in a suburban development.
The sentence suggests that Bob is enjoying his time with Bill and is likely feeling happy. This can be inferred from the phrase "having fun." Additionally, the option "may laugh" could also be a valid answer, since laughter is often associated with feelings of happiness and enjoyment. The other options, such as "accident" or "stress relief," do not align with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct answers.
The context of the sentence suggests that James's workplace has new releases and bestsellers, which are typically associated with bookstores. Additionally, the fact that James has leisure time to browse these titles suggests that he works in a relatively quiet environment, which is also a common characteristic of bookstores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The language in the question suggests that the act of killing a large number of people is morally repugnant or detestable. The word "detestable" means deserving intense dislike or hatred, which is an appropriate term for describing someone who has committed such a heinous act. The other options do not have any clear relation to the context of the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that James needs to find his return ticket before he leaves for his next destination. The options "home," "tickets," and "pocket" do not make sense in this context because James is already at the hotel and is clearly searching for something specific. "Plane" could be a possible answer, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that James needs to find his ticket before boarding the plane. "Airport" makes the most sense because it is the most likely place for James to leave from to return to his destination.
The desert is known for its arid conditions and lack of water, which would make it the most likely place for a rosebush to die due to lack of water. The other options do not have the same association with dryness and lack of water.
Cats are known to have four legs, which are used for walking, running, jumping, and other forms of movement. While they also have other appendages such as tails and whiskers, these are not considered limbs or legs. Eyes are sensory organs, not limbs, and cats typically have two of them. Paws are the fleshy parts at the end of the legs that provide support and traction, but they are not separate appendages in themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is four legs.
The sentence suggests that the landmark is located in an area surrounded by many miles of plants, which is a characteristic commonly associated with national parks. National parks are often designated to preserve and protect natural environments, which may explain why the area around the landmark is filled with plants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about driving safely at night. Being awake and alert while driving is crucial to ensuring safety on the road, especially at night when visibility may be reduced. The other options, such as having a car or vehicle, are necessary to drive, but do not directly relate to driving safely at night. Distractions and napping are potential hazards to safe driving, and should be avoided while driving.
The sentence suggests that the person needed to sign some papers and retrieved their fountain pen from a specific location. The options "calligrapher's hand," "shirt pocket," and "portfolio" do not make sense in the context of retrieving a pen. "Blotter" is not a location where someone would typically store a pen. This leaves "desk drawer" as the most likely option, as it is a common place to keep writing instruments.
The question is asking about emotions people feel towards someone they love. Love is often associated with caring and devotion, which suggests that "care about" is the most appropriate answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of love or emotions towards a person.
The sentence indicates that Sarah went to school to become a nurse, which suggests that she has already acquired some skills in providing assistance to people. However, to better help people, the sentence implies that Sarah needs to continually improve her skills by learning new ones. The other options do not match the context of the sentence – "people helped" and "better circumstances" suggest outcomes rather than specific actions, "practice" may relate to skill-building but lacks the implication of seeking out new knowledge, and "happiness" is not clearly connected to the idea of providing assistance.
The sentence suggests that Sarah was cooking authentic soul food, which is a cuisine commonly associated with the southern United States. The option "boil vegetables" does not provide any information about Sarah's location or cuisine, while "kitchen cupboard" and "Italian restaurant" are unlikely to be connected to southern soul food. Therefore, "south" is the most likely answer.
The phrase "raise hell" typically refers to someone causing a disturbance or creating chaos, which would be in line with someone who is drunk and angry. The other options don't fit the context as well - appearing ridiculous, throwing up, and walking off may be potential consequences of being drunk, but they don't necessarily involve the person taking action against others. Fighting could be a possibility, but "raise hell" is a more appropriate phrase to use in this context.
The sentence explicitly states that the man wanted to clean his clothes, indicating that his main goal was to have clean garments. While having clean clothes may lead to a more attractive appearance, this is not the specific goal mentioned in the sentence. "Sanitation" is a more general term that does not match the context of the sentence, and "laundromat" is a location rather than a goal or outcome.
The sentence suggests that the weasel was scavenging on a farmer's land in the winter, which implies that it was searching for food. Chicken coops are common on farms and are often visited by predators looking for a meal. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, with the exception of the great outdoors, which is too general and does not provide any specific information.
The sentence mentions that Joe crossed a property boundary, which implies that he left his own property and entered someone else's. If he ran into a rosebush, it is likely that the bush was located in the neighbor's yard, which is a common place to find plants and landscaping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The bald eagle is a well-known symbol of the United States and is often associated with patriotism and national identity. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the bald eagle or its symbolism. Canada also uses the bald eagle as a symbol, but it is not as commonly associated with that country as it is with the U.S.
Nodding and shaking hands are commonly known as signs of agreement or approval in business deals or negotiations. While nodding signifies agreement, shaking hands is a gesture of mutual respect and signifies a successful agreement. Lying, whistling, or nodding and smiling may not be appropriate or recognized gestures for indicating agreement in a business context.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a physical divider between two buildings that cars drive on. Sidewalks are typically located next to buildings and are not meant for cars, while a fork in the road would generally lead to different directions rather than dividing two buildings. A living room and binder are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is street.
The sentence suggests that the people who gather together on Sundays share a belief about the origin of the Earth. The phrase "God's creation" refers to the belief that the Earth was created by a higher power or deity, which is a common belief in many religions. The other options are either scientific descriptions or not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy wants to have a picnic outside because he doesn't want to buy food from a restaurant. The option "addidas" is a brand of clothing and not related to the context of the sentence. "North America" is a continent and not a location suitable for a picnic. "Cafe" implies buying food from a restaurant, which Billy doesn't want to do. "Woodland" would not be a suitable location for Billy because he is allergic to trees and hates them. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside."
The sentence suggests that driving to work late can be unpleasant, but it implies that speeding is an inappropriate action to take. Speeding can be dangerous and can result in accidents or legal consequences. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cruise ships are known for providing luxury experiences for their passengers, with extravagant dining areas being a common feature. The limited space on a ship also means that every area needs to be utilized to the fullest, with dining areas often taking up a significant portion of the ship's interior. In contrast, a home or restaurant may have limited space and resources for extravagant dining areas, while a mall or "coming together" are not typically associated with dining areas at all.
The sentence implies that the person got drunk and is now refusing to get up off the floor because she thinks she might vomit again. The word "refused" suggests that she is resisting getting up, likely because she feels sick. The other options such as "walk", "staggering", and "fall down" don't fit the context of the sentence as they refer to movement rather than illness.
The sentence suggests that the object mentioned is something that can be used to prop up or elevate one's foot. Socks and shoes are worn on the feet, while a bar is not typically used for propping up feet. However, desks and tables are often used for this purpose, especially in a work or school setting where people may need to sit for extended periods of time.
The sentence does not provide any indication of what happens when ships are in a storm and the sun comes out. The options provided are unrelated to the context of the sentence and cannot be chosen as the correct answer. It is important to carefully read and understand the context of the sentence in order to make an informed decision when choosing the correct answer.
Bees are known for pollinating flowers, so it makes sense that they would spend time traveling in areas where flowers are present. Flower fields and fields of flowers are both plausible options for this reason, while an orchard may not necessarily have as many flowers for the bees to visit. The sky and the United States are both unlikely answers as they do not relate to the behaviors of bees.
The phrase "having fun" suggests that the answer should be related to an activity that is enjoyable or entertaining. "Cleaning house" and "constructing" are unlikely to be associated with fun for most people. "Kiss" may be enjoyable for couples, but it is not necessarily an activity that they plan to do for fun. "Wild ride" could be interpreted in various ways, but "playing around" is a common expression for couples engaging in playful or flirtatious behavior.
The sentence mentions that the location is known for its Vikings, which suggests that it is likely referring to a place with a strong Scandinavian heritage. Among the options provided, Minnesota fits this description the best, as it is home to many people of Norwegian and Swedish descent, and is also known for its Viking heritage, particularly in the city of Alexandria. The other options, such as California or England, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. The mention of the corner shop suggests that the location is a small, local establishment, which could be found on a street corner or at the corner of two streets.
The Milky Way is a term used to describe the galaxy in which our solar system resides. It is a vast, disc-shaped structure that contains billions of stars, dust, and gas. Therefore, the correct answer is "space." The other choices are either unrelated or do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence provides context clues that suggest that the item in question is related to shaving. The fact that it is described as a "double-edged razor" further confirms that it is a tool for grooming. The most logical option among the choices is the shaving kit, which is where one would typically store grooming tools such as razors. The other options (cricket ground, medicine cabinet, first aid kit, chemist) do not relate to shaving in any way, making them incorrect.
Birds are known for having wings, which they use to fly. The sentence mentions that birds do not have arms, which is a characteristic that distinguishes them from mammals. The other options either do not relate to the anatomy of birds or are redundant (such as "ability to fly," which is already implied by the mention of wings).
Going to school is often associated with obtaining an education or training that can lead to greater opportunities and success in life. While some individuals may go to school for socializing purposes, such as partying, the primary motivation for attending school is to gain knowledge and skills that can help one achieve their personal and professional goals. The other options, such as owning a house, having more leisure time, or not feeling pain, are not relevant factors in the decision to attend school.
The verb "walking" implies movement, so the correct answer should also relate to movement. "Exercise" is too broad and does not specifically describe what the body does while walking. "Getting somewhere" and "moving forward" are both correct, but "move" is the most general and accurate answer that encompasses all types of walking. "Keep moving forward" implies a specific direction, which is not necessarily true for all walks.
Pressing a pedal in a car typically controls some aspect of the car's movement. In this case, the options "go forward," "rush away," and "go fast" all generally mean the same thing as "gain speed," but are less specific. "Suffer damage" does not accurately describe the effect of pressing a pedal, and is therefore not a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the man who owned a lot of guns did not agree with the idea of more gun control. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is the opposite of "a great idea" or "controlled in Canada," which suggests gun control is a positive thing. The option "semiautomatic" refers to a type of gun and is not related to the man's opinion. The option "very dangerous" also does not fit the sentence because it describes the guns, not the man's opinion.
The sentence suggests that there was a ruin located underneath the site, indicating that some sort of excavation or digging may have been done. Out of the options given, "dug" is the only one that fits with this context. "Produce," "construct," and "new construction" suggest building or creating something rather than excavating, and "found" suggests only discovering the ruin and not acting upon it.
The sentence indicates that Brian took a tool from a shelf without permission and the cashier noticed him doing so. The use of the word "as" implies that the cashier spoke to him immediately after he started to leave, which suggests that the cashier wanted him to return the tool to its rightful place on the shelf. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence states that James "punched a man again and again," indicating that he used his hands and fists to hit the other person. As a result, it makes sense that some blood would cover his hands, which were likely in close proximity to the man's nose during the altercation. The other options have little to do with the context or logic of the sentence, as they are more abstract or unrelated to physical actions.
Apple trees need to be pollinated in order to create new trees. Pollinators such as bees and other insects are attracted to apple trees by the nectar produced by their flowers. In order for apple trees to produce more flowers and therefore more fruit, they need adequate nutrients and water, which are typically provided by healthy soil and sufficient irrigation. While a farm yard or farm-like setting may provide these conditions, the specific location options of New York or New Jersey do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that John had an important role or position, but when he was wronged, he could exhibit a negative trait. The word "petty" means to focus on small or insignificant details, which suggests that John may become irrationally fixated on minor wrongs or grievances. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe negative traits that John might exhibit when wronged.
The sentence suggests that the park was facing a problem with people leaving trash and litter around, and that they took measures to address this issue. The most logical solution would be to add more garbage cans or wastebaskets to the park, which would make it easier for visitors to dispose of their trash properly. The other options, such as a tip or incinerator, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence. A park officer could help enforce littering rules, but they would not directly address the problem of trash disposal.
The sentence states that Dan is driving a car, which implies that he is in a moving vehicle. However, it also states that he is stopped at a light currently, which means he is not currently moving. Therefore, we can assume that the only other activity he could be doing at this moment is listening to the radio, as there is no information provided about a car crash, getting sleepy, or where he is going.
The context of the question suggests that the focus is on what someone else does when someone is talking to them. The verb "talk" refers to speaking out loud, and the other options all suggest being silent or not interrupting, which is not specific enough to address the question. "Listening" is the best answer as it directly correlates to the act of someone speaking and someone else paying attention to what they are saying.
The phrase "dressed in a suit" suggests a formal attire typically worn for business or professional settings. Therefore, the most likely option is a business district, which is an area with many office buildings and commercial activities. The other options do not necessarily require formal attire, and would not necessarily warrant wearing a suit to park your car.
The sentence suggests that the person was trying to listen for the sound of a buffalo herd, which implies that they would need to use their sense of hearing. The most logical place for someone to use their ear to listen would be on their own head. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence or are nonsensical.
Grooming can refer to a variety of personal hygiene practices, including hair care. It is possible that excessive or aggressive brushing of the hair could lead to hair loss and bald spots. Brushing too hard can damage hair follicles or cause them to break, leading to hair loss. The other options do not have a clear connection to grooming causing bald spots.
The sentence suggests that in order to eat breakfast, the person must enter the kitchen. If the kitchen is barren, then there is no food or cooking supplies available, which means the person would need to prepare breakfast themselves. The options "eat food" and "buy food" assume that there is already food available, which is not the case in the given context. "Open mouth" and "wake up" are irrelevant and do not relate to the situation described in the sentence.
A petri dish is a common laboratory equipment used for growing bacteria. However, it is not a favorable place for bad bacteria as they are usually used to grow and study specific strains of bacteria. Sores, septic tanks, and mouths are all environments where bad bacteria can thrive and cause infections. Fingers can also harbor bad bacteria if proper hygiene is not practiced.
In many cultures, potatoes are a common ingredient in beef stew. The combination of potatoes and beef creates a hearty and filling meal, and the potatoes absorb the flavors of the other vegetables and spices in the stew. Restaurants, steak houses and gardens do not provide any specific context related to mixing potatoes with other veggies, while cooking pot is a generic term that does not suggest any particular dish or recipe.
The sentence implies that the person is leaving to run an errand and needs to lock something up for security. The options house, garage, safe, and trunk are not relevant because they are likely to remain stationary while the person is out. The automobile, however, is something that the person is likely to take with them and leave parked somewhere, making it the most sensible choice for locking up when running an errand.
The sentence suggests that the crab was in danger at the Tokyo fish market, which implies that people were trying to catch or sell it. Since crabs are aquatic animals, it is likely that it tried to escape into water. However, the last option, boiling water, is not a viable option for escape. The other options such as cold water, aquarium, and Pacific ocean are all types of water bodies, but the sentence specifically mentions that the crab ran away, which suggests it quickly moved away from the immediate vicinity. Tidepools are shallow pools of seawater that are often found on rocky coasts and can serve as a hiding place or shelter for small marine life, making it a logical choice for a crab to escape to in this scenario.
Water can turn into all of the options listed. Ocean is a large body of saltwater, which is made up of water. Humidifiers turn water into a vapor that can be used to humidify the air. Ice cubes are made from freezing water. Water can drip from a faucet or a container. When water freezes on a surface, it can create a skating rink. Therefore, all of the options are correct.
Submarines are typically launched from a body of water, such as a harbor or a bay, because that is where they will be able to begin their underwater journey. Launching a submarine on land or from a shipyard would not be practical or efficient for this purpose. Additionally, using an ICBM missile to launch a submarine would not make sense, as the two are completely different types of weapons/systems.
Final exams are typically associated with the need to prepare and review material beforehand. Studying is the most common way to do this, and is widely known as the most effective way to improve test results. Sweating is not likely to help with exams, and cheating is unethical and can lead to serious consequences. Graduation is a separate event that occurs after exams are taken, and sleeping may be helpful in some cases but is not a guaranteed way to improve exam performance.
The sentence suggests that locking one's knees while standing may cause someone to faint or fall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, it is common knowledge that locking one's knees while standing for a long period of time can cause a decrease in blood flow and lead to fainting or falling.
The sentence suggests that when someone is deeply involved while watching a film, it means that the film is engaging and captivating. The word "deeply involved" implies that the person is emotionally invested in the story, which would only happen if the film is interesting. The other options do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection with the film or a high level of engagement.
The adjective "little" is often used to describe a younger sibling, indicating that the speaker had a good time with their younger brother. The other adjectives have negative connotations and would not be used to describe a positive experience, making "little" the most likely answer.
The sentence indicates that the activity being done while relaxing with friends involves having a conversation or discussion, which is most closely associated with the option "talking about." The other options do not accurately describe the context of the sentence and do not fit the meaning of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person fell, which implies that they are on the ground or have fallen down. The natural thing to do after falling is to get up, so this option is the most logical choice. Receiving letters, crossing the street, giving gifts, and feeling embarrassed are not necessarily related to falling, and therefore would not be the correct answer in this context.
The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating a hamburger with friends, which typically implies a social activity. Eating with friends is often associated with having a good time and enjoying each other's company, which is why "having fun" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "indigestion," "death," "tasty," and "gas," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct.
The sentence suggests that agreeing with someone you have fun with can lead to a positive outcome. The word "harmony" implies a sense of agreement and cooperation, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive outcome or connection with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that humans have a natural inclination to hunt, which is typically done for food. Eating meat is a common practice for humans and is also supported by our teeth and digestive system. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is visiting multiple stores with the intention of buying products. However, the reason for doing so is not immediately clear. Among the options provided, only comparison shopping would make sense in this context. Comparison shopping involves visiting multiple stores to compare prices, features, and quality of products in order to make an informed decision about what to buy. The other options (online shopping, running out of money, debt, overstocking) do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the party is being hosted by a fraternity, as the person is assuring their friends that they can also attend the party. Fraternities are known for hosting parties, particularly on college campuses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Fire extinguishers are typically found in buildings and spaces where a fire could occur, and most businesses are required by law to have them on hand. Boat and apartment may have fire extinguishers on board/in units, but it is unlikely for them to have one in their boardrooms specifically. Public buildings may have them, but not all of them do, and it is less common for them to have one in a boardroom. A chemistry lab would likely have a fire extinguisher as well, but again, it is less likely to be in their boardroom specifically.
The sentence implies that someone has been accused of killing people that another person loves, which suggests that the person who loves the victims may seek revenge or retaliation against the accused. Retaliation is a common reaction to betrayal or harm, especially if the person feels a strong emotional connection to the victims. "Go home", "sadness", "remorse", and "going to jail" are not logical choices for a person's reaction to someone accused of killing their loved ones.
The problem presented in the question is that the person doesn't have pants that fit. The logical solution to this problem would be to buy new clothes that fit properly. The other choices are not relevant or helpful in solving the problem presented in the question.
The sentence suggests that horses require a lot of energy to function properly due to their size and amount of exercise they get. As a result, they need to hydrate themselves properly by drinking water. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as running quickly or pulling a wagon are forms of exercise that horses are already getting, going away is not a solution or a requirement, and eating carrots does not address the issue of hydration.
The question implies that sloths are commonly hunted, so the answer that makes sense is a location where hunting is prohibited or at least discouraged. A nature preserve is a protected area where animals can live without human interference, so it is the most likely option. A forest canopy and a tropical rainforest are both habitats where sloths live, but they do not provide protection from hunting. A zoo is a controlled environment where animals are kept in captivity, so it does not fit the description of a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted. "Commercial" is not a location where sloths would naturally live.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to the improper disposal of trash, which is typically dealt with in a landfill. A landfill is a designated area where waste is buried underground under controlled conditions to prevent pollution and damage to the environment. The other options are either not related to waste disposal (hospital, parking lot) or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (ground).
The question asks about a pool near "your own home," which suggests a private residence rather than a public space like a YMCA or hotel. The option "neighbor's house" is possible, but the most likely answer is "backyard," as many homes have private pools in their backyard for personal use. "Waterfall" does not make sense as an answer, as it is not typically associated with pools in residential areas.
The sentence suggests that there is a group of people on the east coast where there are many skyscrapers. The term "skyscraper" is commonly associated with New York City, as it has the largest number of skyscrapers in the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the students were involved in some kind of performance, as they were building a backdrop for it. Both "theater" and "stage show" are viable options, but "theater" is spelled differently in British English ("theatre"). "Photography studio" and "mini project" do not make sense in the context of building a backdrop for a performance.
Canning is a common method of preserving crops for long periods of time. It involves sealing food in an airtight container, like a can, and then heating the can to destroy any bacteria or microorganisms that might cause spoilage. This process is commonly used for fruits and vegetables, and is a convenient way for farmers to extend the shelf life of their crops. The other options do not involve preserving crops in any way.
Hiking is a popular outdoor activity that is usually associated with mountainous regions. Mountains are often home to a variety of wildlife, including foxes. The other options listed do not typically offer hiking opportunities or the possibility of encountering a fox.
The context suggests that John is trying to make a sale, and he is talking to someone who can help him with that. The fact that he is willing to lower the price also suggests that he is involved in real estate sales, where price negotiations are common. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
Folding chairs are often used as temporary seating options for guests, and the living room is a common place for entertaining guests. The other options do not have the same association with guest accommodation.
The sentence suggests that the journalist had a straightforward approach to their work, and the phrase "see story" implies that they were able to quickly identify the key elements of a story. The phrase "write down" suggests that the journalist would take notes or record their observations in order to write their story later. The other options (sit down, would read, reading, remember) do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence states that the stove had to be moved due to a kitchen remodel, which implies that the stove was temporarily relocated within the same living space. The most likely option from the given choices is the living room, as it is usually the largest open area in a home where a stove could be placed. The other options, such as apartment, friend's house, and restroom, do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not within the same living space. The option of boiling liquids like water is also unrelated since it does not provide a clear answer to where the stove was moved to.
The sentence suggests that the patient resisted doing something that nurses prompted him to do due to his financial situation. One common way for nurses to prompt patients is to remind them to take their medication, which could be expensive if the patient was not able to afford it. The other options do not have a clear connection to being a poor patient or being prompted by nurses.
Hot dogs are a popular food item at many sporting events, such as baseball, football, and basketball games. These events often have concession stands selling hot dogs and other snacks for attendees to enjoy while watching the game. While hot dogs may be sold in some of the other places listed, such as a park or a theme park like Disneyland, they are not typically associated with those locations as strongly as they are with sporting events.
The sentence suggests that the husband received money (alimony) after the divorce. Since he never worked, it can be inferred that the money he received would make him "richer." The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "fancy" suggests a high-end or upscale type of restaurant, which may have strict rules about the types of food and animals that are allowed on their premises. Live crabs are likely seen as messy or disruptive to the dining experience, so they may not be permitted in fancy restaurants. The other options do not provide any clear indication of why live crabs would not be allowed.
Prescription suntan lotion is typically only available through a pharmacy, as it requires a prescription from a doctor. The other options, such as a grocery store or tanning salon, do not typically carry prescription medications. The beach bag and shop options are also unlikely, as they do not refer to a specific type of store or retailer.
The phrase "broken in" suggests that the person wants jeans that have already been worn and have a more comfortable, relaxed fit. Thrift stores are known for selling secondhand clothing, including items that may have already been broken in by their previous owners. Clothing stores may sell new, stiff jeans that have not yet been worn in, and the options of outside and closet don't make sense in the context of the question. Gap is a specific clothing store, but it does not necessarily specialize in selling pre-worn or broken-in clothing.
The sentence suggests that the ficus can potentially damage the floor, which indicates that it is a living plant. The correct answer would be a container, as this is a common way to pot plants in order to protect surfaces from damage. The other options do not have any connection with the context of the sentence: a dictionary is a book, the Middle East is a region, Earth is the planet we inhabit, and a tropical forest is a type of ecosystem.
The question suggests that people have some spare time when washing clothes, which they use to engage in some other activity. Among the options given, watching TV seems like the most plausible option as it is a passive activity that can be done while doing something else. The other options do not seem relevant to washing clothes. Money is unlikely, getting wet is already happening while washing clothes, studying requires concentration and singing is an active activity that may not be feasible while washing clothes.
The context of the sentence suggests that waiting in line may be a solution to avoiding chaos when demand is high. This is because waiting in line creates a structured and orderly way for people to access what they need without pushing or fighting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that humans benefit from taking a break, and specifically mentions feeling relaxed. This suggests that taking a break can help reduce stress and tension, and promote a sense of calm and well-being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be correct.
A chess pawn is a game piece used in the board game chess. Therefore, it would make the most sense to look for it in a store that sells games, such as a game store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, except for toy store which might sell chess sets, but not necessarily individual pieces.
The sentence suggests that Billy and June heard a pleasant sound while driving down the street. The use of the word "lovely" implies that the sound was enjoyable and pleasing to the ear. The other choices are not likely to produce a "lovely" sound while driving down the street. Air, for example, would not produce a sound that could be heard while driving. Movie, concert hall, and school may produce sound, but the context of the sentence suggests that the source of the sound is not in any of those locations.
The sentence implies that when John and Steve compete against each other, the losers feel a negative emotion. Envy is often felt when someone wants what another person has. In this case, the losers may envy the winner's success or skill. Resentment and injury both have negative connotations, but they do not fit the context of the sentence. Pride is a positive emotion and winning or losing is not a specific emotion, making these choices less likely to be correct.
The question asks for the reason why someone would be getting in shape, and the answer that best fits this goal is good health. Regular exercise and physical activity are essential to maintaining good health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. While jogging, exercise, sweat, and feeling better may all be associated with getting in shape, none of them explicitly address the underlying motivation for doing so.
The question suggests that lying about oneself can have multiple negative consequences. Feeling guilty is a common emotional response to lying, as is the likelihood of facing problems or negative repercussions for one's actions. Lying can also lead to getting caught, which can cause hurt feelings for both the liar and the person being lied to. In some cases, lying about oneself can even result in being fired from a job if the lie is discovered. Therefore, all of the answer choices are possible outcomes of lying about oneself.
Suicide is an intentional act of taking one's own life. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be "die" as it accurately describes the intention of the person committing suicide. The other options do not match the context of the question and may even be considered insensitive or inappropriate. Cutting one's wrist is a form of self-harm, and swimming or interruption do not relate to suicide.
The sentence suggests that the person is putting on a façade of happiness, which is commonly expressed through a smile. The word "pretending" implies that the person is not actually feeling happy, but making an effort to appear happy to others. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the activity of working on needlepoint is done near the entrance of your home, which is likely to be a common area such as a livingroom. The other options are less likely to be near the entrance of your home or may not be suitable for working on needlepoint.
The sentence suggests that James is looking for a place with a church, which is typically found in a Christian community. Churches are places of worship for Christians and are usually found in areas where there is a large Christian population. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that potatoes are not raised in town, which indicates that they must be raised in another location. The most likely option is the countryside, as this is where many farms are located and where crops like potatoes are typically grown. Cellars and restaurants are not locations where potatoes are raised, and boiling is a cooking method, not a location.
The sentence suggests that science and another field are often viewed as conflicting or opposing, but many people find comfort in both. The other options, such as history studies, geography, math, and ghosts, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, the relationship between science and religion is often debated and discussed, so it makes sense that religion would be a possible answer.
The sentence suggests that the person being described is not feeling any enthusiasm or energy towards something. Apathy is the lack of emotion or interest in something, which fits the context of the sentence. Detachment and indifference are also related to a lack of emotional attachment, but apathy specifically refers to a lack of feeling. Hesitance and reluctance imply a different emotion of not wanting to do something, rather than simply not feeling any emotion towards it.
The sentence implies that the mammoth is currently extinct, and cloning it would bring it back to life. The term "ancient history" refers to something that happened a long time ago, and since mammoths are extinct, they are considered to be a part of ancient history. The other options do not fit the context as well because "recent" is the opposite of ancient and the other choices do not relate to prehistoric times.
The sentence implies that the troublemaker anticipated a lenient punishment but received a severe or harsh one instead. The words "soft" and "harsh" contrast with each other, making "harsh" the more likely answer. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone has just consumed poison and another person is now taunting them. Given this context, it is logical to assume that the mockingly displayed item is likely to be connected to the poison, such as an antidote to counteract the effects of the poison. The other options, such as consumable, medicine, nutrient, and dosage, do not fit with the context or imply a negative intent on the part of the second person.
Turnstiles are commonly used in locations where access needs to be controlled, such as ticketed events or transportation stations. The fact that this turnstile does not require a ticket suggests that it is likely used at a location where entry is already paid for, such as an amusement park. The other options may require a ticket to be inserted in a turnstile, or may not use turnstiles at all.
The sentence suggests that punishing innocent people with the death penalty is a morally reprehensible act that is likely to cause a negative public reaction. Public outrage is a common response to perceived injustices or violations of basic human rights, and it is likely to be particularly intense in cases where innocent people are put to death. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely consequences of this type of action.
The sentence suggests that the activity involving fingers and hands is related to movement or articulation. "Scratch," "cup water," and "soft" do not involve movement or articulation of the fingers in relation to the hand. "Sign language" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any other context or clues that suggest sign language would be the correct answer. Therefore, "articulate" is the best fit as it means to move the joints of the body, such as the fingers, in a precise and flexible way.
Lettuce is a perishable vegetable that can wilt and spoil easily if not stored properly. The best place to store lettuce is in a refrigerator, which helps to keep it cool and crisp. The other options are not suitable for storing lettuce, as they do not provide the same level of temperature control and protection from moisture that a refrigerator does. The supermarket and farmer's market are places where lettuce is purchased, not stored. The pantry is often too warm and dry for lettuce, and salad is a dish that contains lettuce, but not a storage location.
The question suggests that a person owns a plant, which implies that the plant is likely located inside their home. Since plants require sunlight to grow, it is likely that the person has placed the plant on a windowsill to receive natural sunlight. The other options, such as street, Disneyland, or summer, do not provide any information about where the plant may be located or where sunlight may be falling on it. Grow lights may be used as an alternative to natural sunlight, but it is not mentioned in the question.
The question asks for a positive effect of expressing yourself, which means we should look for an option that has a positive connotation. Empowerment is a positive term that suggests a sense of confidence and control. Expressing yourself can help you feel more in control of your thoughts and feelings, and can give you a sense of empowerment over your life. The other options have negative connotations and are unlikely to be positive effects of expressing yourself.
The sentence implies that Danny is storing something he wants to access easily but doesn't want it in the way. A closet is a logical option because it can be easily accessed but is out of the way. The other choices don't fit because a cellar and a garage are usually not cozy or easily accessible, a car is not a typical storage location, and the post office does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that Sally made purchases that were both fresh and frozen, which suggests that she went to a grocery store or a market to buy food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person is looking for both good bar service and a potential room to stay in afterwards, which is a service typically offered by hotels. The other options, such as train or wedding, do not provide these services. While some motels may offer bar service, they are generally associated with budget accommodations and may not have the same level of amenities as a hotel. Entertainment is also a vague option that may or may not include bar service or accommodations.
Refills are commonly offered at restaurants when customers order beverages such as soda or iced tea. The other options - cup, sky, coffee shop, and stationary store - do not make sense in the context of the question and do not typically involve asking for refills.
To contemn someone means to despise, scorn, or show disrespect for them. Therefore, if you contemn someone, they are unlikely to have your respect. The other options are all related to positive feelings or admiration, which would not be associated with contemning someone.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was thanking each person individually, which would typically involve some kind of physical gesture, such as a handshake. The other options, such as "appreciation" or "feel good", are more abstract and do not involve a physical action. "Happy" and "smile" are also less likely choices because they do not involve direct interaction between people, which is implied by the use of the word "each".
The sentence implies that the person struggles with hand-eye coordination, which would make playing baseball difficult for them. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that reflects the idea of difficulty or challenge. While playing baseball can certainly be fun, popular in Japan, and round (as a ball sport), none of these options accurately reflect the idea of struggle or challenge that is being conveyed in the sentence. Therefore, "a challenge" is the most appropriate answer.
The question is asking about the behavior of water at different temperatures. Water can exist as a solid (ice), liquid, or gas (steam) depending on its temperature. It can also undergo changes such as boiling or freezing at specific temperature points. The other options are unrelated to the topic of water and temperature.
The sentence suggests that if you're moving, the people in the current location will help you forward your mail to your new address. The correct answer must be a location where mail is collected and processed, such as a post office. Envelopes are the items that letters are sent in, but they are not the location where mail is processed. A mailbox or mail box is where mail is delivered, but it is not where it is processed or forwarded. The front door is not a location where mail is processed or delivered, it is the entrance to a building or house.
Plantations were known for their extensive use of slave labor, especially in the Americas during the colonial period. Slaves were often seen as property that could be bought and sold, and their numbers on plantations could outnumber the actual citizens or owners of the land. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not have a clear connection to the use of slave labor.
The question is asking what someone should consider regarding their job before buying a house, implying that the answer has to do with financial stability. "Making money" is the choice that is most directly related to financial stability and the ability to afford a home. The other choices are not as relevant to the financial aspect of buying a house. "Measuring distances" and "examining porch" could be something to consider when evaluating the physical aspects of a house, but they are not directly related to one's job or financial status. "Security" could refer to job security, but it is too vague and does not provide enough context to be a clear answer. "Make home" is not coherent grammatically and does not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the man used his bass fiddle to play something simple and fun for his baby. A nursery rhyme fits this description, as they are often simple and catchy tunes that are enjoyable for children. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - music and jazz band are too general, orchestra is too formal, and music store does not make sense in the context.
Mugs are typically used for hot beverages like coffee and tea, and are usually stored in a cupboard or cabinet in the kitchen near the area where those beverages are brewed or prepared. The other options (bar, containing drink, and refrigerator) are not typical places to store mugs.
Shadows are formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light, causing an absence of light in that area, and creating a shadow. Therefore, to have a shadow, there needs to be a source of light. Bright light is most frequently associated with creating a shadow. None of the other options, such as ground, bridge, sunshine, or beam, are directly involved in forming a shadow.
The sentence suggests that the person did not get what they were after after standing in line for a long time. This could lead to feelings of disappointment, which is a common emotional response when expectations are not met. The other options- frustration, pain, fatigue, and order- do not fit as well with the context of the sentence as disappointment does.
Marmots are typically found in high altitude areas in mountainous regions, which are often referred to as wilderness areas. They are not typically found in jungles or low lying areas, so the choices of "south america" and "jungle" can be eliminated. "Outside" is too vague and doesn't provide any useful information, and "new zealand" is not known for having marmots.
The word "called down" implies that the person was chosen or selected for something, which can often elicit excitement. The fact that they "ran down the aisle" further supports the idea of excitement and anticipation. The other options do not fit well with the context and do not convey the same sense of energy and enthusiasm.
The sentence suggests that the poker player was not making any profit on the night, which means he was losing money instead. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. "Broke" suggests a state of financial distress rather than a specific activity in the context of poker. "Lost" and "loss" are similar to "losing" but are not the most common verb forms used to describe losing in poker. "Waste" does not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence either.
The phrase "goes to work" implies that the person is employed and regularly goes to a workplace to perform their job duties. The other options may be related to the person's morning routine, but do not necessarily indicate whether or not they have a job.
The context suggests that the individual is not impressed by the Eiffel Tower, which is a famous landmark in Paris, France. Therefore, it is likely that they reside in the city where the Eiffel Tower is located, which is Paris, or in the country where the city is located, which is France. The other options, movies, in Europe, and the capital city of France do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, if the sentence said "Where might someone who has never seen the Eiffel Tower before be from?" then the answer would be "movies" because someone who has only seen the Eiffel Tower in movies might not be impressed by it in person.
A billfold is a type of wallet typically used to hold money, credit cards, and identification. The context suggests that the question is asking for the items commonly kept in a billfold. Therefore, the correct answers are likely to be the items that are commonly carried in a billfold. The other options, such as a cell phone or hip pocket, are not typically associated with a billfold. Additionally, the last choice, "man's back pocket," is not an item but a place where a billfold might be carried.
Informational pamphlets are commonly found in places where people go to access information, such as the health department or library. Bookstores may also have informational pamphlets available for topics related to health, self-help, or other informational subjects. Drawers and mailboxes are unlikely places to find informational pamphlets as they are not typically used for distributing informational materials.
The sentence suggests that the kid was fidgeting with things, which is a common behavior when someone is bored. The speaker likely commented on this behavior by stating that the kid was bored. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "vast" suggests that the universe is extremely large, and the word "even" implies that the following adjective should be even more extreme than "vast." "Infinite" means endless or limitless, which is a common way to describe the universe. The other options may also be used to describe the universe, but "infinite" is the most fitting based on the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "paid" and "dining room" suggests a commercial establishment that offers food service. The other options, such as "own home" and "table to eat on" do not necessarily entail payment, while "mansion" does not fit the context of the sentence.
The presence of the word "work" in the sentence suggests that the man is likely in a professional setting, such as an office, where he is drinking his coffee. None of the other options are related to a work or professional setting.
The sentence mentions that the person organized an event to help a friend who was struggling with medical bills. This suggests that the goal of the event was to raise funds to help the friend. Therefore, the correct answer would be "money." The other options may be related to the situation but do not directly answer the question of what the event was meant to raise.
Similes are comparisons using "like" or "as," so we want to find a phrase that compares trees to something positive in the workplace. "Stand together" is a good option because it conveys a sense of unity, teamwork, and solidarity, which are all desirable traits in a workplace environment. The other options are negative or neutral, and do not provide a positive comparison to the workplace.
The question is asking about where astronauts who miss a landing might end up, suggesting that they did not reach their intended destination. The option "spaceship" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would already be in a spaceship to travel to their destination. The option "surface of moon" may be a possibility, but the context of the question suggests that the astronauts are still in space. The option "space shuttle" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would have to be in a shuttle to travel to their destination in the first place. The option "at the" is not a complete sentence and does not make sense in the context of the question. The option "orbit" makes the most sense, as astronauts who miss a landing could end up orbiting the moon, Earth, or another celestial body until they are rescued or can make it back to their intended destination.
The phrase "behind the seat" suggests that the fire extinguisher is located in a type of vehicle, rather than a stationary location like a house or garden. Among the options provided, a school bus is the most likely to have a fire extinguisher located behind the driver's seat or in another easily accessible location. The other options either do not have a clear connection to the context or are less likely to have a fire extinguisher located behind the seat.
The sentence is asking where chicken can be kept fresh for a longer period of time. Among the given options, the freezer is the logical choice since it is designed to preserve food by keeping it at a very low temperature. The other options, such as french fries, a plate, pizza, and a fast food restaurant, do not have any connection to preserving chicken or keeping it fresh for a longer period of time.
The options "opera," "park," "end of line," and "bus depot" do not have any clear connection to the context of people wanting to talk to someone. "Neighbor's house" is the most likely answer as it is a common location for people to gather and socialize.
The sentence suggests that after getting high, the person's memory was affected and they felt like they couldn't remember anything. The word "brainless" implies a lack of thought or intelligence, which seems to fit the context of the sentence. The other options either do not fit the context or are not related to memory loss.
Books are typically stored on a shelf in a home, as this provides a dedicated space for them that is easily accessible. A cabinet or table could also potentially be used for storage, but it is less common. Obesity and backpack have no relevance to the context of the question.
The question is asking for the fastest way to combat being cold, and getting warm is the most direct and effective solution. Lighting a fire and chopping firewood may take time and effort, and making a patchwork quilt may provide some warmth but not immediately. Drinking up may provide a temporary sensation of warmth, but it is not a long-term solution and may not be effective if the person is already shivering or experiencing hypothermia.
The sentence suggests that changing society can have a variety of results. Out of the options given, only "better standard of living" is presented as a positive outcome. "Confusion and chaos," "depression," and "anger and depression will not change the society" are negative outcomes. "Sometimes bad" is too vague to be a clear choice. Therefore, "better standard of living" is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that a smaller ficus can be kept inside, which implies that it can be grown in a container. The word "flowerpot" specifically refers to a container for growing plants indoors and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is seeing a messy house that was clean earlier that day, which implies that the person had a certain expectation of the state of the house. It is reasonable to assume that the person may feel upset or frustrated by the unexpected mess. The other options do not reflect a likely reaction to this scenario.
The sentence implies that starting a fire is a bad idea because of the way flames move. The word "unpredictable" suggests that flames can move in unexpected ways with varying intensity, making it hard to control them and increasing the risk of accidents or injuries. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for why starting a fire would be a bad idea.
The sentence suggests that the person was stuck in traffic on the way to a movie audition. Since auditions for movies typically take place in cities with a lot of film production, the correct answer is likely to be a large city. The other options do not provide any context clues that suggest the person was in a city or on their way to an audition.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about places where alcoholic refreshments are not allowed or restricted. Schools are typically designated as alcohol-free zones to provide a safe environment for students, which is why alcoholic refreshments are sometimes banned in these public places. The other options are not necessarily designated as alcohol-free zones, although some may have their own policies regarding the consumption of alcohol on their premises.
The question is asking for a reason why people eat food, even if they do not like it. The option "necessary to live" is the only one that provides a logical explanation for why people eat food. Humans need to eat in order to survive and obtain the nutrients that their bodies need to function properly. The other options are either irrelevant or do not provide a convincing explanation for the question.
Combustible materials are those that are capable of catching fire and burning. Applying a heat source to these materials with ill intentions could easily result in a fire. Burns and damage are possible consequences of a fire, but they are not the direct result of applying a heat source to combustible materials. Going to jail is a consequence of committing a crime, but it is not necessarily related to the act of applying a heat source to combustible materials. Warmth is a consequence of applying heat, but it does not accurately describe the potential danger or damage that could occur.
The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is likely a region that includes both plains and mountains. Middle America is a region that includes parts of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, and is known to have a diverse landscape that includes both plains and mountains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A river typically flows through a valley, which is a low area of land between hills or mountains. Wisconsin is a state and not a feature that rivers flow through. Wilderness refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered by human activity, but a river can flow through a wilderness area or any type of environment. A bridge is a structure that crosses over a river, but a river does not flow through a bridge. A waterfall is a natural feature that forms where a river or stream flows over a steep drop in elevation, but a river does not flow through a waterfall.
The word "twist" suggests that the cord was tangled or twisted, and the phrase "tried to do what to it" indicates that the person was attempting to fix or manipulate the cord in some way. "Unravel" means to separate or untangle something that is twisted or tangled, which makes it the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "happy" suggests a positive emotion, which can be connected to the feeling of fulfillment. The man is seeing his idea become a reality, which can bring a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. The other options such as pain, excitement, inspiration, and manual do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
To see an extreme closeup of a potato, one would need to use an optical device such as a microscope or magnifying glass. The other options, such as a grocery store or pantry, do not provide a means of viewing a potato up close. A garden patch may allow one to view a potato from a closer distance, but not at an extreme closeup level. Vegetable stew is simply a dish that may contain potatoes, but it does not allow for a direct viewing of the vegetable.
The sentence suggests that the people were building a backdrop for a play, which is commonly associated with a live theatrical performance. The mention of tools echoing in the empty space further supports this idea, as a theatre would have a large open space for building sets and props. The other options, such as bodyshop and photography studio, do not have any clear connection to building a stage backdrop.
The question asks about someone's "favorite text," which implies that it is a personal item that they value highly. It would make sense for someone to keep their favorite text in their own home where they have easy access to it and can ensure its safekeeping. The other options (book store, newspaper, library, novel) do not necessarily suggest a personal connection to the text or ownership of it.
The sentence implies that being alone can lead to a specific emotion or feeling, and loneliness is the most appropriate option that describes this outcome. Feeling lonely is a common psychological response to being isolated or disconnected from others, and the other options do not relate to the emotional implications of being alone. Graduating from high school, entering college, or crossing the street are all unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Certain foods can trigger symptoms, and hamburgers are often high in fat and difficult to digest, which could cause indigestion for someone with Crohn's disease. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not relevant to the symptoms of Crohn's disease.
The sentence suggests that the hard-working man was injured and became stuck at home. Despite this, he tried to keep busy by doing housework, which had negative consequences. The answer "pain and suffering" is the best choice as it relates directly to the idea that the man's injury caused him to experience physical pain and emotional distress. The other options do not fully capture the severity of the situation described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person has a product they want to showcase at a trade show. The word "finally" implies that they have been preparing for this event for some time. The word "show off" suggests that they want to demonstrate the product's capabilities or unique features. Therefore, the correct answer would likely involve showcasing or demonstrating the product, which is option D, "demonstration." The other options, such as store, shelf, market, and dance, do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the people in question only have a "bit" of hunger, which suggests that they are not experiencing extreme hunger or starvation. Therefore, options like starvation and anger can be ruled out. The sentence also implies that the hunger is not severe enough to require immediate action, like having lunch or eating, which eliminates those options as well. Discomfort is the most appropriate choice, as it indicates a mild sensation of physical or emotional unease.
The sentence suggests that the football player is having difficulty breathing, which is related to the amount of oxygen he is taking in. The player puts on a mask, which can help him increase oxygen intake by filtering out pollutants and increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air he breathes. The other options do not relate to the specific context of the football game and the player's physical condition.
The sentence implies that one of the reasons people talk is to communicate information with each other, which is best represented by the choice "sharing information." The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence - "obtaining information" and "exchange of ideas" could be considered similar to sharing information, but they do not capture the basic nature of why people talk. "Nose" and "dry mouth" are completely unrelated to the topic of conversation.
The sentence suggests that cats enjoy a specific type of activity, and the answer choice "play with toys" is the only option that fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, cats are known for being playful and curious animals, and playing with toys is a common way for them to engage in these behaviors.
The sentence suggests that the child did something wrong at the dinner table that resulted in them being given a warning. The only choice that is related to the context is "reach over," as it is a common table etiquette rule to not reach over someone's plate to get food. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question refers to the interaction between customers and a waiter in a restaurant, suggesting that the customers are paying the waiter for their services. "Pay to" is the only option that fits this context, as it indicates that customers pay money to the waiter. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence indicates that the pitcher is getting ready to act, which suggests that they will be performing a specific action related to their position in baseball. In baseball, the pitcher throws the ball to the batter, making "throwing" the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in this context - "lose" and "injury" are unrelated, "competition" is not a way of delivering the ball, and "rolled" is not typically how a pitcher would deliver a pitch.
The sentence suggests that there are disagreements happening within the team, but these disagreements are constructive in nature. The phrase "argue constructively" implies that the disagreements are being handled in a productive manner. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as they are either irrelevant or do not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.
The question suggests that the monitor wall is used for visualizing sounds, which is a common feature in recording and music studios. Studios often use monitor walls to display audio levels and track waveforms in real-time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The term "soprano" is often used to describe the highest range of female singing voice. In church, a soprano singer would typically be a member of the choir, which is a group of singers who perform together as part of the religious service. The other options do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence or to the role of a soprano in a church setting.
The sentence suggests that Sarah has a condition, but she still thinks she can do the work. However, the condition has taken something away from her, which is indicated by the phrase "robbed her of." Strength refers to physical or mental power and energy, which could be affected by a medical condition, and could explain why Sarah might not consider herself disabled, as she is still capable of performing tasks. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the viola is played alongside many other types of instruments, which is a characteristic commonly associated with orchestras. Orchestras are large groups of musicians who play a variety of instruments, including strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. A string quartet, on the other hand, only includes four string instruments (two violins, a viola, and a cello), while a symphony is a musical composition that is typically played by an orchestra. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that people own multiple pairs of jeans and store them somewhere in their home. A closet is a common storage space for clothing, including jeans. The other options - gap, mailbox, shopping mall, thrift store - are not typically used as storage spaces for personal belongings.
The sentence implies that spare pencils were provided for students to use in case they did not have their own. It also suggests that this was a common practice and that it was important for instruction to continue without interruption. Therefore, the likely location for the spare pencils would be in the classroom where they are easily accessible to the students. The other options may also have pencils, but they do not specifically relate to the context of the sentence.
Parties are typically associated with a fun and social atmosphere, where people gather to enjoy each others' company. The use of drugs or having babies at a party would not be appropriate or considered desirable by most people, while meeting new people is a possibility but not necessarily a given. Laughter, on the other hand, is a common sound heard at parties as people joke, dance, and chat with each other.
The phrase "across the pond" is a colloquial expression commonly used to refer to traveling from the United States to the United Kingdom (which are separated by the Atlantic Ocean). The sentence suggests that the artist's next art gallery was in a city located in the UK, and the only option out of the ones given that is in the UK is London. The other options are either locations in the United States or do not specify a location.
The term "star" is often used to refer to celestial objects that are visible in the night sky, which suggests that the answer relates to this context. The other choices, such as press conference or globular cluster, do not typically involve stars, whereas the Milky Way and heavens are broader terms that could refer to a variety of celestial objects or locations. Therefore, the correct answer must be the option that specifically relates to the visibility of stars.
The sentence suggests that the large clock is located outdoors, which eliminates options such as desk or shelf. The choice of words "large clock" also implies that it is a public or commercial space, which narrows down the options to office building or house. However, it is more likely to find large clocks outside office buildings, such as clock towers or building facades, than in residential homes. Therefore, the correct answer is office building.
The sentence suggests that the restaurant is not doing well in the countryside, indicating that there may not be enough people or demand for its services. Moving to a town could potentially bring in more customers as towns tend to have a larger population and more amenities. The other options do not provide any clear solution to the problem stated in the sentence.
The question asks for a specific location where a sitting policeman can be found. The context suggests that the person is looking for a policeman who is not actively patrolling or performing duties, but is instead sitting down. The most likely place for a sitting policeman to be found is in an office, where they may be completing paperwork, taking a break, or meeting with colleagues. The other options do not provide a clear indication of where a seated policeman might be located.
Assembly lines are commonly used in manufacturing to put together machines and other products. The other options (street, laundromat, laboratory) do not have any connection to the context of the question and are unlikely to be the answer. A big building could potentially be where assembly lines are located, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
Pinatas are typically filled with small toys and candies that are meant to spill out when the pinata is broken. In some cultures, pinatas are also used for celebratory events such as birthdays and weddings, and the tradition of breaking open the pinata is seen as a symbol of abundance and good fortune. Contraceptives, well fed, and owning a house do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, while fairness is not a typical item found inside a pinata.
The sentence implies that the object is a body of water that can be crossed with a canoe. The options "mountain stream," "lake," "boat house," and "campground" do not necessarily require a canoe to cross, while "water" is a general term that encompasses all bodies of water.
Jellyfish are aquatic animals, meaning they live in water. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to water. The options "cartoon" and "Japanese restaurant" have no connection to the natural habitat of a jellyfish. While some species of jellyfish may be found in specific regions like the Pacific Ocean or Red Sea, they can also be found in other bodies of saltwater. However, the one location that applies to all jellyfish species is that they live underwater.
The question is asking about actions someone might take to show their commitment to a loved one. "Taking an oath" is often associated with making a formal promise or commitment, such as in a marriage or other significant partnership. The other options, while potentially part of a committed relationship, do not necessarily demonstrate the same level of formal and intentional commitment as taking an oath.
The sentence suggests that the man collected old appliances and metal throughout the day, which are items commonly found in a junkyard or scrapyard. These businesses specialize in buying and recycling scrap metal, which is why the man would have taken his collection there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to playing with a ball that has grass attached to it, which is likely to be a soccer ball. A soccer field is a place where people play soccer, and it typically has a grass surface. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that all people have a certain commonality. "Everybody is their own" implies that everyone is unique in their own way, but "all people are" indicates that there is something that ties us all together. "Human" is the best choice because it is the one option that applies to all people. The other options are either too specific or do not apply to every individual.
The word "instituting civil action left and right" suggests that the government was taking legal action against many people or groups. The phrase "the people fought back" indicates that they did not agree with these actions and resisted in some way. The word "riot" implies a violent reaction, which would be a likely response to widespread and aggressive government action against citizens. The other options (going to jail, restitution, court case) suggest more passive or legal responses to government action, which do not fit with the idea of "fighting back."
The sentence suggests that the nurse is prioritizing the treatment of wounds based on their severity. The most logical way to prioritize wounds by severity is to rank them based on how much harm they cause to the injured person's body. The other options do not make sense in this context - battle and emergency room suggest a location instead of a person, while food and body are not related to the topic of wounds and medical treatment.
Inflation refers to the general increase in prices and decrease in purchasing power of a currency over time. This means that as inflation increases, the cost of goods also increases, making it more expensive for people to buy the same items. If James wants the government to fight inflation, it suggests that he believes a higher inflation rate would negatively impact his financial situation. One possible reason for this is that inflation can lower the standard of living, making it harder for people to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. The other options do not directly relate to the negative effects of inflation.
When deep in a cave, it is typically dark and difficult to see. Therefore, a source of light would be necessary to find one's way out. The other options (deepfelt, high, frivolous, mountain) do not provide any guidance or assistance in navigating through a cave.
The question is asking about what a friend will do for you, which implies a sense of support and dependability. "Rely on" suggests that a friend can be trusted to provide help or assistance when needed. "Coming home" and "writing a letter" are specific actions that a friend might take, but they do not necessarily capture the essence of what a friend will do for you. "Keep secret" implies that a friend can be trusted with confidential information and is related but not directly answering the question.
The word "perennial" refers to plants that live for more than two years, and often bloom for several years in a row. This suggests that the flowers being referred to in the question are those that bloom repeatedly, and do not die after just one season. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The context of the sentence implies that the sound she heard was likely a part of the ambient sounds of the environment she was in. Chinatown is a neighborhood in New York City known for its distinctive cultural identity, including the use of traditional Chinese instruments such as gongs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the cultural identity of New York City.
The sentence indicates that the character was feeling negative emotions and turned to prayer as a way to improve his mood. The phrase "seemed to begin to make him" suggests that the act of praying had a positive effect and made him feel better. The other options (religiosity, relief, and safe) do not necessarily indicate an improvement in mood, and "feeling better" is the most direct and fitting option.
The options "hockey rink," "arcade," and "ice hockey game" do not make sense because a puck is typically used for playing ice hockey, and it is not customary to take home equipment from a game or rink. "Locker room" may seem like a possible option, but it wouldn't make sense to simply take a puck from a locker room unless the context of the question suggests otherwise. A "sporting goods store" is a logical option because it is where sports equipment is sold, and it is likely that one could purchase a puck from there to take home.
The question suggests that love is not able to conquer something related to the life-cycle. It is known that death is a natural part of the life-cycle and is often seen as something that cannot be conquered or overcome. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
TV studios often use milk as a substitute for water when filming certain scenes, such as in cereal commercials or scenes where it is necessary to have liquid in a container. Milk can be used to create the appearance of water without the risk of spillage, and also adds a slight creamy or opaque quality to the liquid on screen. The other options are not commonly associated with the use of milk in TV studios.
The name "Balthazar" has a French origin, which suggests that the restaurant may have a French theme or cuisine. Additionally, the answer options are all locations, and only "manhattan" is a city, which is a common location for restaurants. "Wine" and "underwater" do not make sense as locations for a restaurant, and "quebec" and "montreal" are Canadian cities, which do not fit with the French theme suggested by the name.
The word "round" is the most common and simplest way to describe the shape of a ball. It is a familiar vocabulary word for young children and is often used in everyday language when describing objects that are circular. While the other options are also related to the shape of a ball, they are less commonly used in everyday conversation and may be more associated with scientific or technical descriptions.
The context of the sentence suggests that John opened something that he expected to contain food and was disgusted to find mold. The options "refrigerator," "breadbox," and "cellar" might all contain food, but they are not typically associated with holding pizza. "Carpet" is also unlikely because it would not typically contain food, especially not pizza with mold. The option "pizza box" is the most likely because it is specifically designed to hold pizza, and it is not uncommon for mold to grow on leftover pizza that has not been refrigerated properly.
The word "amphitheatre" refers to a type of venue or structure that was commonly used for entertainment purposes in ancient times, particularly in ancient Greece and Rome. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the country that is historically associated with the use of amphitheatres, which is Greece. The other options - movie house, underground, park, and outside - do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A maze is a structure specifically designed to contain many passageways that form a complex puzzle for those who enter. A house, hotel, jungle, or labyrinth do not typically contain multiple passageways in the same way a maze would, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the critic's opinion and the public's opinion of the movie. The critic found it mediocre, which implies that it was not outstanding or exceptional. However, the public disagreed with the critic and called him jaded, which suggests that they found the movie to be great or remarkable in some way. The other options may also suggest positive qualities, but they do not necessarily imply a contrast with the critic's opinion or an explanation for why the public called him jaded.
The question suggests that the person is looking for a way to entertain themselves when bored, and the options all relate to different activities that could be used for this purpose. Of the choices given, "surf net" is the most likely answer as it is a common activity people use to pass time when they are bored. Watching TV or hanging out with friends are also common options, but they may not always be available or desirable in every situation. Going somewhere or making a patchwork quilt are less likely choices as they require more effort and time than the other options.
The sentence suggests that the package was not delivered, likely because no one was available to receive it. This implies that the carrier attempted to make the delivery and was unsuccessful, and as a result, they would need to either try again at a later time or have the recipient pick up the package themselves. Of the given options, "pick up" is the most appropriate and makes logical sense in this context. The other options do not fit the situation described in the sentence.
Baking typically involves cooking food in an oven using heat. Therefore, it is logical to assume that an unbaked cake should be placed in an oven to be baked. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - a refrigerator is too cold and a trash can obviously isn't a place to store food. A bakery or a birthday party also do not make sense as places to put an unbaked cake, as these are events or locations related to serving baked goods.
Boredom can result from a lack of stimulation or interest, and playing chess is often perceived as a slow and methodical game that requires a lot of concentration and patience. This can lead to boredom for some people who prefer more fast-paced or dynamic activities. The other options - being funny or learning/seeing new things - are less likely to cause boredom, while surfing the internet can be engaging or distracting for some people.
The job of a conductor is to direct an orchestra, which is a large ensemble of instrumentalists playing together. The gong is a percussion instrument commonly used in orchestral music, so it stands to reason that the gong player would be playing with an orchestra. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence - Tibet, Chinatown, and music store are not likely to have gong players or orchestras, and "band" could apply to many different types of musical groups.
The sentence suggests that the man played games as a way to unwind after work. The word "unwind" suggests a need to destress or relax, so it can be inferred that the effect of playing games was to help him relax. The other options may also be associated with playing games, but they do not specifically address the effect that playing games had on the man in this particular context.
The question is asking for a location where water cannot be seen. In a steam room, water is heated to the point where it becomes steam or water vapor, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. The other options do not fit the criteria of water being present but not visible - crushed ice is visible as chunks, north and tidal waves refer to locations/directions rather than water visibility, and the surface of the earth may have bodies of visible water.
The sentence states that all delis in Bobby's location are kosher, which narrows down the options to a place where kosher food is prevalent. Germany and Jerusalem may have kosher food options, but there is no indication that all delis in those places are kosher. "Food court" is a location rather than a city or town. "Town" is too general and could apply to many places, but "New York City" is specifically known for having a large Jewish population and many kosher food options, making it the most likely choice.
The sentence suggests that the person who gets drunk while on stairs is at risk of experiencing a physical mishap. "Falling down" is the most appropriate option as stairs are often associated with falling incidents, and alcohol can impair balance and coordination. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a reason why someone would commit murder, and "problems" is a broad and general answer that could encompass a variety of motivations such as financial difficulties, mental illness, personal grievances, or relationship issues. The other options are not necessarily related to committing a crime and do not provide reasonable explanations for murder. Going to jail would be a consequence of committing a criminal act, but it does not explain why someone would intentionally take someone's life. Guilty conscience and finding god are possible outcomes after committing murder, but they are not reasons for doing so. A knife is a tool that could be used to commit murder, but it does not provide insight into the perpetrator's motives.
The fact that the sentence mentions pizza alone suggests that the fast food restaurant that the tourist went to was likely a pizza chain. Of the options given, New York is known for its many famous pizza chains, such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that not having many belongings means that the person does not have a lot of material items. Possessing is the correct answer because it means "to have or own something", which is the opposite of not having many belongings. Sufficient and enough are related to quantity or amount, but do not necessarily indicate ownership or possession. Plethora means "an excessive amount" and lackbrain is not a proper word.
Bees are known to be attracted to wildflowers, which are typically found in natural settings such as fields, meadows, and other rural areas. The term "countryside" refers to these types of settings, making it the most likely answer. The other options, such as the United States or the beach, do not have the same association with wildflowers and bees.
When trees are dry, they lack moisture and are unable to obtain the nutrients they need to survive. Thus, it is likely that they will die. The other options are unlikely because they do not directly relate to the problem of the trees being dry. For example, trees that branch out or stand together could be healthy or not.
The verb "used" suggests that the clothing needs to be washed or cleaned, and the best place to put it in that context would be a hamper, which is commonly used for collecting dirty clothes. The other options do not make sense in this context - a person or a house are not places to put clothing, "check" is not a common use of the verb in this context, and a backpack is unlikely to be the place where clothing that needs washing would be stored.
The sentence suggests that there is a location where one can find thousands of bus stations, which indicates a highly populated and busy area. The other choices, such as maps and streets, are not specific locations that would have a large number of bus stations. Portland may have multiple bus stations, but it does not necessarily have thousands, and the city center alone would not account for such a high number of bus stations.
The sentence implies that Randy is craving a specific type of food, a hamburger. It suggests that he is not concerned about additional toppings or ingredients, which could suggest that this is a simple, basic craving. The other options do not clearly connect with the context of the sentence.
The term "rivalry" suggests a competitive relationship where both parties are trying to outdo each other. This can often lead to negative feelings between the competitors, as each is trying to come out on top. The other choices, such as winning or losing, accomplishment, achievements, and death, do not necessarily imply a negative relationship between the two individuals competing.
The sentence suggests that the farmer wants to grow cotton in a location close to Florida. Georgia is a state that borders Florida and is known for its cotton production, making it the best option among the choices given. Orlando is a city in Florida and not a suitable location for cotton farming. Fabric and medicine cabinet are not related to the question, and North Carolina is further away from Florida than Georgia.
The question is asking for what can lead to a better understanding. Increasing one's knowledge is a clear way to gain a better understanding of a topic. The other options, such as an interest in something or having ideas or wisdom, may contribute to better understanding as well, but increasing knowledge is the most direct and specific answer to the question. A coffee table is not relevant to the question.
The question is asking about a place where a child might be happy to find chocolate. The options "nearby" and "box" do not refer to a specific location where chocolate can be found. While chocolate can be found in a supermarket, it is not a place that a child would typically associate with happiness or excitement. On the other hand, a candy store is a place specifically dedicated to selling candy, including chocolate, which might be a place where a child would be happy to find chocolate. Similarly, a Christmas stocking is often filled with small treats and gifts, including chocolate, so this could also be a correct answer.
The options concert, theater, and opera are not devices, but rather venues where events are held. Microwave is a kitchen appliance and not designed to play video content. Television is a device that can be used to watch programs from the comfort of one's home, making it the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the woman's love for someone is not reciprocated, and she is looking at him with a sense of longing. The phrase "want to be" implies that she wants to have some significance or value in his eyes. "Matter to" fits this context as it means to be important to someone or to be significant to them. The other choices, such as "get money from" or "go to college," do not make sense in this context.
Sneezing is a reflex action that occurs in response to irritation in the nasal passages, and is triggered by the inhalation of air. This explains why the correct answer is "inhale". The other options, such as "fart", "close eyes", "spray" and "blow nose" are not related to sneezing and hence are incorrect.
In a house, it is common to have a doorbell or bell located near the front entrance so visitors can announce their arrival. This is often used in place of knocking or yelling to get the attention of someone inside. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "delicious" suggests that the person enjoyed their lunch, and feeling satisfied is a common reaction to enjoying a meal. Becoming tired or getting sleepy might happen after consuming a heavy or large meal, but it is not necessarily associated with a delicious lunch. Feeling full is a possibility, but it does not convey the enjoyment of the meal in the same way as feeling satisfied. Getting fear is not a common or logical response to having a delicious lunch, so that option can be eliminated.
The question suggests that adding hydrogen to something can cause an explosion, which is a phenomenon commonly studied in chemistry labs. In labs, hydrogen is often used in experiments and reactions that can produce explosive results. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James has a negative perception of relationships and believes that loving another person will lead to jealousy. This may imply that James has had negative experiences with relationships in the past or has a fear of being hurt by another person's actions. The other options, such as satisfaction or happiness, are less likely because they do not align with James's negative perception of relationships.
The question is asking for the final phase of a living being's life, which is commonly understood to be death. The other options do not accurately describe the final phase of life, although decay may be a part of the process leading up to death. Respiration and growing older are ongoing processes that occur throughout a living being's life, while "sometimes bad" is a vague and unclear option without any clear connection to the context of the question.
Asexual reproduction is a process in which single cell organisms can create new generations without the need for a partner. This is done through methods such as binary fission, budding, or fragmentation. The other answer choices are not related to the process of reproduction and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence implies that sitting quietly is a deliberate action that involves some form of mental focus or relaxation. Meditating is a commonly practiced technique for achieving a state of quiet mindfulness. The other options may involve being quiet, but do not necessarily require an intentional focus on relaxation or mindfulness.
The context of the sentence suggests that the mascot gathered the children around the campfire, which is a common activity associated with toasting marshmallows and making s'mores. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John is looking for molecules, which are the building blocks of substances. Therefore, it is most likely that John would look for molecules in a substance. The other options (elements, anything, air, hands) do not specifically relate to the concept of molecules or their location.
The Bible contains many references to trees, including apple trees. The mention of an apple tree suggests that the question is related to a religious or moral context, as the apple tree is often used as a symbol for knowledge or temptation in the Bible. The other options, such as New York or Spain, do not have any clear association with apple trees or the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that skiing is risky and can cause a serious consequence. The word "accident" is a common term used to describe a negative event that occurs unexpectedly, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately represent the severity of the situation described in the sentence. Although falling down, falling in, getting cold, and tripping and falling could all be negative consequences of skiing, they do not convey the seriousness suggested by the sentence.
The sentence indicates that James is concerned about safety when playing games, suggesting a fear of harm or danger. The phrase "loss of life" directly relates to this fear, as it represents the potential for an extreme and irreversible consequence of an unsafe game. The other options do not reflect the seriousness or danger implied in the sentence.
The term "tabby" refers to a type of cat coat pattern that involves stripes or spots, and is a trait that can be found in many domesticated cats. The sentence suggests that this type of cat is often found in a specific location when resting, which is on someone's lap. This is a behavior that is commonly seen in cats that are comfortable and familiar with their owner or caretaker, and is not typically associated with the other options provided.
The use of the word "tropical" suggests that the river is flowing into a region known for its high biodiversity and dense vegetation, which is commonly associated with the Amazon basin. The other options do not fit the description of a tropical forest or a region known for high biodiversity. Channels may be associated with water flow, but do not suggest any particular location, while countryside and national parks may not have the necessary environmental conditions for a tropical forest. Temperate zones, by definition, are not tropical.
The sentence suggests that the question is asking about how living things continue their species, which can be interpreted as how they procreate or produce offspring. The word "reproducing" directly relates to this idea. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the question, as "communing" refers to socializing, "palpitations" refers to heartbeats, "perspiration" refers to sweating, and "respiration" refers to breathing.
The sentence suggests that the speaker hasn't had rest recently, which implies that they may be feeling fatigued or tired. The option "exhausted" best captures this sense of extreme tiredness. The other options, such as "rested" or "muscles tired," do not convey the same level of fatigue as "exhausted." "Worked all day" may be a contributing factor to the speaker's exhaustion, but it does not necessarily capture the full extent of their tiredness.
The sentence implies that work is difficult, which can make one appreciate moments of rest or leisure. "Relaxation" is the most fitting choice among the options provided, as it relates directly to the idea of finding relief from the daily grind of work. "Unemployment" and "do nothing" are not necessarily positive states, and "earn money" is not a direct contrast to the idea of work being challenging. "Sleeping" may provide some relief, but it does not capture the idea of enjoying leisure time.
The sentence implies that Bob bought a property, which suggests that the secret passageway was likely part of a building or structure. The other options, such as airport, hotel, or shopping mall, do not typically have private residences with secret passageways. Therefore, the most likely answer is "house."
The question is asking where to store jewelry if you do not plan to use it soon. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, including jewelry, when they are not being used or worn. A lady's boudoir or bedroom drawer may be common places to store jewelry at home, but they may not be as secure as a safe deposit box. A suitcase is not a secure or recommended storage option for valuable items. A department store is not an appropriate storage location as it is a retail establishment, not a storage facility.
The fact that the dog is able to escape regularly suggests that it is intelligent and perhaps resourceful. Dogs that are highly intelligent may be more prone to escaping because they have a greater awareness of their surroundings and are curious about exploring beyond their normal boundaries. The other options (loyal, tired, friendly, faithful) do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not necessarily linked to a dog that escapes regularly.
A fitting room is a space within a store where customers can try on clothing before making a purchase. While some clothing retailers such as Gap and malls may also offer fitting rooms, the term "department store" specifically refers to a large retail store that sells a wide range of products including clothing, accessories, and home goods. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely department store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the worker is experiencing negative health effects due to poor ventilation, which is a common cause of headaches. Headaches can be a symptom of exposure to fumes and other hazardous substances in the workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for something that is used to pronounce parts of a letter, indicating that it must be related to sound or speech. Out of the given choices, "syllable" is the only option that refers to a unit of sound in a word, which can be pronounced individually. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the answer is related to how humans are born, and specifically mentions two ways. Male and female are the two primary biological sexes that humans are born as, which makes them the correct answer. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, with emotional, adaptable, and selfish being personality traits, and left or right handedness being a physical characteristic that is not related to how humans are born.
The word "opaque" means that something is not transparent and does not allow light to pass through, which would make it difficult to see through a clear medium. The other options do not accurately describe a situation where a clear medium would be hard to see through, suggesting the correct answer is "opaque."
The sentence suggests that there are various attractions, such as tickets, rides, and games, but the real money is made in food sales, which implies that this is a location where people tend to spend a lot of money on food. This is a common characteristic of fairgrounds, which are known for their extensive food offerings and the high prices that vendors often charge for their products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking about finding homes that are not attached to each other, which is a characteristic commonly found in neighborhoods or areas in cities or towns that are zoned for single-family homes. Denver and Michigan are specific locations and do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. An apartment building would typically have attached units rather than stand-alone homes.
The other options do not relate to the process of obtaining food in the same way as "buy food." Making food and preparing food require ingredients, which would have to be obtained somehow. Although finding food in the wild is a possibility, the sentence suggests that the person is actively seeking a solution to their hunger rather than relying on chance. Checking a cat's mouth has nothing to do with procuring food for oneself.
The sentence suggests that the person is dissatisfied with the unequal distribution of cake slices. The word "demand" implies they are seeking some sort of resolution or change. "Fairness" is the most logical choice as it addresses the issue of unequal distribution. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the reading material is intended to aid in sleep, which is a common reason people read before bed. The option "learn new things" suggests that the reading material is educational and not necessarily conducive to sleep. "Memorize" is also not typically associated with bedtime reading, and "waking up" and "having fun" are typically associated with activities that occur during the day.
The sentence suggests that there is something that typically goes under furniture, which can be inferred to be a type of floor covering. A rug is a type of floor covering often used to protect floors from scratches and damage caused by furniture legs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the boy is popular but at the same time considered strange because of his interests. The word "weirdo" is a common colloquial term for someone who seems odd or eccentric. "Nerdy" and "geek" suggest an interest in academic or intellectual pursuits, while "disliked" and "unknown" do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that going for a run has some specific benefit which is not related to illness. One potential benefit of running that is often cited is weight loss, so this choice is likely the correct answer. Breathlessness and satisfaction could be side effects of running, but they do not directly explain why someone would choose to go for a run if they are not ill. Mouth wash and better health are not related to running in any obvious way.
The phrase "make time" is commonly associated with setting aside or creating blocks of time in one's schedule to meet or spend time with someone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of wanting to see someone.
The sentence suggests that the police had been unable to solve the case for years, and the family hired a private investigator in the hope of uncovering the truth. The other options suggest actions that the police or investigator could take in order to solve the case, but none of them specifically address the hope of uncovering the truth. Additionally, "gathering facts" and "gathering evidence" are similar to each other and are not distinct enough options to be both correct.
The question mentions a toilet "flying outside the atmosphere," which refers to space travel. The only option related to space travel is the space shuttle, which is a spacecraft designed to carry astronauts and equipment into space. The other options have no connection to the context of the question.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath, which is a serious crime. When someone is found guilty of perjury, it typically brings shame upon them as they have been proven to have intentionally lied in a court of law. The other options do not fit as well as shame in this context, as they are not as closely associated with the social and personal implications of being found guilty of perjury.
A mall is known as a shopping center that typically has many different stores, including clothing stores. The context of the question suggests that the clothing sellers are in the same place, which fits the description of a mall. The other options do not have many clothing sellers in one place. A backpack is used for carrying items, a yard sale is where individuals sell used items from their homes, and a closet is a storage space for clothing. A department store may have clothing sections, but it may not have many clothing sellers in one place.
The sentence suggests that the two groups of people want to vacation somewhere else without paying for it, which implies that they are considering exchanging their respective vacation spots. This is commonly referred to as a "house swap" or "house exchange," where two parties agree to let each other stay in their homes for a specified period of time. None of the other options offer a viable solution for how the two groups can achieve their goal of vacationing somewhere else for free.
The sentence suggests that humans have a long digestive tract, which is an important organ system responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. However, it also implies that there comes a point where something needs to be eliminated from the body, which is the process of excretion. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unrelated to the digestive tract.
The sentence suggests that fraternal twins can result in offspring of different genders. This is because fraternal twins come from two separate eggs that are fertilized by different sperm, whereas identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos. Therefore, it is possible to have a daughter and a son when mothers give birth to fraternal twins. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Bald eagles are primarily found in North America, and their habitat ranges from Alaska down to Mexico. Western North America is a more specific location where bald eagles can be found in significant numbers. The other choices do not provide a specific enough location for finding bald eagles, except for possibly "eagle's nest" or "aerie", which indicate potential locations where bald eagles build their nests, but not necessarily where they are commonly found.
The question is asking for something that requires a queen to remain inhabited, which limits the options to organisms or groups with a hierarchical structure. A beehive is an example of this, as the queen bee is responsible for laying eggs and reproducing, and without her, the colony would eventually die out. The other options do not have a hierarchical structure or do not depend on a specific individual to maintain inhabitability.
The question is asking about the purpose of collecting toll road payments. Toll road payments are typically used to fund the maintenance and repair of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Therefore, the correct answer is "good repair," as this choice best describes the purpose of toll road payments. The other options do not relate to the topic of toll road payments or road maintenance.
When an army is sent abroad to combat zones, it suggests that they are being sent to engage in military operations. The term "combat zones" specifically refers to areas of conflict, such as battlefields or war zones. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be what an army would be doing in a combat zone.
The sentence indicates that Johnny's mom had hidden cookies from him, which suggests that they are located somewhere in the house. The word "jar" implies a container in which cookies could be stored, making it the most likely option for Johnny to search for the cookies his mom hid. The other options have no clear association with cookies or the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the jeweler was impressed by the quality of the diamonds, specifically focusing on one particular characteristic. The word "clear" is often used in the context of diamond quality to describe the absence of inclusions or blemishes, which can affect the transparency and overall appearance of a diamond. The other options may also describe desirable characteristics of diamonds, but they do not specifically relate to the aspect of quality that the jeweler was impressed with.
After eating, the body redirects blood flow to the digestive system to aid in the digestion process. This can result in a decrease in blood flow to the brain, leading to feelings of drowsiness or lethargy. Feeling full may also cause discomfort or a decrease in physical activity, but it is unlikely to lead to falling down. Being late for work or feeling sleepy may be unrelated to the act of eating lunch.
An armoire is a type of large wardrobe or cupboard typically found in a bedroom. It is used to store clothing such as shirts, pants, dresses, and suits. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as an armoire is not associated with these places.
The sentence implies that there are boxes in a location that cannot be accessed while standing upright, indicating that the boxes are likely stored in a space with a low ceiling or limited headroom. Basements and garages typically have higher ceilings and are more accessible, while bungalows and lofts may not have an attic space at all. Attics, on the other hand, are often known for having limited headroom and awkward angles, making it difficult to access certain areas while standing upright.
The question is asking about the emotional experience someone has after carrying out the task of housework. While it may be true that the result is a nice home and a clean house, the specific emotion being asked about is satisfaction. Boredom does not seem relevant to the task of housework, while tiredness may be a physical result but not necessarily an emotional one.
The sentence suggests that the local business purchased an advertisement on a form of public transportation. Options like "la ville" and "store" do not indicate a form of transportation. "Magazine" is not a form of transportation at all. While ads can certainly be placed on the sides of buses, the sentence specifically mentions a "local business," which suggests that they may have only purchased an ad on a more localized mode of transportation. Therefore, "taxi cab" is the most likely option.
The sentence indicates that the two teams were in constant competition, which suggests that they developed a sense of rivalry towards each other. Rivalry is a common result of competition, as each team tries to outperform the other. Accomplishment is not likely to have developed between the teams in this context, as they were competing against each other rather than working together towards a common goal. Enemies and bad blood also suggest a hostile relationship between the two teams, which is not necessarily the case here. Friendship is also unlikely to have developed between two competing teams.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is in the process of drinking a liquid and is at risk of spilling it over. The most logical action to take in this situation is to open your mouth so that the liquid can flow in without spilling. Closing your eyes or using a glass would not prevent spillage, and buying a bottle or eating first are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is using meditation and yoga to find something that would improve their mental and emotional state. Happiness is a commonly cited goal of meditation and yoga, as they are used to reduce stress and increase mindfulness. Ulcers, power, respect, and getting answers are not typically associated with the benefits of meditation and yoga.
The sentence implies that the losing project had very little effort put into it, making the opposite true for the winning project. "Significant" and "considerable" are synonyms that suggest a large amount of effort was put into the winning project. "Important" and "useful" do not convey the same idea of effort, and "unignorable" is not commonly used in this context.
The question asks about the behavior of fans towards players who are competing against each other. The word "competing" suggests a competitive environment, where fans may want to support their favorite players. The option "encouraging" aligns with this idea as fans often cheer for their favorite players and offer words of encouragement to lift their spirits. The other options (frustration, ignore, injury, emotions) do not fit the context and have a negative connotation.
Exercising is known to improve physical fitness, which includes an increase in cardiovascular endurance, strength, flexibility, and overall health. Being out of shape typically means that a person is not physically fit, and therefore exercising can lead to improved physical fitness. Exhaustion, breathlessness, and tiredness may occur initially, but these are temporary effects that typically dissipate with continued exercise, and are not the ultimate goal of exercising. Lost weight can be a result of exercise, but it is not a necessary or guaranteed outcome.
The question is asking about a common location for a calendar inside someone's home, which suggests it is likely to be a place where someone would see it frequently. This makes "desktop" a more likely option than "fridge" or "outside," which are typically not considered common locations for a calendar inside a home. "Wrist watch" and "office supply store" are also unlikely options as they do not relate to a specific location within the home.
The sentence suggests that the team is analyzing DNA evidence with the goal of discovering the truth about something. This implies that they are trying to solve a mystery or answer a question with the evidence they have gathered. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the process of analyzing DNA evidence or discovering the truth.
The sentence suggests that for some people, eating breakfast is an important part of their morning routine that they don't do until they have eaten. This implies that breakfast is important for these people and that they may not feel fully awake or alert until they have eaten. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate specifically to breakfast.
The sentence suggests that the car needed to be parked somewhere while the crew was working on the driveway. Among the choices given, the most reasonable option is to park it at a nearby location, and the neighbor's house would be a convenient option. The other options do not provide any logical place for the car to be parked.
The sentence suggests that chatting with friends and playing games is enjoyable. "Fun" is a common word used to describe activities that are enjoyable and entertaining. "Laughter" is also a positive experience but does not encompass the entirety of chatting and playing games. "Floating" and "discomfort" do not make sense in this context, and "inspiration" is not explicitly mentioned.
The sentence suggests that there is a publication that provides information about new bullet varieties for weapons enthusiasts. Magazines are a common source of information for enthusiasts of all kinds, including those interested in firearms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with information sources for weapons enthusiasts.
The sentence suggests that as a student matures, they are encouraged to develop independent thinking skills. This is a common expectation for students as they progress through their education and become more capable of critical thinking and problem-solving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Young children are not always able to control their bladder during sleep, which often leads to bedwetting. While snoring, sleepwalking, talking, and laughing are also behaviors commonly associated with sleep, they are not necessarily specific to young children. Therefore, the most likely answer based on the context of the question is "wetting bed."
The word "often" suggests that the answer may not be universally true, but is true in certain situations or contexts. The word "dirty" is sometimes used to describe sex that involves taboo or forbidden elements, or that may be considered socially unacceptable or immoral. The other options are more positive or neutral in connotation and do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John cares for Lucy, but has difficulty expressing it in a way that Lucy can understand. This implies that Lucy may not fully understand John's intentions or feelings towards her, which could lead to her feeling misunderstood. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they imply negative feelings and actions towards Lucy from John, which is not suggested in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the presence of different types of flowers would result in a visual display of varying colors. Flowers are often known for their bright and diverse colors, which is why this choice is the most appropriate. The other options do not directly relate to the visual aspect of flowers or are not necessarily true (e.g. not all flowers necessarily smell good or cover fields).
The context suggests that the individual had found something valuable or useful and wanted to bring it along, but was unable to due to lack of space. The word "acquire" means to obtain or gain possession of something, which would fit with the situation described. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.

The sentence suggests that there is a difference in behavior between two people and three people. Out of the options given, kissing is an activity that is commonly done by couples or pairs, whereas going hiking and grouping objects can be done by any number of people. Believing in God is also not necessarily limited to a certain number of individuals, and making babies typically requires more than two people.
The sentence suggests that the opening of the small beauty salon would have an impact on the local economy, which implies that it is located in a smaller, local area rather than in a larger city or strip mall. The phrase "locally owned" and "neighborhood" also imply a stronger connection to the immediate community. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence suggests that if you are caught hurting someone else, the authorities will take action against you. The most logical consequence of this behavior would be getting arrested. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that dogs experience itching, which is a common symptom of flea infestations. Fleas are small parasitic insects that can cause irritation and discomfort in dogs, and can be easily spread through contact with other infected animals or environments. The other options do not have any clear relationship to canine itching.
The sentence suggests that standing in line is a difficult experience and there is likely to be some form of physical discomfort associated with it. The choice "tiredness" is the most fitting, as standing in line can cause fatigue or weariness over time, making it more difficult to maintain one's position in line. The other choices (fidgeting, pain, and cars) either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not relate to the physical discomfort associated with standing in line.
The question suggests that there is an important aspect of living that people often neglect. Out of the given choices, only 'trying to stay happy' fits the context of the question. Falling in love and doing sports are undoubtedly important aspects of life, but they are not necessarily overlooked or forgotten. Similarly, dying is simply a natural part of the life cycle, while 'seeing' could refer to a variety of things and does not necessarily relate to the question.
Learning to play the violin typically requires formal instruction, which is why "take lessons" is the correct answer. Tuning the violin, practicing regularly, and asking questions can all be helpful in the learning process, but without professional guidance, it is unlikely that someone can become proficient in playing the violin. Relaxing may be beneficial for reducing stress or anxiety before or after practice, but it is not directly related to learning to play the violin.
The sentence suggests that playing poker involves an element of luck, but being successful in the game requires something else. The word "consistent" implies that the person must be able to repeat their successes and avoid failures, which is likely to be the result of a skill rather than a random event. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that Sally isn't beautiful and describes her appearance as just plain. However, it is also mentioned that she has image issues and thinks that she is something negative. Out of the given choices, ugly is the most extreme and negative option, which fits with Sally's self-perception issues. The other choices do not necessarily describe Sally's self-perception accurately and are not supported by the given sentence.
The question mentions that the purpose of drinking was to get drunk, which implies that the individual consumed a significant amount of alcohol. Hangovers are commonly experienced after consuming large amounts of alcohol and are characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, and dehydration. The other options, such as getting drunk or loss of control, describe the act of drinking rather than the aftermath, while need to urinate and sickness can occur with or without alcohol consumption.
The sentence implies that the favorite show has a specific purpose or effect, which is to eliminate a particular feeling. The options "happiness" and "entertained" describe positive feelings that the show may create, but they are not the feeling being eliminated. "Entertains" is a verb and does not describe the feeling being eliminated. "Buy tickets" is not a feeling at all, but rather a possible action related to attending a show. Therefore, the correct answer is "boredom", as it is the only option that describes a feeling that the show aims to eliminate.
The question implies that there is some danger facing trees and that one location is safest for them. The rainforest is a natural habitat for many species of trees and provides ample resources for them to thrive, making it a likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question and do not offer any convincing reason for why they might be safer than other areas.
The sentence suggests that the people went shopping specifically to buy racks, which are typically used for construction or storage purposes. The verb "build" is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to the purpose of buying racks. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical connection to the idea of buying racks.
The phrase "weasel out" suggests that the person is trying to avoid the consequences of their actions, which may be a reference to the animal known for its slick and elusive behavior. Since weasels often hide in small and cramped spaces, the chicken coop might be a fitting metaphorical location for someone trying to escape from punishment. The other options, such as court room or jail, are more straightforward and do not carry the same connotations as "weasel out."
The sentence implies that having plenty to eat during lunch will result in a feeling of being satiated or full. "Getting in line" and "pouring coffee" are irrelevant to the context and don't make logical sense as answers, while "feel empty" is the opposite of what would happen if one had plenty to eat.
The sentence implies that people enjoy eating hamburgers, which suggests that taste is a primary factor. Clogged arteries, indigestion, and weight gain are all negative consequences associated with consuming too much fast food, which suggests they are not typically reasons why people like eating hamburgers. "Having fun" is also a possible reason, as hamburgers are a common food choice for social gatherings and backyard BBQs, but it is not mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the action of trying to help someone has had a negative effect, which is commonly referred to as "hindering" their progress or situation. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. Succeed and anticipate both suggest a positive outcome, while do nothing suggests no effect at all. Hurting may also suggest a negative outcome, but it does not match the context of trying to help someone.
The sentence implies that there is a specific type of venue or event where older people are more likely to appreciate the singer's performance than the actual music being played. Opera is a type of musical performance that places a strong emphasis on the vocal performance of the lead singers, and many older people may appreciate the skill and technique required to perform in this style. The other options do not have a strong association with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the act of stopping being married to someone allowed the person to pursue their dreams, which implies that the marriage was somehow holding them back or causing them stress. Therefore, the most likely answer would be relief as it would bring a sense of comfort and release from the emotional burden of the marriage. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Fishing requires specific equipment such as a fishing rod, which is used to cast the line, and tackle, which includes hooks, weights, and other accessories to catch fish. Bate is also essential as it is used to attract fish to the hook. A boat or fishing pole may be optional and dependent on the type of fishing and location.
The sentence suggests that Alexa is looking for a safe and secure place to store her acoustic guitar when she is not playing it. Among the choices provided, a closet would be the best option as it provides privacy and security, and the guitar can be safely stored away from any potential hazards that could damage it. The other options, such as a drawer, music shop, house, or studio, may not offer the same level of security or privacy for Alexa's guitar.
The question is asking for a physical action associated with love. Kissing is a well-known expression of love and affection, frequently used in romantic relationships, familial relationships, and even friendships. The other options, such as killing or painting, are not typically associated with expressions of love. Forgiving or pleasing parents may be actions taken out of love, but they are not physical expressions like kissing.
Watching television is often associated with entertainment, as people tune in to see their favorite shows or programs that are designed to provide amusement or diversion from daily life. While it is true that some people may watch television to be quiet or get comfortable, these reasons do not fully capture the main purpose of watching television, which is to be entertained. Additionally, the option "you're bored" may be a reason someone watches television, but it is not a goal or outcome that someone hopes to achieve.
The sentence mentions a costumed person, which is a common sight at Disneyland where employees often dress up as Disney characters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies a specific situation in which girls would eat ice cream on the couch. The most logical reason for this would be if they were hungry and wanted a snack. The other options don't seem to be related to the context of the sentence or provide a reason for eating ice cream on the couch.
The act of praying is often associated with seeking comfort and guidance from a higher power. Therefore, it is likely that someone who is praying while waiting for an outcome may feel comforted by the belief that they are not alone and that their prayer may be answered. The other options may be possible outcomes of praying in different contexts, but they do not necessarily apply to the specific question being asked.
Going on vacation can be enjoyable and relaxing, but it also comes with potential risks. One common risk is overspending, as vacations often involve expenses for transportation, accommodations, food, and activities. This can lead to financial stress or debt if not planned and managed carefully. The other options in the choices are not risks, but rather outcomes or feelings associated with going on vacation.
Shoes are commonly stored in closets or under beds as these are common storage spaces for footwear. Although shoes could technically be found under any of the options listed, such as a rug or table, these are not typical or expected storage locations for shoes. A water buffalo is not a logical choice for this question since it is not associated with shoe storage in any way.
The sentence indicates that the man wanted to have food ready for the work week, which suggests that he would need to prepare his meals in advance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: chewing and eating both refer to the act of consuming food, while digesting is a natural bodily process that occurs after eating.
Eggs are typically freshest when they are collected directly from the source, which would be a chicken coop in this case. Supermarkets and grocery stores may sell fresh eggs that are still relatively close to their collection date, but they may not be as fresh as eggs from a chicken coop. Eggs would not typically be found in a salad as a whole, and certainly not fresh ones. Similarly, eggs would not be found in a bird's nest as they would likely already be hatched and gone.
Cabinets are a common storage solution for bowls in homes and kitchens. They provide a secure and protected space for the bowl, while keeping it easily accessible for future use. The other options are not viable storage locations for a bowl - apartments are not specific enough, outside leaves the bowl exposed to the elements, the dishwasher is not a storage solution, and a restaurant would not be a personal storage location.
Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar, which is located off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is known for its unique and diverse array of animal species, including lemurs, which are arboreal primates that live in forested areas. The other options (hole, australia, cage, wilderness) do not have any connection to the geographical location of lemurs.
The sentence suggests that the child was experimenting with electricity, which can be dangerous if not handled properly. The word "feel" implies that the child experienced a physical sensation as a result of their experiment. "Shock" is the most common physical sensation associated with electricity and is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential dangers of experimenting with electricity.
The sentence suggests that the person found the email funny, but did not reply to it. The word "although" also implies that the person did something else with the email. Of the choices provided, "forward" is the most likely option, as the person may have wanted to share the funny email with someone else. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve any action being taken with the email.
In the context of the sentence, it's reasonable to assume that the folding chairs are larger items that require some space. Churches, attics, rooms, and closets are typically not large enough to store multiple folding chairs. On the other hand, garages are often used for storage of larger items like cars, bicycles, and outdoor equipment, making it the most likely option for storing folding chairs after a party.
The context of the sentence suggests that the policemen are wearing safety vests and holding flashlights, which are common tools used for directing traffic. This would be especially likely if the policemen were standing at an intersection or near a construction site, where traffic needs to be redirected for safety reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
An armchair that is used by many people is likely to be found in a lounge or a common area where people gather and relax. Offices and studies are typically private spaces, and armchairs used in hospitals are likely to be specialized for medical purposes. Furniture stores may have armchairs on display, but they are not typically used by many people until they are purchased and taken home.
The question is asking about a psychological benefit of having fun, which implies that the answer should be related to mental or emotional well-being. Out of the options provided, stress relief is the most directly linked to this theme. Studies show that having fun and engaging in enjoyable activities can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood. The other options (glee, smiling, twinkle, may laugh) are related to happiness or expression of emotions, but they do not specifically address the psychological benefits of having fun.
The sentence describes a scene where wild flowers are in bloom, which suggests that the entire area is covered in flowers. The options "table," "vase," and "nursery" do not fit the context, while "countryside" could be a possible answer, but the phrase "entire countryside" does not quite fit the sentence. Therefore, it is most likely that the sentence is referring to the surface of the earth as a whole.
A loft is a type of living space that is often found in frame houses, which are typically constructed with wooden frames as opposed to concrete or other materials. It is less likely that guns would be stored in a kitchen or city apartment, as these locations may not have the necessary security measures or legal permission for storing firearms. A hunting lodge or ranch may also be viable options, but the context of the sentence does not provide any clear indication that the location is specifically a hunting or rural setting.
The sentence indicates that the school has three wings and enough space for 5000 students, which implies that it is a large building capable of accommodating a significant number of people. The other choices, such as buffalo, hospital, birdhouse, and mansion, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to describe a school in this manner.
The sentence suggests that the setting is one where a musical performance is being held, as there are people singing and a bass clarinet playing. Out of the choices provided, an opera house is the most likely setting for a performance involving singing and orchestral instruments like the bass clarinet. The other options, such as a school band or a music store, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence implies that the farmer is growing a specific type of plant, which is a tomato. Therefore, it can be inferred that the farmer specializes in cultivating plants. The other choices, such as flowering or barn, do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence. The word "growth" could be a potential answer, but it is not specific enough as it does not mention what is growing.
The sentence suggests that James was planning a vacation as a way to fulfill a need he had. The context implies that this need was related to his work and a desire to take a break or unwind. The option "relaxation" fits this context, whereas the other options do not directly relate to the need or reason mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the product has a reputation for not lasting, implying that it may break down or stop working over time. "Wear out" is a common phrase used to describe objects that become worn down and less functional with use. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning conveyed by the sentence, as they suggest more dramatic and sudden forms of destruction.
The sentence suggests that the alley cats were all gathering together, but then something caused them to suddenly move or scatter in different directions. The word "scatter" is a synonym of "disperse" or "spread out," which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sudden and chaotic movement described in the sentence.
The sentence implies that Sarah was doing something productive or work-related while on vacation, and her mother was not pleased with her actions. "Unemployment," "say something," and "relaxation" all do not fit the context of the sentence, while "do nothing" could be a possibility, but does not match the mention of "hard work." "Earn money" is the best choice as it aligns with the idea that Sarah was doing something productive and work-related while on vacation.
The question is asking for something that is produced by the voice, and the word "sound" is a direct result of vibrations in the vocal cords. Volume and loudness both refer to the level of sound produced, while being heard is more of a passive action that results from the sound being produced. "Beautiful" is subjective and not necessarily related to the production of sound itself.
The act of getting wet is often associated with trying to achieve a cooling effect. When we get wet, whether through swimming or taking a shower, the water helps to lower our body temperature by conducting heat away from our skin. The option "get cold" may seem like a viable choice given the context, but it implies a passive state rather than an active pursuit. "Shrinking" is not a practical goal for most people when getting wet, and "shower" is a specific way of getting wet rather than a general purpose.
The question suggests that something may fall or end up on the roof, which can be caused by external factors such as a nearby tree. Tree limbs or branches can be dislodged during storms or heavy winds and can fall on a roof causing damage or debris. The other options do not have a clear association with the idea of something falling onto the roof.
Learning about world poverty can lead to a deeper understanding of the causes and effects of poverty, and can motivate individuals and organizations to search for possible solutions to alleviate it. While it may also cause feelings of sadness or confusion, the ultimate goal is to find ways to address the issue and create positive change. Enlightenment may also be a result of learning about world poverty, as it can broaden one's perspective and understanding of global issues. Loss of innocence, however, does not seem to be a likely outcome of learning about world poverty.
The word "herd" refers to a group of grazing animals, typically cows or other livestock. The options "slaughterhouse" and "dairy farm" suggest that the heifer will be used for meat or milk production, which is not mentioned in the question. "Cow palace" is not a typical term used to describe a place where cows graze or live. "Barnyard" could be a possibility, but it is a more general term that could refer to any area where livestock are kept, while "cow pasture" specifically refers to an open grazing area for cows.
The context of the sentence suggests that what the audience is watching is a form of entertainment. Out of the given choices, only a movie theater is typically associated with showing movies that contain scenes of battles, shooting, and explosions. The other options, such as a church or a hockey game, do not typically involve this type of content. While stadiums may host events that feature battles or explosions, the mention of "New York Stadium" in particular is unlikely to be relevant to the sentence.
Onions are best stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place to keep them fresh and prevent them from sprouting. The pantry and front porch are usually not cool enough to store them, and leaving them on the table may expose them to heat and moisture, causing them to go bad quickly. Pizza has no relevance to this question, making the correct answer "refrigerator."
The question implies that the mandolin needs to be stored somewhere when not in use. Among the options provided, closet is unlikely to be the correct answer since it does not provide proper protection for the instrument. Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store are not suitable answers as they are places where instruments are sold, not stored. The most logical answer is instrument case, as it is designed specifically for the purpose of storing and protecting musical instruments.

The sentence implies that the audience is likely watching a sports game or activity where a ball is being used. This type of event usually takes place in a stadium, where there is a large open space for players to move around and spectators to watch from various angles. The other options do not typically have events that involve a ball being thrown or hit.
The sentence implies that when children are happy, they engage in some kind of physical activity that indicates their joy, as opposed to passive activities like watching TV or sleeping. Skipping is a form of physical expression that is often associated with happiness and carefree behavior in children, hence it is the most appropriate option among the given choices. 'Enjoyed' is a past participle and cannot be used to describe actions in the present tense. 'Sleep' and 'watch television' are not indicative of children's happiness in this context, and 'awesome' is an adjective that does not describe an action.
Public phones are typically found in places where people may need to make calls but do not have access to a personal phone, such as rest areas along highways. The other options do not typically have public phones available, and it would be unusual to find a public phone in an office or someone's house.
The word "perfunctory" suggests that the person completed something in a hasty, routine manner that lacks attention to detail. Therefore, the natural desire after completing something perfunctorily would be to move on quickly to the next task or activity, rather than to stay and examine or redo the work. The other options, such as "careful," "thoughtful," and "thorough," imply a level of attention and detail that is incongruent with the context of the sentence.
A "quarter" typically refers to 25% of something, and in this sentence, it is specified that the quarter in question has a weight of 25 pounds. This suggests that the item being weighed is likely measured in pounds or something similar, which rules out choices like "school year," "upper," and "century." "Hour" is also not a likely answer, as it is a unit of time rather than weight. "Hundredweight," on the other hand, is a unit of weight that equals 100 pounds, and therefore fits with the information provided in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John did not have to ride his bike, but he still did it for a reason. The reason is likely to be something that is enjoyable or pleasurable to him, since he was not doing it out of necessity such as thirst or fatigue. The options "for fun" and "pleasure" are synonymous with enjoyment and fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the play was about to start, which is a clear indication that the setting is a theatrical performance. The choice "theatre" refers to a venue specifically designed for stage performances, which would be the most likely location for the play to take place. The other options, such as "show" or "in cinema," are too vague to accurately describe the setting implied by the sentence. "Bench" and "Martorell" are unlikely options as they don't directly relate to the context of the sentence.
In the context of theater or acting, a cast typically refers to the group of actors who perform on stage. The word "perform" is also commonly associated with acting and theater, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is "stage." The other options, such as "cast net" and "broken leg," are unrelated to acting or theater. "Film" might also be a valid answer, but it is less specific than "stage" and could refer to acting in movies or television shows as well.
The sentence suggests that dancing poorly in public can lead to a negative emotional experience. The word "humiliation" specifically denotes a feeling of shame or embarrassment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options don't necessarily convey a negative emotional experience related to dancing poorly, such as exhaustion or fatigue (which are physical sensations) and blisters or recognizance (which don't necessarily indicate a negative emotional experience).
The sentence describes an object with a point that is used for mountain climbing. This eliminates choices such as hat, arrowhead, and needle, which are not associated with mountain climbing equipment. Waterpoint is also unlikely, as it does not have a point and is not used for climbing. Alpenstock, on the other hand, is a type of pole or stick used specifically for mountain climbing and is known for its pointed tip.
Apiarists are beekeepers, and the term "queen" refers to the female bee responsible for laying eggs and leading the hive. To introduce a new queen to a hive, the apiarist typically cages her or binds her wings to prevent her from leaving. The logical answer to the question, therefore, is "beehive." The other options, such as "England," "monarchy," or "deck of cards," have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets that are similar to Earth. This is a statistical estimate that is difficult to confirm, but it suggests that the number of planets like Earth is very large. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. "God's creation" is a religious concept and not a scientific explanation for the existence of planets. "Ball stopped" and "gravity" are physical concepts that do not relate to the number of planets in the universe. The Milky Way is a galaxy, but the sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets like Earth in the entire universe, not just one galaxy.
The context of the sentence suggests that John is attempting to start a fire, which is commonly done by using a match or other ignition source. The other options do not fit the context as there is no indication that John is frustrated, trying to illuminate anything, or trying to intentionally set something on fire.
The behavior described in the sentence is typical of a monkey who is feeling playful and energetic. Monkeys are known for climbing, jumping, and swinging, especially within their habitat. The other options do not provide any clues as to the monkey's behavior or emotions. Brazil and the rain forest are locations that monkeys are found, but they do not necessarily tell us about the specific behavior of the monkey in the sentence. Treetops and busy are also not directly related to the monkey's behavior or emotions.
Going to play is typically seen as a fun and enjoyable activity for children, which would lead to a positive emotional response such as happiness. Tears and sitting would suggest negative or indifferent emotions, while being entertained and laughter are more general emotions that can apply to a variety of situations and do not necessarily indicate a specific reaction to going to play.
The sentence suggests that LEDs (light emitting diodes) are commonly found on keyboards and other items, indicating that they are typically used in electronic devices. The other options - television, pc board, electrical machine, and dashboard - are not typically associated with the use of LEDs.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is expressing a desire for physical intimacy with a pretty girl before going to bed. The phrase "get warm" may be a euphemism for engaging in sexual activity, which would make "get laid" the correct answer. The other options do not fit with the implied meaning of the sentence.
Supermarkets are known for selling a wide variety of items, including food and beverages. Alcohol is often sold in supermarkets, along with other items for nourishment such as snacks, fruits, and vegetables. The other options do not typically sell both alcohol and items for nourishment. The lunch room may sell food, but typically not alcohol. The chemistry lab is not a place to buy food or alcohol, and restaurants and pubs may sell alcohol but may not have a wide selection of nourishing items for purchase.
Flats are typically found in larger structures like apartment buildings, whereas options like London, City, and Town are too broad and do not appropriately capture the context of the question. Condominiums can also refer to individual units like flats, but they are not always grouped together in a larger building as frequently as flats are.
The sentence suggests that the person only enjoys reading fiction books, but there may be a benefit to reading a non-fiction book. The answer "knowledge" is the most logical choice, as non-fiction books are often written to teach readers about a particular subject or provide information about real events. By reading a non-fiction book, the person could expand their knowledge and learn something new. The other options (been printed new, many words, for fun, cover) do not provide a compelling reason to read a non-fiction book.
Cows are typically raised on farms or ranches for their milk, meat, or as draft animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be "ranch." The other options, such as "road" and "slaughterhouse," do not make sense in the context of where a cow would be present, while "Switzerland" and "Tennessee" do not provide any information about where cows are located.
A real estate agent's primary job is to help their customers find a suitable property within their budget. Offering a price is a common action that a real estate agent could take in order to negotiate a deal with the seller of a house. Misrepresenting, covering up, deceiving, or leaving town are all unethical or illegal actions that a real estate agent should not engage in. These options do not align with the responsibilities of a real estate agent.
The sentence implies that the person did not like the previous mattress because it was too rigid or hard, so they are likely seeking a mattress that is softer and more comfortable. Out of the choices given, ductility, malleability, and flexibility all refer to a object's ability to bend or change shape, which is not directly related to comfort. Empity is not a word, and therefore cannot be the answer.
The question refers to creating a new version of an existing movie, which is commonly known as a remake. The term reproduction refers to creating a copy of an original artwork or document, and may not fit the context of the question. Junior is not commonly used in this context. Copy and derivative could apply to many types of media, not only movies, and may not provide enough specificity to answer the question accurately.
The sentence implies that excessive shopping can have negative consequences. Overdraft and bankruptcy are both financial issues that can arise from spending more money than one has, which can be a result of excessive shopping. Calluses and tiredness are physical effects and are not directly related to shopping. Although spending money is a consequence of shopping, it is not necessarily negative on its own.
The sentence suggests that an over-heated snake will seek shelter in a house, and the correct answer is likely a location in a house that is cooler than other areas. Basements are typically cooler than other parts of a house, which would make it a likely hiding place for an over-heated snake. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A saxophone is a musical instrument and would likely only be found in a place that sells musical instruments, such as a music store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for the easiest place to live, which suggests a place that provides ideal conditions for survival. A temperate climate is typically characterized by moderate temperatures, with neither extreme heat nor extreme cold, which can be ideal for humans and many other animals to live in. The other options do not provide clear benefits for survival, and in some cases (such as gravesites), are not suitable for living at all.
The sentence suggests that a hard substance can take on different forms, which implies that it is something that can be manipulated or molded in different ways. The option "formed into cubes" best fits this description, as it suggests a solid substance that can be shaped into different forms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Ice cream" is not a hard substance and "chipped" and "found in Arctic" do not necessarily imply different forms.
Pleasure gardens were typically designed as an extension of the palace or royal residence, so it is likely that nymphs would be associated with this location. Nymphs are also commonly associated with nature and beauty, which aligns with the ornate and carefully curated aesthetic of a pleasure garden. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that there is a subway station that goes by a different name than what is traditionally used for subway stations in other locations. India is the correct answer because their subway stations are called "metro" stations. London and New York use the term "subway" and "underground," respectively, to refer to their stations. "Big city" and "Manhattan" are too general and do not give any specific information about the name of a subway station.
The question asks for a location to put a rosebush if the person does not want to keep it outside, implying that the rosebush needs to be kept indoors. Therefore, the correct answer would be a pot or container, which allows the individual to keep the rosebush indoors and move it around if needed. The other options suggest outdoor locations and are not appropriate for an indoor plant.
The sentence suggests that the problem with the door occurs when it is closed, which points to an issue with the door's frame or jamb. A jamb is the vertical surface that forms the sides of a doorway or window frame. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone jogging has a long-term goal in mind, which is likely related to their health. Jogging is a popular form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, increase overall fitness, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. The other options are potential negative outcomes of jogging and would not be goals someone would want to achieve.
The sentence suggests that the object being referred to has an accelerator and is owned by most people. Airplanes are not commonly owned by most people, but rather by airlines or aviation companies. Fuel systems and accelerate are not objects that can be owned, but rather parts or actions associated with a vehicle. Therefore, the correct answer would be "car," which is a vehicle commonly owned by individuals and has an accelerator.
The sentence suggests that the person sustained a significant injury that requires medical attention. While a doctor's office or an emergency room could also be options for medical care, the mention of a "bad" injury implies that the person may need more extensive treatment than a doctor's office could provide. The other options, such as a hockey game or home, do not make sense in the context of someone needing medical attention for an injury.
The sentence suggests that the person has a new puppy that needs to go to the bathroom, and they have a newspaper to catch the leaks. The most logical place to put the newspaper would be outside, where the puppy can easily access it and where it won't make a mess inside. The porch is a suitable location for this purpose. The other options, such as floor, jail, next door, or library, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is going to work in the morning and returning to work in the evening, which implies that they are leaving work at the end of the day. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in the given situation.
The sentence suggests that the gentleman needs to use the restroom while out for dinner, which is commonly referred to as the "men's room". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Baseball stadiums are typically located in urban areas because they require a large amount of space and accessibility for fans. Urban areas provide the necessary infrastructure, transportation, and population density to support a major league baseball stadium. The other options, such as other countries or specific cities, do not make as much sense as they do not have a universal connection to where baseball stadiums are commonly located.
The sentence suggests that not sleeping well leads to a certain feeling or state. Being tired is a common symptom of not getting enough sleep, which is why it is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately describe the feeling or state associated with sleep deprivation. "Time to sleep" is a suggestion, "closing eyes" is a physical action, "falling down" suggests a loss of balance or consciousness and "darkness" refers to the absence of light.
The question asks for the best place to store important documents such as a car title or home deed. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, such as important documents, jewelry, and other items that are difficult or impossible to replace if lost or stolen. A glove box or library book would not provide adequate security, and a magazine article is not a suitable place for storing important documents.
The sentence suggests that when two people who love each other are alone, they will want to be in each other's company and not be with other people or in a crowded setting. The word "contact" in this context means to connect or communicate with each other. Therefore, the most logical answer is "together." The other options do not make sense in the given sentence.
A paper clip is a small office supply commonly used to attach or hold together sheets of paper. It is often kept in a desk drawer because it is a frequently used item in an office setting. The other options (file cabinet, file folder, hospital, cabinet) do not typically house paper clips.
The word "maid" typically refers to someone who is hired to clean and maintain a house, so the end result of hiring a maid is likely to have a clean house. The other options are less likely outcomes, with "an affair" being completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the businessman carried the book with him to work, as he kept it "beneath all his work." The most likely place for him to store a book that he carries with him to work would be in his briefcase. The other options, such as a shoe box, backpack, or synagogue, do not seem highly practical or appropriate for storing a book that is meaningful to a businessman.
The sentence suggests that the subject has experienced a loss and is looking for something to help them feel better. "Win" is the most likely answer as it is the opposite of "loss" and could bring a sense of victory or accomplishment. "Contemplate" and "gain" may be too abstract or unrelated to the context. "Money" and "profit" may have a positive connotation, but they do not necessarily suggest a solution to the problem at hand.
The most likely place for the truck driver to find a Bible would be in a church. Bibles are considered to be a holy text by many religious groups, and churches often have a supply of them on hand for visitors and worshippers to use. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - confession is a religious rite, not a place to find a Bible, and hotels/motels are unlikely to have Bibles available for reading.
A projectile is an object that is launched into the air and travels through it until it hits a target. In this question, the options "battlefield," "gun," and "weapon" suggest a context of warfare where projectiles might be used, but none of them correctly answer the question as they do not describe what the projectile passes through. "Baseball" is also unrelated to the question. The correct answer is "air" because it is the medium through which a projectile travels.
The question is asking what beginning work is likely to lead to, which implies that the answer should be related to work or the workday. While options like sleeping and excitement may be things we experience before or after work, they do not directly answer the question of what beginning work is likely to lead to. The option "momentum" could be a possibility, but it is not clear how it relates to the specific context of beginning work. Therefore, the most logical answer is "working," as beginning work is likely to lead to a day of work. The option "stress" could also be a possibility, but it would depend on the context and personal experience of the individual.
The sentence suggests that a person is waiting for food, which is commonly associated with being in a restaurant. The other options (church basement, wedding party) do not have any clear connection to waiting for food. The misspelling of "restaurant" as "restorand" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The option "feel relaxed" may be a desirable outcome of being in a restaurant, but it is not an action that a person would physically do in the reception area.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is in a professional setting, which typically requires a certain level of formality in dress. The most formal option listed is a suit, which is commonly worn by men in professional or business settings. The other options, such as tshirt or club attire, are not appropriate for a professional setting. Europe and church do not provide enough information to suggest a specific type of attire.
The phrase "thoroughly enjoys himself" suggests that the person may become addicted to using the computer. This is a common problem with technology and can have negative effects on a person's health and well-being. The other options do not necessarily follow from the sentence or are not related to computer use (e.g. sitting).
The sentence suggests that Jennifer's behavior had negative consequences on her connections with others. The words "abrasive" and "clingy" imply that she was difficult to be around, which could lead people to pull away and, eventually, sever the connection entirely. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jane caught someone flirting with her boyfriend, which can be a potentially upsetting situation. The most appropriate emotional response would be anger, as Jane may feel betrayed or disrespected by the other person's behavior. Jealousy is also a possible response, but it may not be the best answer as the sentence doesn't explicitly mention feeling envious or insecure. Unwanted pregnancy and happiness are unrelated and unlikely responses to the situation, while getting into trouble doesn't make sense as it is unclear who would be getting into trouble or why.
Lizards are known to be cold-blooded animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. They will often bask in the sun on rocks or other warm surfaces to raise their body temperature. Therefore, rocky places would be the most suitable location for lizards to sun themselves. The other options are not natural habitats for lizards, and a tanning bed is not conducive to the needs of these animals.
Crab is a commonly consumed seafood, and people often make various dishes and meals using crab meat. The other options are not directly related to the context of the question and do not provide information about what people typically make with crab. The Chinese market may sell crab as a food item, but it is not a specific answer to the question. The fish market may sell a variety of seafood, including crab, but it does not indicate what people make with crab. The aquarium and tidal flats are not related to the use of crab for food.
The sentence suggests that the student was attempting to find a synonym for "standard" that would impress the reader. The fact that the word he found had a slant rhyme with "proverbial" indicates that it might have been an unusual or poetic word. Of the options provided, "nonstandard" is the most likely to fit these criteria. "Informal," "basic," and "colloquial" are more common and less likely to impress a reader, while "stanine" is not a word commonly used in everyday language.
The sentence suggests that John traveled to a place where the light faded away until it was pitch black, which is often associated with enclosed spaces that do not have windows or openings to let natural light in. Attics are typically located at the topmost part of a building and often have limited natural light sources. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence contrasted Sean's honesty with June's lack of honesty, indicating that she is not simply untruthful or a liar, but rather deceitful. Deceitfulness implies a deliberate intention to deceive or mislead others, which goes beyond simply being untruthful or unreliable. The other options may be synonyms of deceitful in some contexts, but do not capture the same level of intentional deception.
The sentence suggests that the task is to catch a mouse. The most common and effective way to do this is by using a trap specifically designed for catching mice. The other options, such as disneyland, cupboard, and sewer, have no relevance to the task of catching a mouse, and a large bottle of valium is not a humane or ethical method of catching any animal.
The question implies that a choker is a type of jewelry that is not typically found in a jewelry store or boutique. Instead, the answer is likely to be found in a jewelry box, which is a storage container for jewelry. The other options (suffocation, boutique, and kennel) have no obvious connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that washing hands after certain activities is beneficial and can keep you in good health. Regular hand-washing is a key practice in preventing the spread of diseases and infections. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the woman had a spare key with her, and the most logical place to keep a spare key while out and about would be in her purse. The other options do not make as much sense as a place to keep a spare key, as they are either unrelated or not practical for carrying a spare key.
The context of the question suggests that the door being referred to is used to store cars. Out of the choices provided, only a garage is commonly used to store cars, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as a house, file cabinet, or safe, are not typically used to store cars and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The use of the word "bulky" suggests that the man is likely interested in building or maintaining muscle mass, which requires consuming adequate amounts of protein. Hamburger is a relatively high protein food, so this aligns with the sentence. "Crack" and "cook one" are not related to the context of the sentence and "good to eat" and "satisfy hunger" are too general and do not provide a clear answer.
The sentence suggests that the steel cable has not been completed yet, which means it is in the process of being manufactured. A factory is the most likely place to find a steel cable that has not been completed yet because it is where steel cables are typically produced. The other options – winch, roller coaster, ship, and building – are not logical places to find an incomplete steel cable, as they are not typically associated with the production of steel cables.
The context of cowboys herding heifers implies that they are likely on a ranch or farm rather than near a deep sea, slaughterhouse, or barnyard. The most likely choice is a cattle ranch where cowboy work and manage cattle.
Weasels are known to be skilled hunters and often prey on small animals such as chickens. Therefore, if a weasel is hungry, it is likely to go to a place where it can find easy access to prey, such as a chicken coop. The other options, such as a court room, natural history museum, or cherry tree, do not provide suitable habitats for a weasel to find food. Backyards could potentially have food sources such as bird feeders or garbage cans, but a chicken coop is a more likely target for a hungry weasel.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking to obtain butter to use for baking. While it is possible they may have stored some butter in their refrigerator, this is not a guarantee. Similarly, using butter from a neighbor or pastry shop may not be an option. However, a store is a likely place to find butter for purchase.
Celebrating is usually associated with positive events (e.g. birthdays, graduations, weddings), which would result in the person feeling happy or excited. Becoming tired or experiencing hangovers are typically not associated with celebrations, and drinking is a behavior that may or may not be present during a celebration.
The sentence suggests that the person being referred to has moved to a different state, which implies a significant physical distance from the speaker. "Far" is the most appropriate word to describe this type of distance. "There" refers to the location where the person has moved and does not inherently imply a specific distance. "Nearby" implies close proximity, which contradicts the idea of the person being far away. "In sight" and "being here" imply that the person is still nearby and visible, which again contradicts the idea of them being far away.
The sentence suggests that the man was looking for a snack, which is typically stored in a fridge. The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not commonly used to store food items. A hardware store sells tools and equipment, a frying pan is used for cooking, a water fountain dispenses water, and a drawer is used to store non-refrigerated items.
The sentence suggests that tying an event when competing is not an option, which means that the only possible outcomes are winning or losing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is standing in line for the box office to see a live performance, which is commonly associated with theatres. A theatre is a venue specifically designed to showcase live performances such as plays, musicals, and concerts. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, such as a venue or theater district which could refer to various types of events. A movie theater and ballpark are also not associated with live stage performances.
The sentence suggests that the lady is preparing for a formal evening event, and specifically mentions specialized looking glasses and gown, which are typically associated with formal events like those held at the opera. The fact that the butler is sent to a ticket office further supports this inference, as ticket offices for events like the opera are usually located at the venue itself, such as an opera house, rather than a train station or arena. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The term "outdoors man" suggests that the person is likely seeking outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or fishing. The option "camp ground" specifically refers to a place where people can set up tents or park RVs for overnight stays while engaging in outdoor activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with outdoor activities.
The sentence suggests that a song has the ability to emotionally affect the listener, and this effect is achieved through one of the five senses. The phrase "touch your heart" implies that the effect is emotional, rather than physical. The options "smelling" and "sniff" are related to the sense of smell, which is not commonly associated with music. "Seeing" and "sight" refer to the sense of sight, which is not directly related to the experience of listening to music. Therefore, "hearing" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the sense directly related to the experience of listening to music.
The sentence suggests that James was sitting quietly and not doing something easily because the speaker was having trouble with something. The options discomfort, anxiety, and solitude may suggest that James was either feeling uncomfortable, worried, or alone. However, the option of falling asleep does not fit with the context of the sentence as it suggests that James was feeling tired and sleepy, which is not relevant to the situation described. The option of playing games also does not fit with the context as it is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is he was not falling asleep easily.
The word "dominance" suggests that the birds may be engaging in aggressive behavior. "Peck" is the only choice that describes a behavior that could be considered aggressive. "Sky", "mate", "hatch", and "forest" do not relate to the concept of aggressive behavior or dominance.
The sentence suggests that the place being described is one that contains dead bodies, which is typical of a mortuary. The use of the word "morbid" reinforces this idea, as mortuaries deal with death and are often associated with negativity. The phrase "something very human" suggests that there is an emotional component to the place, which could be related to the grieving process or the solemnity of the situation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking specifically about the location of the principal's office, which is typically found in a school building. The other options such as hallway, work, city, or skyscraper do not necessarily have a direct association with the location of a principal's office.
The sentence suggests that the real estate person had a negative impact on people, and that in order to improve, she needs to learn a new skill. The options of deceive, manipulate, and lie, all suggest unethical behavior, which would not be a desirable trait in someone in real estate. The option of train is too vague, and doesn't provide any information on what specific skill she would need to learn. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be charming, as this suggests that she needs to improve her interpersonal skills in order to better relate to clients and improve her sales tactics.
The sentence suggests that expressing oneself can lead to being understood, implying that the speaker may have previously not been understood. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the question is asking about the first person in a group to have a child, which would mean the answer is related to the act of giving birth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. While some of the options, such as love, anxiety, and making new friends may be relevant to the experience of having a child, they are not specific to the first person in a group to do so.
The sentence suggests that the scorecards of the best contestant were lower due to jealousy, and that an investigation was conducted to determine whether the judge's scoring was fair. This implies that the judge may have been biased or unfair in their scoring, hence prompting an investigation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Emilio needed to exercise, but he did not do it. The term "lazy" is commonly associated with people who do not do physical activity even though they know it is beneficial. The other options, such as "suffered from bad breath" or "work out," are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide a likely explanation for why Emilio did not exercise.
The word "static" typically refers to interference or noise in the communication channel that can disrupt or distort the transmission of information. This interference can cause communication to break down or become difficult, which would explain why it could stop two people from communicating effectively. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
An honor killing is a type of murder carried out by a family member against another family member who is perceived to have brought shame or dishonor to the family. The purpose of an honor killing is often to restore the family's honor or reputation, which suggests that the answer is retribution. The other options either do not relate to the context of the sentence or are not consistent with the motives behind an honor killing.
The sentence mentions a bridge that is famous for being red, which implies that the bridge is a well-known landmark. Additionally, the sentence specifies that the bridge is over water, which narrows down the possible locations. California and River Valley are too broad and do not provide any specific information regarding a famous red bridge over water. Dentist and Neverland are irrelevant to the sentence and are not related to the context of the question.
A pen is a writing tool, so it is most commonly used on paper in order to write down notes, assignments, or other information. Students may also use a pen in a classroom setting during lectures or activities where writing is involved. The other options do not make as much sense since they are not typically associated with pen usage.
A department store is a type of retail establishment that offers a wide range of products, including clothing and jewelry. It is common for department stores to have multiple sections or departments, each specializing in a specific type of product. In contrast, a suitcase, safe deposit box, ring box, and vault are all containers or storage units, and do not typically offer merchandise for sale.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is an area with farms and a small stream. The term "countryside" often refers to the rural areas outside of cities and towns, which would be a fitting description of this location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when an inventory sees their idea become reality, they will gather their friends together. The word "celebrate" is the most appropriate choice as it aligns with the idea of getting together to acknowledge and enjoy the accomplishment. The other options, such as "pride" and "gratification," suggest a more personal feeling of satisfaction rather than a communal celebration. "Gamble" is not applicable to the context, and "feeling of accomplishment" is too general and does not provide a specific action.
The sentence suggests that the act of fiddling with one's shoes is not intentional, but rather a response to a physical discomfort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is referring to a medical procedure where water or other fluids are inserted into the rectum to stimulate bowel movements. This procedure is commonly known as an enema. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense as a correct answer.
The word "profane" is often used to describe something that is not sacred or holy. In contrast, the other choices have no clear association with the concept of holiness. "Halibut" is a type of fish, "damaged" refers to something that is broken or not functioning properly, "common" means something that is widespread or ordinary, and "pope holy" is not a commonly used phrase in English.
The sentence suggests that John's company is involved in selling products but doesn't have anything to do with manufacturing them. In this context, "ship goods" is the most logical choice because it implies that the company is responsible for transporting the products to their customers. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they have no clear connection to the sale of products. "Commit crime" is an obviously incorrect option, while "own resources" and "stock shelves" imply manufacturing or physical ownership of products, and "mail order" doesn't clarify how the products are delivered to customers.
The sentence implies that the games were played with a purpose beyond mere entertainment or enjoyment. The use of "help" suggests that the games were designed to improve a specific aspect of the child's development. Of the options given, "learning" is the most likely because games can be a fun and effective way to teach children new skills or information. "Competitiveness," "losing," and "winning" are less likely because they are not qualities that typically require intentional practice or instruction. "Relaxation" is also unlikely as playing games with a 5 year old can often be active and exciting.
The sentence implies that the cubicles had walls that were tall enough to create a sense of privacy and enclosure, which is a characteristic commonly associated with high walls. The other options don't fit the context of the sentence – square shape, doors and windows, and borders don't seem to relate to the physical structure of the cubicles themselves, and an apartment feels like an unlikely comparison for the setting being described.
The use of "re-illustrate" suggests that someone had already attempted to explain a point but it was insufficient. The context implies that the person being asked did not have an adequate understanding of the point to begin with, which is why it needs to be explained again. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there are rules against using sharp objects in a certain setting, and if someone reports using such an object, they would be considered a criminal for breaking the rules. The word "reports" implies that there may be consequences for using a sharp object in that specific setting, which supports the idea that the person would be considered a criminal. The other options - unobservant, above board, dull, and inaccurate, do not relate to breaking rules or the use of sharp objects in any way.
The sentence implies that the two friends were able to communicate despite their distance, which suggests the use of a communication tool that works remotely. The options "wedding," "fraternity house," and "movie" do not fit the context of two friends communicating from different countries. "Smoke signals" are not a practical or reliable communication method in modern times. Therefore, "internet cafe" is the most logical option as it is a place where one can use the internet to communicate with people remotely.
The question is asking for an indoor activity that can relieve boredom, which rules out options like skateboarding and skiing that are outdoor activities. Hanging out at a bar and laughing can be done both indoors and outdoors, so they are not specific to the question. Watching a film is a common indoor activity that people often turn to when they are bored, making it the correct answer.
The word "unscrupulous" suggests that the real estate agent is willing to behave unethically in order to make a sale. Exaggerating the positive features of the property is a common tactic that could make it seem more attractive to potential buyers. The other options -- lying, deceiving, charm, and hiring a band -- may be associated with real estate sales in other contexts, but they are less directly related to making a listing seem more attractive.
The question specifically mentions seeing a fox in Fargo, which is a city located in North Dakota. None of the other answer choices are located in North Dakota, and one of them (England) is a separate country altogether.
The sentence implies that the person is looking for a location to place a lamp that will help them see better while doing homework. The options "house" and "building" are too broad and do not provide a specific location to place the lamp. "Desktop" may be an option, but it suggests the person is using a computer, which is not mentioned in the sentence. "Nearby" is vague and could refer to anywhere in the room. "Table" is the best option as it suggests a specific surface on which the lamp can be placed to illuminate the area where the person is working.
A patio is typically an outdoor space that is made of hard, durable materials such as concrete or stone. It is likely that the surface of a patio would be best cleaned by sweeping away dirt and debris with a broom, rather than using a mop or toothbrush, which would be better suited for cleaning a softer or more delicate surface. Vacuuming may also be effective, but it may not be as efficient as sweeping, particularly if the surface is rough or uneven. Mobility is unrelated to cleaning the patio.
The sentence is asking about a potential danger when driving a car, and one of the most common and serious risks is a car crash. This is an accident that can result in various injuries, such as whiplash, broken bones, or even fatalities. The other options do not relate to the physical danger of driving a car, but rather the purpose or environmental impact.
Fish from saltwater are adapted to living in an environment with high salt levels, which is characteristic of the ocean. Rivers and brackish water have lower salt content and would not be ideal habitats for saltwater fish. Boats and aquariums are man-made environments and the happiness of a fish in these settings depends on factors other than salt content.
The sentence suggests that the doctor noticed a nerve in a patient and recommended a scan of something related to the patient. The most likely option is the human body since it is the most relevant in a medical context. The brainstem is a part of the nervous system that is located in the brain, but the context suggests that the scan is more comprehensive. The skeleton is a part of the human body, but it is not a primary focus for a nerve-related scan. Organism and animal are very broad terms that do not provide any specific information related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cat is looking for a particular type of location. Cats are known for seeking out soft, comfortable places to rest, which is likely why "soft place" is a viable option in the choices. "The place I don't want it" and "barn" are unlikely options because they suggest locations that may not be conducive to a cat's comfort or safety. "Relaxed position" is a trait or behavior, not a location. "Urban settlement" is too general and does not provide any useful information about where a cat may seek out.
When someone is sneezing a lot and has a runny nose, they are likely dealing with a cold or allergy symptoms. Blowing one's nose is a common action people take to clear out excess mucus and relieve congestion during these times. While inhaling and covering the face are also actions people may take when sneezing, they do not directly address the issue of a runny nose. Closing one's eyes is simply a reflexive response to the forceful expulsion of air during a sneeze. Spray could refer to a nasal spray, but this choice is less commonly associated with the act of sneezing and having a runny nose.
The phrase "not many people allowed to go" suggests a limited access area. Among the choices, only the space shuttle is limited in terms of the number of people who can actually go on board. The other choices, such as a street corner, supermarket or public place, do not have any clear restriction in terms of the number of people who are allowed to go. An airport may have security restrictions, but the number of people who can go is not strictly limited.
Smiling is a common facial sign of having fun, as it is a natural response to feeling happy or enjoying oneself. While laughter and pleasure can also indicate fun, they may not always manifest in a visible facial expression. Being happy is a more general emotion and does not necessarily indicate specifically having fun. Showing teeth could be a sign of aggression or a forced smile, and may not necessarily indicate having fun either.
The sentence suggests that the person being described is living in America and desires a comfortable life, which would indicate that having sufficient financial resources is a necessity for her situation. The phrase "wanting to live well" implies a standard of living that most likely requires a certain level of income. The other options, such as saying hello or drinking tea, do not relate to the context of the sentence and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
Potatoes grow in the ground, so it would make sense that they would enlarge in a garden patch or other similar outdoor growing environment. Ireland may be known for its potatoes, but it is not where a potato physically enlarges. Vegetable stew and grocery store are not places where a potato would enlarge. An optical device is not relevant to the growth of a potato.
The use of "palatial mansion" suggests that John's home is large and luxurious. It is unlikely that such a grand home would be located in a "sunny yard" or just "outside of house." "Front yard" is mentioned in the sentence but refers to the specific location John went to, not the overall location of the mansion. "Michigan" is a specific location, but the sentence does not provide any indication of where John's mansion might be located. Therefore, the most likely option is "urban area," which is a common location for large, luxurious homes.
The sentence suggests that Simon's book is missing and that his father is looking for it. Since his father has looked "everywhere," it is possible that the book may have fallen or been left on the floor. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "spa" typically refers to a place where individuals can receive various health and wellness treatments, such as massages, facials, and body wraps. Health centres are often associated with these types of services, while the other options, such as houses or backyards, are not typically associated with providing spa-like experiences. The word "leaving" in the sentence also suggests that the location they are going to is not their current location, making options like house or backyard less likely.
The sentence indicates that John and Sarah were part of a contest and that they refused to talk. It suggests that they were required to remain silent as a part of the competition. The correct answer is "silence," which is another way of saying to remain quiet or not make any sounds. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they imply the opposite of remaining silent.
The sentence refers to a specific part of the body, the bridge of the nose, which is commonly associated with wearing glasses or spectacles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that seeing artifacts repeatedly can cause a negative reaction, and specifically mentions the possibility of painful memories. This suggests that the artifacts may be connected to a traumatic event or difficult experience in the past. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the hippy girl helped him experience something beyond the physical realm. The words "tangible" and "corporeal" indicate that he had only experienced things that could be touched or felt, while the other choices suggest non-physical or abstract concepts. "Spiritual" is the best choice because it refers to matters related to the soul, faith, or higher power. The other options, such as "insubstantial" or "ethereal," do not necessarily connote a spiritual awakening.
The phrase "get some bubbly" suggests that the person is looking to celebrate or have a party. Additionally, the phrase "won big" often refers to winning a large amount of money, which would make it a prime time to celebrate. The other options, such as investing or getting money, do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The phrase "well off" typically refers to someone who is financially affluent and able to afford a comfortable lifestyle. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is "live comfortably." The other choices either do not fit with the context or have negative connotations that do not match the neutral tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was trying to escape from a place where a fire was happening, hence looking for a way out. The word "door" and the context of the sentence indicate that the person was likely searching for an exit door. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

An infestation is a term used for a large number of pests or insects that cause harm, while homes are individual dwellings and a graveyard is a place where dead people are buried. A spacecraft is a vehicle designed to travel in space. Civilization is a term used to describe a human society that has developed to a level of complexity with a large population, infrastructure, and culture. Therefore, civilization is the correct answer as it refers to a large group of human beings.
The sentence suggests that the individuals were baking in a kitchen and needed to retrieve sugar from a storage area. Cupboards are common storage areas in kitchens where ingredients and cooking utensils are stored. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is an overuse of space, which is commonly associated with cities where population densities are high and space is at a premium. The reference to condos also suggests an urban setting, as condos are typically associated with city living. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as Central Park is a park in New York City, Milwaukee is a city in Wisconsin, vacation spots are typically not associated with condos, and suburbia is not known for having an overuse of space.
A disk with software on it is typically called a "software installation disk" or a "software CD." These types of disks are sold in computer stores where consumers can purchase new software or updates to existing programs. Computer hard drives are used to store data, but they do not typically come with pre-loaded software. CD players are used for playing music or other media, but they are not used for installing software. The electronic department may include computer stores, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
The use of landmarks for navigation is a common practice in urban areas with a lot of distinctive buildings, statues, and stores. The other options such as the countryside, national park, and map, do not suggest the presence of recognizable landmarks in the same way that a city would. A neighborhood might also have landmarks, but it would not likely be as useful for navigating if one is not familiar with the area.
The term "large, professional ensemble" suggests that the context is related to music performance. The term "xylophone" also suggests that the musical instrument is being played. The term "orchestra" refers to a large group of musicians playing various instruments, including the xylophone. The other choices, such as museum, abc book, planet, and high school band, do not have any connection to the context of music performance or playing a xylophone.
The question is asking where you can see a fake or not real sloth. A picture book is a common place to see illustrations of animals, including ones that are not real. A bad dream and the universe are not typical places to see illustrations of animals, and "another place" is too vague to be a correct answer. While a zoo might seem like a possible answer, the question specifies that the sloth is not real, meaning it's not an actual animal on display at a zoo.
The question is referring to a place where multiple lawns can be found, and the option that best fits that description is a golf course. Golf courses have many different sections of grass that are meticulously maintained to different heights and styles, so there may be numerous lawns on a single course. The other options do not necessarily imply a location where lawns would be plentiful, and therefore do not fit the question as well.

The sentence suggests that the person is considering or exploring different opinions, which implies a desire to gain something. The options "revelations", "frustration", and "hesitation" do not necessarily imply a positive outcome, while "enlightenment" implies a more profound or spiritual experience than what is suggested in the sentence. "New insights" is the most fitting choice as considering different opinions is often done to gain a deeper understanding or new perspectives on a topic.
The act of procreating typically refers to sexual intercourse with the intent to have children. Biologically and psychologically, this act can release hormones that create a sense of pleasure and satisfaction, which could be described as "feeling good." The other options are not directly related to the act of procreation or would not likely be the immediate result of it.
The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where gutters and rubber hit the ground regularly, which is typically seen on a street. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A race track may have gutters, but rubber hitting it regularly is not a typical occurrence. Dirt on a bed or subway would be unlikely, and while dirt could be found on the ground, this option does not account for the presence of gutters and rubber.
The question suggests that the person is well-known for frequent farting, which may be seen as socially unacceptable behavior. The consequence of this behavior may be social ostracism, where the person is excluded from social activities or events due to their behavior. The other options, such as evil or loud noise, do not directly relate to the context of the question. The options bad smell and stinking are relevant, but they are both consequences of the behavior rather than the actual consequence the question is asking about.
The sentence suggests that Sam found the outside to be beautiful despite a particular weather condition. The most likely weather condition that would contradict this would be "rainy," as rain can often be associated with gloom and sadness. The other options, such as "repulsive" or "horrible," do not make sense in the context of finding something beautiful.
The sentence suggests that the person is studying the use of color and its various shades, which is a characteristic commonly associated with the use of monochromatic colors. Monochromatic color schemes use variations of a single hue, often adding shades of white or black to create a range of tints. Therefore, the technique being referred to in the sentence is likely the use of monochromatic color. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Airplanes are primarily used for transportation in the sky, so it is reasonable to assume that is where they usually go. The other options (war, aircraft carrier, crash, taxi) are not accurate or relevant to the context of the question.
In an auditorium, someone may be sitting on a chair that is not visible to the audience, such as a stagehand, technician, or performer waiting to enter the stage. The other options do not typically involve someone sitting on a chair out of sight in this manner.
The sentence suggests that plants are covering something, which is most commonly associated with the surface of the earth. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A greenhouse may have plants inside, but it is not covered in plants. A television and windowsill also do not have any connection to the context. A garden may have plants, but it is not mentioned specifically in the sentence.
The question is asking for an action someone can do after going to bed, which implies that they are already asleep. Therefore, the correct answer would not be an action that is typically taken before going to bed (such as making a sandwich) or a medical condition (such as pregnancy or insomnia). "Sleeping in" is a common phrase used to describe the act of continuing to sleep past one's usual wake-up time. "Drowsiness" is not an action, but a state of being that someone may feel before falling asleep.
Cows are usually kept in barnyards, which are open spaces that provide shelter and protection from predators. In a barnyard, cows can move around freely, graze on grass, and be close to other cows which is essential for their social behavior. The other options, like slaughterhouses, stables, and grocery stores, are not appropriate places for a cow to be happy at night.
A soldier is most likely to engage in combat on a battlefield, which is a location where military forces engage in conflict. Armored cars and tents may be used for transportation and shelter, respectively, but they are not specifically associated with fighting. A platoon is a group of soldiers rather than a location, and trenches are often used for defensive purposes rather than for actively engaging in combat.
Jumping rope is a cardiovascular exercise that increases the heart rate, which is beneficial for overall heart health. Getting weight is not a health benefit and can be a negative consequence if it leads to overweight or obesity. Having fun and sweating are not necessarily health benefits, although they may make exercise more enjoyable. Hopping is a synonym for jumping and does not provide any information about the health benefits of jumping rope.
The question is asking how an artist would create a fox, which suggests that the answer should relate to the process of making art. Painting is a common medium for creating animal portraits, including foxes, so it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as England or wooded areas, do not relate to the creation of art or the portrayal of foxes. "Ask them first" and "chicken coop" are irrelevant and do not make sense as answers.
Lint is a common byproduct of clothing and can often be found in places where clothing is stored or worn. A rug, purse, dryer, and pocket are all areas where lint is commonly found. However, a laundromat is a place where clothing is washed and dried, and therefore it is unlikely that there would be a significant amount of lint buildup in this location.
The word "heel" typically refers to the back end of something that is curved or angled, like the heel of your foot or the heel of a shoe. In the context of food, a "loaf of bread" is the option that makes the most sense as it has a curved back end that is sometimes referred to as the "heel" of the loaf. The other options, such as "foot" or "sandal," do not have any clear connections to food, and "shoe" and "boot" do not have any curved or angled ends that could be called a "heel."
The question asks about the location of a person when they see an apple tree. The most likely location for someone to see an apple tree is outside since apple trees are typically found in outdoor environments such as orchards, parks, or gardens. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that the showroom had a variety of automobiles, which suggests that it is a car dealership. The other options such as bathroom, appliance store, or even city are not related to the context of the sentence. The mention of Vegas is also not relevant as the location of the showroom is not being questioned, just the type of establishment it is.
The sentence suggests that the location where Bill saw the wild animal was unexpected. Out of the given options, a cafe would be the most unexpected place to encounter a wild animal. The other options, such as a zoo or park, are more likely places where one might see wild animals. The option "outside" is too general and does not provide enough context to make a guess. Woodland could be an unexpected place to see a wild animal, but the sentence suggests that it was a specific location where Bill did not expect to see a wild animal.
The sentence mentions that the plates needed to be stored in their proper place, which implies that there is a designated location for them. The options "ironing board," "restaurant," "table," and "stomach" do not make sense in this context. A shelf is a common location for storing plates, as it keeps them organized and easily accessible.
The question is asking specifically about a situation where one nurse works alongside one doctor. Out of the choices given, a doctor's office is the most likely setting where this would occur. In hospitals, there are typically more nurses assigned to a doctor, and the other options (resuscitate, reception, nursing home) do not necessarily involve a doctor-nurse partnership in the same way a doctor's office does.
The phrase "procreating goes awry" suggests a situation where more than one baby is born at the same time, also known as multiple births. Quintuplets refer to the birth of five babies at once, while multiples can refer to twins, triplets, or any other combination of multiple births. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the mail scattered in the wind, which implies that it was blown away from the mailbox. The most likely place it would land in this scenario is the nearest object that could stop or redirect its path, which in this case could be the neighbor's house. The other options, such as a mailcatcher or post office, do not make sense in this context as they are not related to the scenario of scattered mail due to wind.
The sentence indicates that the cat was wild, but like all other cats, he had a common behavior. The answer choice that fits this context is "nap," as it is a common behavior of cats. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
The mention of "monitor wall" suggests that the location being referred to is likely a place where video surveillance is used. The options of hospital, department store, and guard station do not have as strong of a connection to video surveillance as security office or studio would. Additionally, the mention of "watching moving lines" reinforces the idea of surveillance, rather than a display for entertainment purposes.
The sentence suggests that the grass did not receive any sunlight because of the car parked over it, which is likely to result in the grass being deprived of essential nutrients, leading to its death. This is a common phenomenon observed in lawns and gardens when sunlight is restricted. Turning brown is a common sign of grass dying due to lack of sunlight. The other options do not seem to be logical consequences of a lack of sunlight, except for 'dry,' which could also potentially happen.
Reading is often associated with the process of learning, especially among children who are still in the early stages of language acquisition and cognitive development. Studies have shown that reading can enhance a child's vocabulary, comprehension, and critical thinking skills, which can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall intellectual growth. The other options do not reflect the typical outcomes of reading.
The sentence suggests that the city needed a way to handle garbage waste, which implies a larger-scale solution than individual garbage cans or sewers. The options "street" and "gutter" are not appropriate solutions for managing garbage waste, and while garbage cans are a more localized solution, they would not be sufficient for managing the waste of an entire city. A garbage dump, on the other hand, is a common solution for managing large amounts of garbage waste, which makes it the most likely answer.
This question refers to a well-known nursery rhyme that goes "Pop Goes the Weasel". The rhyme describes how the monkey chases the weasel around a mulberry bush. The other answer options are not mentioned in the rhyme and do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence refers to a flower that is being stimulated by a fertilizer. This suggests that the flower will likely continue to grow and develop, eventually producing blooms, which are the colorful and fragrant parts of the plant that are meant to attract pollinators. This is a natural progression in the growth cycle of a flower, especially when aided by external factors such as fertilizers. The other options are either not related to the growth of a flower or do not accurately reflect the likely outcome in this scenario.
Throwing pennies into a water fountain is a common cultural practice often associated with making a wish for good luck. The other choices do not have a clear association with throwing pennies. "Pocket" and "jar" imply keeping pennies rather than throwing them, "worthless" suggests a negative connotation with pennies, and "copper" is simply a descriptor of the material that pennies are made from.
The sentence suggests that the boy was unable to take care of himself due to his mental state, so someone or something had to look after him. The word "tended" means to take care of or attend to someone's needs, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options, "play tricks on," "form images," "michigan," and "mindblown," do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The verb "tangled" implies that the ferret is caught or trapped in something. A petting zoo or cage would likely be designed to prevent animals from getting stuck or tangled. Similarly, an owner's home would ideally be a safe space for the ferret. The mother's hair is not a likely location for a ferret to become tangled. A trouser leg, however, could easily become twisted around a ferret as the animal explores or plays.
Phone booths used to be a common location for telephone directories, as they were frequently used for making phone calls and people needed to look up numbers. In contrast, an office or house may have a phone directory but it would typically only be for the use of the occupants. A kitchen or amusement park would seldom have a phone directory available for public use.
The context of the sentence suggests that the child is in a natural environment, specifically a meadow in spring. In this setting, it is likely that there will be flowers around, making it a natural choice for the child to gather. The other options, such as cleaning a room or setting a table, are not appropriate activities to be doing in a meadow. Additionally, the phrase "play with toys" is too general and does not provide any context-specific clues. "Forming opinions" is also not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cat is not hungry, but is bored. Based on common knowledge and experience with cats, they often seek attention and affection when bored. Therefore, stroking the cat would likely be the most appropriate action to alleviate its boredom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and may even be harmful to the cat's health.
The sentence implies that having a meal or sipping hot drinks while reading is a pleasant and relaxing activity. Therefore, it is likely that the person will feel refreshed or invigorated, rather than catching a cold, drinking coffee, gaining new knowledge, or eating dinner (which may or may not be the case, but are not directly related to the activity of reading and having a meal or drink).
The sentence implies that the process of growing an apple tree requires acquiring a physical item or location, which is commonly found in garden centers. Garden centers specialize in selling plants and gardening materials, and would be the most appropriate place to purchase an apple tree sapling. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not provide any information about where to obtain an apple tree.
The sentence suggests that the detective's task involves uncovering the truth, which often requires gathering information from witnesses. Asking questions is a common method of gathering information and can help the detective piece together the facts of the case. The other options may also be part of the detective's investigation, but they are not as directly related to gathering information from witnesses.
Well-manicured lawns are typically associated with places that prioritize upkeep and aesthetics. Golf courses are known for their pristine landscapes and manicured greens, making them a likely choice for a location with a well-manicured lawn. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of a well-manicured lawn.
The question suggests that if someone does not agree with your expression, there will be some kind of consequence or negative outcome, which is often referred to as a repercussion. Miscommunication, embarrassment, and misunderstanding may also occur, but they are more likely to be a result of a lack of clarity or understanding in the expression itself. Empowerment, on the other hand, is a positive outcome that is not likely to occur if someone disagrees with your expression.
The sentence suggests that Dan's job was solely focused on answering phone calls, which implies that he did not have time or opportunity to engage in any other activities while working. The option "draw pictures" is the only choice that represents an activity unrelated to Dan's job, and therefore it is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
In the context of therapy, communication usually refers to expressing one's thoughts and feelings openly and honestly. Talking to people directly is a common way to do this, which is why it is likely that the therapist suggested this approach. Writing in code or sending emails may not allow for the same level of emotional expression or connection with others, while listening is important but does not necessarily solve the problem of expressing oneself. "Talk with people" can be a valid alternative, but "talk to people" is a more commonly used phrase in this context.
The question is asking where it is appropriate to place an attache case, which suggests that the answer should be a location where someone might need to temporarily place and store their attache case. The options "business meeting," "hospital," and "lawyer's office" are all locations where people may need to bring an attache case, but it is not clear where in those locations it would be appropriate to place it. "Chair" is the best answer because it is a piece of furniture that someone can place an attache case on while still keeping it within reach, and "professional" is not a location, but rather a general descriptor that does not help answer the question.
Baggage searches are commonly conducted at airports as part of security measures for air travel. Helicopters, cruise ships, train stations, and rooms are all unlikely places for baggage searches to take place, as they do not have the same level of security protocols in place as airports do.
The sentence suggests that a specific location is known for its red suspension bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge, located in California, is a famous example of a red suspension bridge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a synonym for "cat," which is a type of animal. The word "feline" refers specifically to the family of cats, so it is the correct answer. The other options do not relate to cats at all - "lazy," "hungry," and "thirsty" are adjectives describing a state, and "four legs" is a physical characteristic of many animals but is not a name for a specific type of animal.
This question suggests that a violent act has occurred, specifically a stabbing that is likely to result in a pool of blood forming on the ground. The other options are not related to the context of the question and can be eliminated. Being arrested and imprisonment may be consequences of committing the violent act, but they are not related to the physical result of the action. A garden is not relevant to the context at all. The use of the word "gruesome" may be related to the violent and bloody nature of the act, but it is not a specific result and doesn't answer the question directly.
The question suggests that telling many people about someone's escapades will have a specific outcome. The word "escapades" suggests that these are adventurous or risky activities that may not be socially acceptable. Therefore, it is likely that telling many people about these activities would lead to the person becoming well-known for their behavior, which is the definition of notoriety. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the cause of Sam's confusion is related to something he suffered, which is most likely a mental or emotional condition. The word "mind" is the only option that fits this category. The other options do not have any clear connection to mental or emotional suffering.
The RGB model stands for "red, green, blue" and is a color model used for digital displays such as computer screens. Therefore, the correct answer is "red green." The other choices are colors or color combinations but are not related to the specific RGB model.
The context of the sentence suggests that the activity being described is intimate and involves physical contact with another person. Additionally, the mention of being naked further supports the idea of sexual activity. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not necessarily involve physical contact with another person or being naked.
The sentence suggests that lifting weights can improve one's wrestling skills. This is because lifting weights helps to build strength, which is an important factor in wrestling. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence describes children engaging in physical activity and showing signs of enjoyment, such as laughing. The word "fun" is commonly associated with activities that are enjoyable and entertaining, particularly for children. The other options do not make sense in the context of children playing and having a good time.
The sentence implies that the action to be taken after finishing with the television is related to its usage. Based on this, the most logical answer would be to turn it off as this is a common action taken when one finishes using a television. The other options are either unrelated or illogical given the context.
The question is asking for an action that leads to winning while competing. The options "sweat," "perform better," and "tension" describe aspects of competing but not necessarily actions that lead to winning. "Winning or losing" is a statement but not an action. "Win" is the correct answer as it directly describes the action of achieving victory in a competition.
Running a marathon (26 miles) is a physically demanding activity that can cause fatigue and exhaustion. The phrase "what does someone feel" indicates that the question is asking about a subjective experience. While sore feet may be a common consequence of running a marathon, it is not necessarily the primary feeling one would have. Death is obviously not a common outcome of running a marathon. "Twenty six" is not a feeling, it is simply the distance of the marathon. Short breath may be experienced during the run, but the question is asking about the post-run feeling.
The sentence suggests that the insects were exposed to DDT through ingestion, i.e. by eating it. DDT is an insecticide that is often used to control pests in agriculture, and it can accumulate in the food chain, making it toxic for animals that consume it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the animals were engaging in natural behaviors without any sense of embarrassment, which may imply that they were not performing any unusual or inappropriate actions. The fact that they were near water and occasionally dipped in further supports the idea that they may have been bathing. The other options (feel pain, die of cancer, copulate, attack) do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not related to the behaviors of animals by water.
The sentence suggests that being on a high cliff grants a reaching advantage, but also presents a danger of falling. The context of the sentence implies that the answer should be related to safety or caution. The options "better negotiating position," "victory," "being ahead," and "eat" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence, leaving "fall" as the correct answer.
The use of the words "sports and academic trophy cases" implies that the location is likely to be an educational institution, such as a school or a college. The phrase "entrance hall" also suggests a public building where people come and go frequently, making a school or a college a likely option. The other options, such as a large home or a convention center, do not fit the context provided in the sentence. The option "hat rack" is clearly not fitting for the context.
The sentence suggests that the mailbox is located in a place that is easily accessible from the road, which is commonly associated with mailboxes being placed in front yards. Front yards are often visible from the street and easily accessible, making them an ideal location for a mailbox. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man enjoyed doing puzzles for a specific purpose, which is likely to improve his mental abilities or keep his mind sharp. The option "mentally challenged" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it implies that the man struggles with mental disabilities. The options "challenging" and "pass time" both offer potential reasons why someone might enjoy doing puzzles, but they do not specifically address the man's motivation. Therefore, the best answer is "brain exercise."
The question is asking about a drinking vessel that can overflow if filled with too much water. The context of the question suggests that the vessel is small enough to be held easily and used for drinking. Out of the choices given, only "glass" fits this description. The other options (riverbed, sewer, drain, creek) are all larger bodies of water and not suitable for a drinking vessel.
The sentence suggests that a real estate agent may resort to dishonesty in order to achieve a sale. This is supported by the fact that greed is mentioned, which implies a desire for personal gain at any cost. Lying is a common tactic used by unscrupulous salespeople, including real estate agents, to make a property more attractive to buyers. The other options do not relate to the negative connotations associated with greed and dishonesty.
Marine grade steel cable is known for its corrosion resistance and durability in harsh maritime environments, making it ideal for use on ships. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "in love" suggests a deep emotional connection between two people, and the question is referring to what happens after they get married. "Last forever" is a common sentiment associated with marriage and the hope is that the relationship will endure for a lifetime. "Reproduce" is a possibility, but not necessarily a guarantee or expectation of all married couples. "Hurt" and "obstruct justice" have no clear connection to the question asked. "Get" is too general and doesn't provide any specific information about what happens after the couple is married.
The sentence suggests that an adult may receive payment to sit at a desk, which is a common scenario in office buildings where people work desk jobs. Libraries and schoolrooms also have desks, but adults may not typically be paid to sit at those desks unless they are librarians or teachers. Bathrooms and garage sales do not typically involve paid desk work.
When starting a new job, it is common to socialize with colleagues in order to build relationships and establish a sense of camaraderie. Meeting new people and making friends can create a supportive and enjoyable work environment, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and productivity. Small talk and talking to people are general reasons for socializing that do not specifically apply to starting a new job, while getting a raise is not typically a reason for socializing.
The question is related to working from home, so it suggests that there is a specific room that is being used for this purpose. The options bedroom and bathroom are unlikely to have a side chair for work purposes, and building and table are not specific enough. The option office is the most appropriate as it is a room usually associated with work and may have a side chair for additional seating.
The sentence suggests that people tend to keep their medicine in a specific location, and the most logical option would be the bathroom because it is a private and easily accessible space. Additionally, many medications need to be taken with water or other liquids, which are typically found in a bathroom. While medicines can also be found in a kitchen or stored in a jar, these options are less likely given the context of the sentence. A doctor's office or hospital would not be locations where people would typically keep their medicine.
The context of the sentence implies that the question is asking about a place where fish are sold. While fish can be found in oceans and streams, it is unlikely that they would be for sale there. Refrigerators are used to store food, but not to sell it. "Pay debts" does not have any relevance to the question. A market, on the other hand, is a common location where fish (and other types of food) are sold.
The sentence explicitly states that the weasel stole the chicken eggs from the farm, which suggests that the weasel was likely near a chicken coop. The fact that the weasel made its escape through something tall further supports the idea that it was near the coop, as chicken coops are typically enclosed by tall fences to protect the chickens from predators like weasels. The other options - children's story, animated film, and corn fields - have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that smoking certain drugs will not have the desired effect without a proper action. Inhaling is the necessary action needed to properly consume drugs through smoking. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the action needed to consume the drugs properly.
The use of the word "guilty" in the sentence suggests that the defendant has been found guilty of a crime, and therefore the most logical consequence would be for them to go to jail. The other options do not make sense in the context of a guilty verdict and a defendant being cuffed.
The question implies that using a driving car has a positive outcome, which narrows down the choices to "stop sign," "car crash," "pollution," and "on time." Out of those options, only "on time" is a positive result that could be achieved by using a car. The other options are negative outcomes that could result from using a car inappropriately or unsafely.
The sentence suggests that the structure had to escape the Earth's gravity, which is a characteristic commonly associated with spacecraft. The launching platform is also a clue, as spacecraft typically rely on rockets to lift off from a platform. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cars are commonly used for transportation purposes, whether it be for daily commutes, running errands, or traveling long distances. While cars may provide a sense of relaxation for some individuals, this is not their primary purpose. Car crashes may occur while driving, but this is not a reason for someone to intentionally drive a car. Similarly, driving a car does not typically involve sleeping or reducing stress.
Drinking alcohol can lead to various physical and mental effects, including impaired coordination, memory loss, and emotional instability. One of the most common and immediate effects of drinking alcohol is physical sickness, including nausea, vomiting, and headaches. This is due to the fact that alcohol is a toxin that can irritate the lining of the stomach and the digestive tract. The other options, such as blackouts, getting arrested, getting pregnant, and bad breath, do not necessarily occur immediately after drinking alcohol.
The sentence suggests that the team member would be experiencing some sort of emotional response after winning a baseball game. The other options, such as sensation or recognition, do not fit the context of the situation. While happiness and pride may be emotions a team member feels after a win, celebrating is the most specific option that directly relates to the act of celebrating a victory.
The sentence suggests that the kid is studying at home in the kitchen, so the most likely place for a dictionary would be in a shelf or bookcase in their home. The other options are less likely because they are not directly related to the context of the sentence. A dictionary could be found in a library, but the sentence does not provide any indication that the child is currently at a library. Similarly, while a table or classroom could potentially have a dictionary, the sentence does not provide any information to support these options. A bookstore may have a dictionary for sale, but the sentence suggests that the child is already studying new words, so they likely already have a dictionary available.
The sentence suggests that the person is not fond of dogs, which implies that they may prefer another type of pet. The option "with cat" is the best choice as it provides an alternative choice for a pet. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Compliments are often a source of positive reinforcement and can make a person feel good about themselves. This positive feeling may lead to a smile. On the other hand, headache and pain are unlikely to make a person smile as they are associated with discomfort. Understanding oneself and owning a house may bring a sense of satisfaction, but it is not necessarily related to making a person physically smile.
Intense exercise can cause an increase in the demand for oxygen in the body, which can lead to shortness of breath as the lungs work harder to supply enough oxygen to the body. This is a common physiological response to intense exercise and is not necessarily a cause for concern unless it persists or is accompanied by other symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Birds are known for their ability to fly, which allows them to soar high up in the sky and move freely. The other options, such as a forest or nest, suggest a confined or stationary space which does not align with the idea of freedom. The ocean may be a large space but it is not a natural environment for birds to fly in, whereas the sky is their natural habitat.
The context of the question suggests that not returning to work could have negative consequences. "Sobering" and "anxiety" may be emotional reactions to this situation, but they do not explain the specific consequences. "Stress" may be a consequence, but it is not as severe as losing one's job. "Earn money" is a potential goal of returning to work, but it does not answer the question or describe a consequence of not returning to work.
The sentence suggests that the person needed a light source to navigate a spiral staircase, which is a feature commonly found in lighthouses. Lighthouses are tall structures that guide ships through dangerous waters, and they often have spiral staircases leading up to the top of the tower. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the aggressive soldiers were becoming intoxicated and that they were in the company of locals. Given that they are already described as aggressive, it is likely that they may engage in fights with the locals while under the influence of alcohol. The other options do not have any clear association to the context of the sentence.
Corn on the cob is typically served as a side dish during dinner meals, especially during summer cookouts or BBQs. It is less commonly served during breakfast or in supermarkets/shops, and the option "country" does not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
Playing ball can have a variety of outcomes, including both positive (making a touchdown, having fun) and negative (injury, losing) ones. Competition is also a potential outcome, as many ball games involve teams competing against each other. Understanding the context and purpose of playing ball can also aid in choosing the correct answer. For example, if the question is asking about the potential outcomes of playing ball as a leisure activity, then having fun may be the most likely answer. However, if the question is asking about the potential outcomes of playing ball in a competitive setting, then competition, winning, and losing may be more relevant answers.
The sentence suggests that Joe had some kind of advantage or influence at the company due to his connections. The option "own resources" refers to Joe having his own valuable assets or personal resources that could be utilized for the company's benefit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the end result or purpose of working hard towards a goal. The word "accomplishment" refers to successfully completing a task or achieving a goal, and is therefore the correct answer. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as they do not directly relate to the achievement of a goal.
The sentence provides information about each person's musical role, with John playing a stringed instrument, Billy as the singer, James as the drummer, and Vince playing the keyboard and piano. These roles are typically found in a rock band, which often includes these instruments. The other options, such as string quartet or music store, do not fit the description given in the sentence. Bored is also not a likely option, as the sentence does not suggest that the individuals were feeling uninterested or unengaged. Concert is a possibility, but it is too broad of a category without additional context.
The question is asking about an individual who is most likely to be successful. Out of the provided choices, the word "cleverest" is the most relevant, as intelligence is often associated with success. The other options - "bitterest," "representative," "bunny rabbit," and "corrupt" - do not have a clear connection to success.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is reminiscing about his past experiences in high school. The phrase "playing cornet" implies that he was a musician, and "yearbook" suggests that he is looking at photos and memories from his high school years. The choice "high school band" makes sense as it connects with the context of the sentence, while the other options have no clear connection.
The question is asking about what people do for their guests, which suggests something hospitable or welcoming. The sentence specifically mentions cooking, which is a common activity when hosting guests. While talking and learning from each other may also be social activities during a gathering, demanding justice does not seem relevant to the context. Share food may also be an option, but the use of the word "for" implies a more active role in preparing the food rather than just offering to share.
The nose is the primary organ used for smelling things. It contains specialized cells that detect different types of odor molecules and sends signals to the brain, allowing us to identify and distinguish between different smells. The other options do not have any connection to the sense of smell or the question being asked.
A cedar chest is a common piece of furniture used for storing bedding, such as blankets and comforters. It is unlikely to find a comforter in a living room or outside, and it is inappropriate to find one in a baby's mouth. "World" is too broad and does not provide any context for where a comforter would be found.
State fairs often have agricultural and livestock exhibitions, including horse shows. The other choices do not have a clear association with horse shows or public celebrations in general.
The sentence implies that marmots have a natural habitat outside of buildings. It then gives five options, and the correct answer requires knowledge about marmot habitats. Marmots are burrowing mammals that are typically found in rocky mountainous areas, so the answer is likely to be the rocky hillside. The other options do not align with the natural habitat of marmots.
A rubber stamp is commonly used in office settings for tasks such as stamping documents or envelopes with a signature or company logo. While it is possible that a craft store or art class may use rubber stamps for creative purposes, these settings are not typically associated with using a signature stamp for official business. The state of Indiana is not relevant to the context of the question. The word "made" is too vague and doesn't provide any contextual clues as to where someone with a signature rubber stamp would work.
The sentence suggests that the all-star player wasn't playing at full capacity due to something that affected his physical condition. "Trauma" and "injury" are both related to physical harm or damage, which could explain why the player wasn't at his best. "Having fun" and "pleasure" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, and "throwing" does not seem to fit with the idea of an injury affecting the player's performance.
The question asks for something that is commonly made of nylon, which is a synthetic polymer material that is known for its strength, durability, and elasticity. While women's leggings are one specific product that is commonly made of nylon, the word "other" in the question implies that there are other items as well. Nylon is used in a wide range of products, including stockings, ropes, shoes, and many other things. Therefore, the correct answer is "many products".
The sentence implies that people are looking to purchase fruit, and the most likely place for them to do so is at a market. Markets are commonly associated with selling fresh produce, including fruits and vegetables. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John is looking for shade, which means he is probably in a place where the sun is shining directly on him. The options "sunny place," "summer," "bright sunshine," and "full sunlight" all describe sunny conditions, but only "direct sunlight" specifically refers to being in the path of the sun's rays.
The sentence suggests that Sam's garbage can is blocking something that is causing annoyance to other people. The most likely option is the street since garbage cans are usually placed on the street for garbage trucks to pick up. The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that union workers were on strike and then they went off strike. This means that their demands, which caused the strike in the first place, must have been met by the management. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. If the company had closed, the union workers would not have gone off strike. If the management had given more money, the union workers would have been happy and not gone on strike in the first place. If complaints had been addressed, there would have been no reason for the strike to continue. If the union workers had been told to get back to work without their demands being met, they would not have complied.
The sentence suggests that the person is working hard in order to provide for themselves or their family, indicating a desire or need for financial stability. The option "earning money" best fits this context, while the other choices do not make sense in relation to the sentence. "Prosperity" could be a potential answer, but it is too broad and not specific enough in this context.
The sentence suggests that the cats are laying by the refrigerator for a particular reason. One possible reason is that they like the warmth given off by the appliance. Cats are known to seek out warm places to rest, and refrigerators often emit heat from the compressors on their backs. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the cats are laying by the refrigerator.
The question is asking where glue will stay usable, which implies that there are certain conditions that will keep the glue in good condition. The correct answer is "closed container" because once opened, glue can dry out or harden if left exposed to air. This is why it's important to keep glue tightly sealed when not in use. The other options, such as "art room" or "desk drawer," don't necessarily provide the necessary conditions for preserving the glue's usability. "Sticky" is not a location and "cabinet" gives no indication of whether the container is open or closed, so these options can be eliminated.
The sentence suggests that the police chief had to answer questions from the press for a long time, which could be a frustrating and exhausting experience. The word "hours" implies that it was a prolonged period of time, which adds to the likelihood that the police chief felt irritated. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that the police chief felt sad, polite, teaching, or detective-like after answering questions from the press.
The sentence suggests that Mal is doing something to cover a hole at night, but he is also leaving something for his cats. Since cats often require access to certain areas of the house for their litter boxes or food and water bowls, it is reasonable to assume that Mal is leaving an opening or access point for his cats. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence.
A marmot is a type of ground squirrel that is typically found in mountainous areas and other remote wilderness habitats. Therefore, a marmot would feel most confined in a petting zoo, which is an artificial environment that is far removed from its natural habitat. The other options are all places where a marmot could potentially live or thrive.
The sentence states that Sam's life started in 1918, and he is reflecting on his long life. Since the current year is 2021, it can be inferred that Sam has lived for at least 100 years. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A suburban neighborhood typically consists of houses with backyards, so it is possible for there to be thousands or even millions of back gardens in a large suburban area. Apartments usually do not have individual backyards, and cities in general may have limited space for individual gardens. While England may have many suburban neighborhoods, it is not a defining characteristic of the country itself.
The word "net" is commonly associated with fishing, as it is a tool used to catch fish. The other options do not have any clear connection to the word "net".
Each of the choices suggests a way to avoid feeling lonely while out for coffee by engaging in social interaction with others, either by meeting new people or spending time with existing friends. The question does not provide enough context to narrow the answer down to a single correct choice.
The sentence clearly states that John drove interesting people away, implying that he did or said something that caused them to not want to be around him. Being more social or exploring may help him meet more people, but it is unlikely to address the issue of driving them away. Taking a class or trying to understand people better may be helpful, but being friendly is the most straightforward way to make people feel comfortable around him.
In this sentence, the grandpa is trying to show the child what a mammoth is. The most likely source of information in this context would be an encyclopedia, which is a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of topics, including prehistoric animals like mammoths. The other options do not make sense in this context - ancient times and excavations might be related to the subject matter, but they are not things that the grandpa would bring out to show the child. South Dakota and backyard do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that sharks can be found in a variety of locations, and the term "great oceans" refers to the world's largest bodies of saltwater, such as the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Sharks are known to inhabit these waters and can pose a threat to humans who encounter them. The other choices, such as "tropical waters," "sea world," "great outdoors," and "Lake Michigan" are not accurate because they do not encompass where sharks are typically found.
The sentence implies that John was putting in extra effort to make his vehicle look its best, which suggests that he was preparing it for public display. Additionally, the option "car show" specifically mentions an event where people showcase their cars, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "home" or "repair shop," do not provide a reason for why John would be spending so much time polishing his tires.
The context suggests that the entertainment option should not require electricity, which rules out watching a film or seeing a favorite show. Playing chess may require a board and pieces, which may not be readily available, whereas playing cards only requires a deck of cards. Surfing the net requires electricity and an internet connection, which is not available in this scenario. Therefore, playing cards is the most appropriate option for entertainment in this situation.
The question is asking for a location where there are millions of blowfish, which suggests that blowfish are found in large numbers in this location. The Atlantic Ocean is a large body of water that spans over several countries and is home to a diverse range of marine life, including blowfish. The other options, such as jungle, Cuba, sea water, and lake, do not have any clear association with blowfish or their habitat.

The question is asking what can be made with one's voice, suggesting that it refers to a musical or vocal endeavor rather than a tool or technology like a radio or telephone. Silence is not something that can be made with one's voice. A song is a possible answer but not the only one, and there is a specific reference to a group effort with "you" implying a shared activity rather than an individual performance. A choir is a group of singers who perform together using their voices, making it the most likely answer among the choices.
Typically, books are written about people who have made significant contributions or accomplishments in their respective fields, or who are historically significant. These individuals are often referred to as "important" people, and their stories are considered worth telling. While it is possible for a book to be written about someone who is entertaining or engaging, these characteristics alone are not typically enough to warrant an entire book. Similarly, being rich or having a book written on paper do not necessarily have any bearing on whether or not someone is book-worthy.
The sentence suggests that the person was set to perform something that had multiple lines or verses, and the issue was specifically with remembering the final one. A stanza is a group of lines in poetry or song lyrics, and it is common for performers to struggle with remembering the last one. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking what a Christian student would do if they are not good at learning. In this context, it is safe to assume that the answer should reflect the teachings of the Christian faith. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be "believe in Jesus Christ," as this is a core belief in Christianity and signifies a commitment to have faith that God will provide guidance and support in all aspects of life, including education. The other options, such as "fail" or "give up," are negative and suggest a lack of effort, while "commit sin" and "rebel" are inappropriate as solutions to academic challenges.
The sentence suggests that changing society requires some form of personal transformation or self-reflection. This idea aligns with the common belief that societal change begins with individual change. The other options are not necessarily required steps in changing society, and in some cases, may even be counterproductive. For example, riots may lead to destruction and violence, which would not be an effective means of changing society in most cases.
The sentence suggests that the man is talented in both singing alto and playing an instrument, and that he is involved in a group or organization that involves both activities. The word "choir" is the most logical choice because it is a musical group that involves singing and often includes musical accompaniment. The other options, while involving music in some way, do not necessarily involve singing or playing an instrument in combination.
Fishing typically requires a fishing rod to cast a line and reel in a fish, access to water where fish are present, and bate to attract the fish. Having three hands or tackle is not necessary for fishing and is not mentioned in the context of the question.
Computer science is a field that involves programming and computer systems. Therefore, it is logical to assume that someone who majors in computer science would be interested in a career that involves writing programs or developing software. The other options have no clear connection to the field of computer science.
The sentence suggests that if you want expert information about germs, you should talk to a certain type of person. The most likely expert on germs would be a doctor, as they have extensive medical training and should be knowledgeable about the spread of disease. The other options either do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not likely to be experts on germs.
While snakes can be found in tropical forests and fields, these are not locations where one typically buys a pet snake. Walmart is a retail store that may sell some pet supplies, but it is unlikely to be a primary source for purchasing snakes. On the other hand, pet shops are commonly known to sell a variety of reptiles, including snakes, making it the most likely choice for where to buy a pet snake.
When a person buys food from a grocery store, the typical action is to bring the food home. This is because the food is usually intended for consumption at home. The other options do not make sense in the context of buying food from a grocery store.
Since honey is a liquid, the most practical option for storing it would be in a jar with a lid. This will prevent the honey from spilling or attracting pests like ants. The other options do not make sense in the context of storing honey. "Stick to fingers" is not a storage option but rather a result of handling honey. "Farmer's market" refers to a place where goods are sold but not stored. "Beehive" is where bees produce honey rather than where it's stored. "House" is too broad and does not answer the question specifically.
When a teacher asks their students to "listen," it typically means that they want the students to focus and actively engage with what is being said. The other options may be related to listening, but they do not fully capture the meaning of actively engaging with someone speaking to you. For example, being able to hear simply means that sound reaches your ears, but it doesn't necessarily suggest active engagement with the speaker. Similarly, having your eyes on the teacher may show that you are physically present and looking in their direction, but it doesn't necessarily capture the idea of actively listening and engaging with them.
The question is asking for something that every person has that allows them to feel, which suggests that it is related to the ability to experience emotions. The other options (mother and father, heart, name, mouth) do not have a clear connection to the concept of feeling.
The sentence suggests that Simon's instructions were hard to understand, which can be described as confusing. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not accurately describe the difficulty of understanding instructions.
The use of a chain to move the back wheel is a common feature of motorcycles, also known as motorbikes. The other options, such as cars and tow trucks, typically use a driveshaft or other mechanical systems to power the wheels, while bicycles are powered by pedals. The term "gear shift" can apply to a range of vehicles and does not provide clear information about the type of vehicle being described.
The question is asking what is necessary in order to buy presents for others, which implies a need for a certain amount of money. The options "spend money" and "earn money" suggest actions that can lead to having money, but do not guarantee the presence of money. "Generosity" and "generous" suggest a willingness to give, but do not address the practical matter of having the means to give. Therefore, the correct answer is "have money" as it directly addresses the requirement for purchasing gifts.
The phrase "taken aback" suggests that the woman was surprised or shocked by something unexpected. The sentence implies that her previous boyfriends were not like the man she is currently interacting with, which suggests that they may have been imaginary or fictional. The word "imaginary" is the most fitting answer as it describes something that exists only in the imagination or mind. The other choices, such as fictitious or artificial, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The other options may be related to a couple's relationship, but the sentence specifically mentions something that is important for them to do. Communication is often cited as a crucial aspect of a healthy and successful relationship. The other options may also be important, but they don't necessarily address the importance of communication in the same way.
The phrase "hot weather was unbearable" implies that the person is experiencing discomfort due to the temperature. To alleviate this discomfort, the person needs to find a way to reduce their body temperature. Options like "eat ice cream" and "lemonade" provide temporary relief, but they don't actually cool the body. "Swim" could provide relief, but it's not clear whether the person has access to a pool or body of water. "Cut hair" is not relevant to the context. "Cool off" is the most logical choice as it directly addresses the need to reduce body temperature.
Ficus plants require well-draining soil and good air circulation around their roots. Clay pots are a popular choice for planting ficus because they allow excess moisture to evaporate and provide good air flow. Refrigerators and shady places would not be appropriate for a plant that needs sunlight to thrive. A screened porch or arboretum could be suitable locations for a ficus, but the question is specifically about the container needed, not the location of the plant.
The sentence indicates that Bobby's action of jumping off the slide had negative consequences when he landed. The word "injuries" suggests physical harm or damage, which makes sense in the context of jumping off a playground slide. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the words "glee" and "being happy" have a positive connotation that does not fit with the idea of Bobby's action having negative consequences.
When skin is exposed to water for prolonged periods of time, it can become wrinkled due to water absorption. This is a common physiological response and is not harmful in moderate amounts. The other options do not have any relation to the physiological effects of prolonged exposure to water.
The sentence indicates that the performer fell off the stage, which implies that they sustained some form of physical harm. Injury is therefore the most logical choice among the options given. Fear and butterflies are emotions that are unlikely to be caused by falling off a stage, while pride and action do not relate to the negative outcome suggested by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that coaches are commonly seen in a specific type of event or activity that is likely associated with either European or South American culture. The options "play football," "sporting event," and "soccer game" are all related to sports, which are popular in both regions. However, football (or soccer) is especially popular in Europe and South America, making "soccer game" the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence mentions a sermon, which is typically associated with religious settings like churches. Folding chairs are commonly used in churches for events like sermons, so it is likely that the setting in this sentence is a church. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person did not find themselves beautiful despite being told otherwise. The word "hideous" implies a strong negative feeling towards one's appearance. The other options do not convey a strong negative connotation and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
The internet is a common tool for finding companies nowadays. It allows for easy access to company websites, directories, and online reviews. The other options are less commonly used, and some (such as armed forces) are not related to finding companies at all. Yellow pages and phone books were frequently used in the past but are becoming increasingly obsolete with the rise of digital technology.
The question specifically mentions that beavers are native to the northwest of North America, which includes Canada. British Columbia is a province located in the westernmost part of Canada and is known for its extensive forests, making it a likely habitat for beavers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam had tickets to a concert hall, which is typically associated with loud music. Sam did not like going to the concert hall because of the loud noise, which suggests that he may prefer a quieter setting for entertainment. A theater often offers a more controlled environment with softer sounds, making it a reasonable choice for Sam to trade his tickets for. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that although Susan was an ordinary person, her skills were not ordinary, which implies that her skills were above average or outstanding. The word "exceptional" fits this context as it means unusually good, outstanding, or remarkable. The other options like "strange" or "unusual" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Spectacular" and "special" are not necessarily negative, but they do not have the same connotation of being outstanding or exceptional that the sentence implies.
Marmots are typically found in colder regions such as the mountains of Europe, Asia, and North America. They prefer alpine and subalpine habitats, which are found in northern climates. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the boy enjoys surprising his mother, which could either result in her laughing or being scared. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would not make sense in the given context.
Bleachers are often associated with seating in a gymnasium or other indoor sports facility. They are typically arranged in rows to maximize seating capacity and provide a clear view of the playing area. The other options do not involve indoor seating or sports facilities.
The sentence implies that James and Sarah were looking for an alternative place to spend their time because their usual spot was muddy. The word "playground" is the only option that fits this description, as it is a common outdoor area where people go to have fun and play. The other options, such as "highway", "town", and "mexico", do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for comfort and familiarity, which is often associated with one's own home. Home is a place where a person can feel safe, secure, and comfortable, surrounded by their own belongings and familiar surroundings. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not offer the same level of comfort and familiarity as home.
The keyword "cold" in the question suggests that the animal being referred to is adapted to living in cooler temperatures. The keyword "tall" suggests that the animal may be adapted to living at higher elevations. Marmosets are typically found in the mountains of Central and South America, which are relatively cooler and higher in elevation compared to other areas listed in the answer choices. The other options do not have a clear association with the habitat preferences of a marmoset.
The sentence mentions "outback tour guide," which suggests that the location being referred to is in Australia, as the term "outback" is commonly associated with that country. Additionally, the mention of prairie dogs ties them to North America, which further supports the idea that the speaker is in a different location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James dislikes using something that involves being underground or buried in dirt. The option "subway" fits this context as it is a mode of transportation that often involves underground tunnels. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone is looking for a place to have a drink and watch comedy. While one could potentially have a drink and watch comedy at a dinner or show, these options are less common than going to a bar or comedy club. The cinema and refrigerator are not logical options since one does not typically watch live comedy in either of those locations.
The context of the sentence suggests that the surprise party was unsuccessful because the guest of honor already knew about it. The other options do not fit with the sentence since they do not suggest that the guest of honor was aware of the party beforehand. "Foreshadowed" suggests that the party was hinted at beforehand, "sneaky" suggests the party-throwers were secretive in their planning, and "hiding" suggests the guest of honor was hiding from the party.
When guns get wet, the water may cause the gunpowder to become damp and less effective, leading to misfires or failure to fire. Explosions are rare and usually only occur if the gun is severely damaged or if the ammunition has been tampered with. Jams can occur if debris or moisture gets into the gun's action, causing it to malfunction. Guns can break if they are not properly maintained, but it is not a common occurrence when they get wet. "Take life" is not a potential effect on the gun itself but instead an outcome of the gun being fired.
The sentence implies that buying a house is a significant step towards establishing a permanent home for one's family, which is often associated with the idea of "settling down." "Make money" and "lose money" are not related to the context of buying a house for the family, while "closet space" and "pay for" are possible considerations when buying a house but do not capture the overall purpose of the decision.
The phrase "out of stock" implies that the product was not available for purchase. Therefore, if the product has been restocked, it is now available once again. The other choices, such as "plenty," "empty," and "abundant," do not suggest that the product is available for purchase again. "Plentiful" and "plenty" suggest that there is a large amount of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase. "Empty" implies that there is nothing left or available, and "abundant" suggests that there is a lot of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase.
The question asks about the emotional response a person should feel when performing a responsible action with their pet, specifically walking a dog. Walking a dog is a healthy activity for both the dog and the owner, and spending time with a beloved pet can boost feelings of happiness and satisfaction. The other options, such as sore feet, tiredness, and exercise, may be physical outcomes of walking a dog, but do not necessarily relate to the emotional response that a person should feel. Pride may be a positive emotion associated with being a responsible pet owner, but is not necessarily linked to the act of walking a dog.
The word "entertaining" suggests that the show was enjoyable to Jane. Since the other emotions listed are negative or neutral, it can be inferred that Jane experienced a positive emotion while watching the show. "Laughter" is commonly associated with enjoyment and entertainment, and it fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context.
Escalators are typically distinguished from stairs based on their ability to move. Unlike stairs, which are stationary, escalators have a motorized mechanism that causes them to move in a continuous motion, bringing people up or down. The other options, such as "eat cake" or "department store," do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "crash" in the context of a computer typically refers to a sudden, unforeseen failure or malfunction. This can be frustrating and disruptive, leading to feelings of anger or despair. As such, the choice "hell" is a likely option for a computer user's perspective on a computer crash. The other options (own home, school, work, house) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that Sam was an alcoholic and was injured in a car crash suggests that the crash was likely related to his drinking. Bridges are often associated with drinking and driving accidents, as they are typically located on busy roads or highways and can be more difficult to navigate when impaired. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence contrasts Mars with something that has a variety of features, which suggests that the correct answer must also have a diverse range of components. The surface of Earth contains a variety of materials, such as soil, rocks, water, and vegetation, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not have diverse features (e.g. potato and desktop), or are unrelated to the topic (e.g. library and most buildings).
The sentence indicates that the racer received a penalty for leaving the line early, which is a violation of the rules. The penalty for a false start is usually a punishment, such as a time penalty or a disqualification, rather than arguing or trouble. The official's countdown may not have any effect on the punishment, although it could result in further delays if the racer continues to make false starts. Starting over is unlikely to be an option, as the race has already begun.
The question is asking for a specific state that is known for its BBQ. "Delta state" may refer to a state located in the Mississippi Delta region, which includes Louisiana. Louisiana is known for its Cajun-style BBQ, which is heavily influenced by French, African, and Native American cuisine. The other options do not provide any information that would suggest they are known for BBQ.
Rosebushes are often used as decorative plants in landscaping, such as in gardens, parks, and along walkways. Courtyards and botanic gardens may also have rosebushes, but the word "typically" suggests that landscaping is the most common location. Mailboxes and California have no clear connection to rosebushes.
The question is asking about the first thing a spouse might do when they get up early, which implies that the spouse is already awake. Therefore, options that involve going to bed early or getting to bed early do not make sense. Additionally, asking the spouse to wake up does not fit the context of the sentence, which suggests that the spouse is already awake. Therefore, the correct answer is "wake up."
Marmosets are small primates that are typically found in the tropical rainforests of South America. The other choices are not associated with the natural habitat of marmosets. France is a country, but it is not known for having marmosets. Trees, wilderness, and mountains are all natural features, but they do not provide information about where marmosets come from.
The sentence suggests that in modern times, there is a classification given to buildings to protect them from being town down. This classification is intended to protect buildings that are significant in history, which implies that the correct answer must have something to do with history. Out of the options given, "historical" best fits the context. The other options allude to the age or style of the buildings, but they do not specifically refer to the significance of the buildings in history.
The sentence mentions fruit growing areas, and apple trees are commonly grown in these areas. Washington state is known for its apple orchards, farmland can contain apple trees, and grape vineyards may also have apple trees. Vineyards may be dedicated solely to grapes, but it is still possible to grow apple trees in the surrounding area. Orchid is not a fruit, and therefore would not be a likely location for an apple tree.
The sentence describes the man and woman chipping the wood for their garden, which would likely leave it with rough edges or surfaces. The word "then" suggests that the sentence is describing a subsequent action. Sanding is a common practice for smoothing rough surfaces, so it would make sense for the man and woman to sand the wood after chipping it. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
Sloths are native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where they spend much of their time sleeping in trees. The forest canopy is their natural habitat, and the damp climate of the rainforest provides the perfect environment for their slow-moving, relaxed lifestyle. The other options are less likely to be associated with sloths or their preferred habitats.
The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is a type of alcoholic beverage. Beer is commonly known to have an alcohol content of around 4.5%, while wine can range from 5-15% depending on the type. A pub is a place where alcoholic drinks are served, but it is not a specific type of drink. Uncle Joe and fraternity house are not relevant options in this context.
The sentence mentions a city's Christmas party, which suggests a larger gathering that likely wouldn't be held in someone's home or automobile. The use of the term "public building" implies that the party was being held in a location such as a community center or town hall, as opposed to a privately-owned building like a house or train.
Parks often have large open spaces that can be used for recreational activities such as soccer. This is a common feature of many urban parks, which are designed specifically to provide residents with a place to relax and engage in physical activity. The other options do not offer the same level of open space or amenities that would make them suitable for a soccer field. Beaches, for example, are often crowded and have limited space, while playgrounds are typically designed for children and may not be large enough for a full-size soccer field. Mexico and the countryside are also unlikely to be viable options, as they are not specific locations and do not offer any particular advantages for building a soccer field in a crowded city.
When someone is looking for a drink, they are typically referring to an alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine or a cocktail, which are commonly served in bars. China is a country, not a place where one would get a drink, and brothels and theaters are not typical places to get a drink unless they have a bar on site. A space shuttle does not serve drinks to its passengers.
The sentence suggests that the Daily Planet and Jimmy's subway stop are both located in the same city. "New York City" is a well-known metropolis and home to the fictional Daily Planet from the Superman comics, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
After a farmer has made things grow, the next step is usually to harvest the crops. Harvesting refers to the process of gathering mature crops from the fields and preparing them for sale or consumption. The other options may be related to the process of growing crops, but they are not the final step that a farmer would take. Flowering and blooms are stages of plant growth, planting is the initial step, and growth is a general term that could refer to any stage of the process.
Digestion is the process by which our body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into our bloodstream and used for energy, growth, and repair. Good digestion is essential for the body to properly absorb nutrients and eliminate waste. Eating is the process of putting food in our mouth, and sore mouth and toothache are conditions that may affect the ability to chew and swallow food, but they do not affect the process of digestion itself. Aid digestion may refer to medications or supplements that assist the digestive process, but the sentence is not referring to these interventions.
The sentence suggests that Billy called out to John with the expectation of hearing something in return, which is a characteristic commonly associated with seeking a response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Ben doesn't have much respect for Sue and would act in a way that is contrary to her wishes. "Disregard" means to ignore or pay no attention to, which fits the context of the sentence. "Throw away" and "humiliate" do not fit the context and seem too extreme. "Being rude" is not specific enough and could apply to a variety of actions. "Abhor" means to hate or detest, which doesn't make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person on the phone was sick and the speaker could no longer hear the sickness in their voice. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker said something positive or reassuring, such as "sound well." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A pet lizard should be kept in a glass cage or tank, as it provides a secure and controlled environment that allows for temperature regulation and protection from predators. The other options are either unsuitable habitats for most pet lizards (such as the desert or wild) or are not relevant to the context of the question (such as the Galapagos Archipelago or garden).
The sentence suggests that Billy's characteristic of being "kooky" has no relation to his sexual orientation, specifically not being gay. The word "straight" is commonly used to refer to someone who is heterosexual, so it is the best option that accurately describes Billy's sexual orientation based on the given sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that people are having trouble finding enough resources to fulfill their calorie requirements, which suggests that they are struggling to obtain enough food. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is related to obtaining food. "Feed themselves" is the only option that directly mentions obtaining food, while the other options are either unrelated or imply conflict between people.
The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence that occurs when people play sports for too long. Since the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, we can eliminate them. Running and cheating are both actions that could potentially happen during sports, but they are not necessarily related to the negative consequence mentioned in the sentence. Having fun is generally considered a positive outcome of playing sports, so it is also not a likely answer. Finally, breaking out in purple polka dots is an absurd option that is clearly meant to be humorous, but it does not provide any useful information for choosing the correct answer. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is getting tired, which is a common consequence of physical activity.
The sentence suggests that the animal being referred to is a monkey and that it is native to a place without people. Given this information, it is most likely that the monkey is found in a natural habitat rather than a research laboratory. The options "south africa" and "Canada" are geographic locations, but they do not provide any information on where monkeys can be found. "Playful mood" is not a place, and is not relevant to the question. "Rain forest" is a type of natural habitat, which is commonly associated with primates such as monkeys. Therefore, "rain forest" is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence tells us that John did not like to get in line, which suggests that he was tired or exhausted from working for a long time. Fatigue is commonly associated with physical and mental exhaustion, which can make waiting in line feel more difficult and uncomfortable. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The act of raising one's hand in a classroom setting typically indicates the desire to answer a question or provide a comment. The other options, such as completing a test, reading a book, or studying a book, do not involve raising one's hand in the same way that answering a question does. "Died" is clearly not a valid option as no one would raise their hand in response to someone dying.
Computer speakers are typically kept on the desktop, which is the surface on which the computer monitor and other hardware sits. This is because the speakers are designed to produce sound for the computer, so they need to be in close proximity to the user. The other options do not make sense in the context of where computer speakers would be kept.
The sentence states that Sally only rides her bike less than once per year, which implies that she does it very rarely or infrequently. The other options, such as sometimes, usually, seldom, and occasionally, do not accurately describe her bike-riding habits based on the given information.
Stop signs are used to regulate traffic flow and require drivers to come to a complete stop before proceeding. Therefore, slowing down is the appropriate action to take when approaching a stop sign. Going fast, rolling over, crashing, or flying are all unsafe and illegal actions that could result in serious consequences.
The context of the sentence suggests that the excavation was related to a murder case, which implies that the location must be related to either the victim or the suspect. The option "cemetary" is the most likely answer as it is a common location for burial of bodies, including murder victims. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "hot" suggests that the monkeys prefer a warm climate. "Tropical areas" are known for having warm and humid weather, making it a suitable habitat for many monkey species. "Rain forest" may also be a suitable habitat for monkeys, but the choice of the word "hot" makes "tropical areas" a more likely answer. "Tree tops" and "treetops" are not habitats themselves, but rather a location within a habitat, and "great outdoors" is too broad of a term.
While books and classes are common sources of knowledge, the question asks for sources other than school or text. Meetings are a source of knowledge because they provide an opportunity for individuals to share their experiences and expertise with others. Meetings can also serve as a forum to discuss new ideas and learn from others. "Thinking" and "head" are not sources of knowledge, but rather describe a potential internal process.
The sentence suggests that the soldiers are preparing to confront the invading soldiers with hostility, which is commonly associated with fighting. The phrase "raise their rifles" also implies a readiness for combat. The other options do not fit the context and tone of the sentence, as they do not involve an aggressive or confrontational approach to the invading soldiers.
The question is asking about a common activity that people in a family do during holidays. Gathering together is a common tradition among families during holidays, where they come together to celebrate and spend time with each other. Getting angry or facing each other do not necessarily relate to holiday traditions, while running a race is a specific activity that not all families may do. Talking to each other may occur during holiday gatherings, but it is not unique to holiday traditions.
The question is asking about something that goes on the floor, and of the given options, "house" is the only item that would typically be placed on a floor. "Closet" and "pet shop" are places, "table" and "desk" are furniture pieces that typically go on a floor but not directly on it.
The sentence suggests that individuals who have difficulty communicating with others are struggling with the act of communicating itself. The options "listen," "speak out," and "talk to people" are all specific actions related to communication, but they do not encompass the concept of communication difficulty as a whole. "Talk with people" is a more accurate option, but it is redundant with the phrase "communicate with others." "Having confidence" may contribute to communication difficulty, but it is not the root cause.
The sentence suggests that when two sides work together to come closer, reaching a tentative agreement is the first result. This implies that compromises must be made in order to reach an agreement. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, and therefore are incorrect.
The sentence suggests that the cabin is larger than it appears at first glance and is actually made up of multiple rooms. The word "connected" also implies that there is some sort of passageway or hallway that links these rooms together. The word "bunkrooms" suggests that the cabin may be used for lodging or sleeping arrangements, further supporting the idea that it is made up of multiple smaller rooms. The other options, such as palace, spacecraft, and villa, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
A card catalog is a system used by libraries to organize their materials, such as books, magazines or journals. Users can search for a particular item by author, title or subject and find its location within the library. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of a card catalog.
When people are competing, the main goal is usually to win. However, it is also possible to lose or be defeated. This outcome is often associated with feelings of disappointment, sadness, and frustration. The other options, such as enemies and humiliation, are not necessarily outcomes of competition in general and may not be directly related to the context of the sentence. Aggression and stress are potential effects of competition but are not necessarily outcomes in and of themselves.
The sentence mentions a plane on a runway with civilians inside, which suggests that the plane is most likely a civilian aircraft, as military aircraft rarely transport civilians. The word "bound" suggests that the plane is departing for a specific destination, which is most likely an airfield or airport. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that water is being used as a mirror, which is a design feature commonly associated with reflecting pools. Reflecting pools are often used in landscape architecture to create a calm and reflective surface that enhances the aesthetic and natural beauty of a surrounding area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would not typically be used as a mirror in a design context.
The sentence suggests that Amy is sitting down and turning on her monitor to do work, which is most likely done on a desktop computer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that she is using a box, on a train, at an internet cafe, or viewing a bluescreen.
Performing in front of a large number of people is commonly associated with musicians playing music for a live audience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When an injury occurs, it is important to prevent it from becoming worse and becoming infected. Allowing an injury to become worse can lead to more damage to the affected area, making it harder to heal. Infection can also occur if the wound is not properly cleaned and protected. While hurting is a common symptom of an injury, it is not something that can necessarily be prevented. Similarly, bleeding may also occur as a natural response to an injury and cannot always be prevented. Cause death is an extreme outcome that is not typically associated with most injuries.
The sentence suggests that Van Gogh was worried about something related to the appearance of his painting. The phrase "appeared different" implies that the painting did not look the way he wanted it to. The option "new look" best fits this context as it suggests a change in appearance. The other options, such as "chickens" and "slashes" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for who it is important to pay attention to when attending school. Teachers are an obvious answer because they are the ones who are responsible for teaching and imparting knowledge to students. Paying attention to teachers is critical for students to learn effectively and succeed in their academic pursuits. The other options, such as falling down, time, stupidity, and patience, are not relevant to the context of the question or the purpose of attending school.
The fugu blowfish is a type of fish that is generally found in the waters around Japan, particularly in the Sea of Japan. This fish is known for its toxic flesh, which can be deadly if not prepared properly, and is a delicacy in Japan. The other options, such as the Atlantic Ocean, fish market, or rock band, are clearly not related to the habitat of the fugu blowfish.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to have a certain level of competence to receive government benefits while they are on disability. Competence refers to the ability to perform certain tasks or duties, or to possess certain skills, which may factor into eligibility for disability benefits. Qualification also suggests a similar idea, but competence is a more appropriate term in this context. Potence and information have no logical connection to the sentence.
The use of the word "nose" suggests that the context is related to an aircraft, as the nose of an aircraft refers to the front part of the plane. The phrase "alarms went off" indicates that something went wrong, possibly with the aircraft's altitude or speed, which may trigger alarms in the cockpit. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the steak house is known for serving a particular side dish that originated from a specific state. The correct answer is likely to be a state that is known for its corn production. Nebraska, in particular, is known as the Cornhusker State and is one of the leading corn-producing states in the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shark is unhappy in its current environment, which is likely a man-made tank. It implies that the shark wants to be in a more natural, open environment. The choices "sea world" and "great oceans" could both potentially fit, but "tropical waters" is a more specific and accurate answer, as many sharks are known to prefer warmer waters. "Tamales Bay" and "the key" do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the car is able to hunt in the dark, which implies that it has some ability to see in low light conditions. The only answer option related to this ability is "see at night." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are simply opposite in meaning to what is being discussed.
The sentence suggests the bachelor stored the groceries in a place where they could be forgotten, which suggests a place in the home where he wouldn't see them often. The choice 'storage cabinet' makes the most sense, as it's a place where people commonly store non-perishables, such as canned goods and dried foods. The other options, like 'refrigerator' and 'car trunk', wouldn't make sense since the former is a place for perishables and the latter is an inconvenient place to store goods for everyday use.
The context suggests that people are scared and getting a gun as a response to that fear. The phrase "arm themselves" directly implies the act of acquiring a weapon for protection or defense. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and seem out of place.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to the experience of watching a film. The word "hoping" indicates that the person is looking for a particular outcome or emotional response. While insight may be a secondary goal for some viewers, the primary reason for watching a film is usually to be entertained. Fear and erection may be responses to certain types of films, but they are not universal goals for all viewers. Expectations may be a factor in choosing which film to watch, but they do not directly relate to the experience of watching the film itself.
The sentence implies that remembering a terrible event can have negative emotional consequences, which is commonly associated with the term "trauma." Trauma refers to a psychological response to a distressing event, such as a violent attack, natural disaster, or serious accident, that can cause long-lasting psychological distress. The other options do not reflect the negative emotional consequences of remembering a traumatic event.
The sentence mentions "intermission," which is a term typically used in reference to a break during a performance or event. The fact that hot dogs were selling fast suggests that they were being sold at a venue where people were gathering for an event, such as a sporting event. The other options, including park, Disneyland, apartment, and cows, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Flute is a musical instrument commonly used in orchestras and symphonies. While a park or music shop may have a flute player, it is less likely to specifically go there to watch someone play the flute. A musical instrument store may have flutes for sale but is not where one would go to watch a performance.
The sentence clearly states that Billy is going to sleep, which implies that he will not be awake for the next few hours. The other options may occur during sleep, but they do not accurately describe what Billy will be for the next few hours after he falls asleep. Snoring and sleepwalking are specific behaviors that may occur during sleep, but they do not describe the overall state of being asleep. Loss of consciousness and latency may refer to medical or psychological concepts related to sleep, but they do not accurately describe what Billy will be for the next few hours.
The question is asking about the location of an apple tree in the North, which suggests a colder climate. Alaska is the northernmost state in the United States and has a subarctic climate, which makes it a likely location for a tree that requires cold temperatures to thrive. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the old conservative people are not happy with the changes in society. Resentment is a feeling of anger or bitterness towards someone or something, often because of a perceived injustice. It fits best with the context of the sentence. Depression, hurt and anger may also be possible options, but they are less likely because they are not as directly related to the idea of resistance to change. Acceptance is unlikely as it implies the opposite of what is being described in the sentence.
The question is asking about the consequence of failing at something we attempt, implying that failure is a likely outcome. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequence of failing, and some options like "leave" and "get shunned" are not commonly associated with failure. "Trying" is not a consequence, but rather an action that leads to the possibility of either success or failure.
The sentence is suggesting that when someone goes into a deep trance and stops feeling attached to their body, they may experience a physical sensation. The word "tingling" is the only option that describes a physical sensation, which makes it the correct answer. The other options either refer to techniques used to enter a trance state (meditation, closed eyes) or negative side effects (loss of control, memory loss) that may occur during a trance.
Mammoths are extinct animals that lived during prehistoric times, which is a period of history that dates back millions of years ago. It is not associated with any particular era or artist like Marwell comics or museum of natural history. Forests may have existed during prehistoric times, but this option is too broad to be a correct answer to the question.
The question is asking for an alternative to a hamburger, which is typically a type of fast food made from ground beef. Among the choices, only pizza is also a popular fast food alternative to hamburgers. Sandwiches are too broad of a category and could include hamburgers, while a restaurant or fast food restaurant could serve hamburgers as well. The option "mouth" is clearly a nonsensical choice.
The sentence suggests that learning about science can cause a particular emotion. Smiles and feeling hot are not commonly associated with learning about science. Invent is a verb, not an emotion. Frustration might be a possible emotion, but the sentence uses the word "cause," which implies a positive emotion, and frustration is typically a negative emotion. Excitement is frequently associated with learning about science because it can inspire curiosity, wonder, and a sense of discovery.
A traffic artery is a term used to describe a major road or highway that connects different areas and carries a large volume of traffic. Therefore, it is more likely to be clogged due to the high number of vehicles using it. Major cities may have many traffic arteries, but not every road in a major city is a traffic artery. Towns usually do not have traffic arteries as they lack the volume of traffic to warrant such a description. Traffic lights may cause traffic congestion, but they are not traffic arteries themselves.
The sentence suggests that the person is facing a long winter commute and that the heater in some vehicle has stopped working. An automobile is a common mode of transportation for commuting, and it is likely that this is the vehicle that the writer is referring to. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the sick person may experience side effects if they do not receive treatment. "Throw up" is a common side effect of many illnesses and may be a sign of an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. "Get better" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as the sentence implies that the person is not getting better without treatment. "Train" and "battle cancer" are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and "take medicine" is the opposite of what is being suggested in the sentence- that the person is not receiving any treatment.
The sentence suggests that Mary has an injury that affects her appearance, and she believes that this injury makes her less beautiful. The word "misshapen" means that her injury has caused her body to be deformed or distorted in some way, which would explain why she believes she is not beautiful. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the child is waiting for something, which often leads to impatience. Wisdom, tiredness, and boredom are unlikely attitudes for a child waiting for something specific. Anxiety could be a possible answer, but it would depend on the situation and the child's personal disposition. However, impatience is commonly associated with waiting, especially among children who may lack the emotional maturity to handle delayed gratification.
After eating a meal, especially lunch, it is common to feel full due to the amount of food consumed. This is because the stomach expands to accommodate the food, and the brain receives signals that it's time to stop eating. The other options are not associated with the experience of eating lunch, and may not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the committee had a lot of responsibility and they were part of a fast-growing entity. Doughnut shops, churches, and office buildings may have committees, but they are not typically associated with rapid growth. The term "business" is commonly used to refer to an organization or company, and it is often associated with growth and expansion. Additionally, government is typically not referred to as a "fast-growing" entity, so it is not a likely choice.
The sentence suggests that the individual needs instruction to find information. Two options in the choices involve instruction: listening to online lessons and going to school. The other options (learn, ask questions, death) do not directly address the need for instruction.
The sentence implies that the double edged razor is commonly used for shaving purposes, as it is typically found in a shaving kit. While it is possible to use a razor to cut tape, this is not a common use for a shaving razor. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the real estate agent is known for being honest, and the question is referring to a behavior that the agent refused to do to a client. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a term that is synonymous with dishonesty or deception. "Lie" is the best answer because it means providing false or misleading information, which is a clear contradiction to the agent's reputation for honesty. The other options also suggest dishonesty, but they are not as direct as "lie." "Charming" is not related to the context of the question.
The question is asking for what listening is a "big part" of, suggesting that it is a significant aspect. Empathy involves being able to understand and share the feelings of others, often through active listening. Therefore, it is likely that listening is a big part of developing empathy. The other options may involve listening to some extent, but they are not the central aspect.
The sentence implies that the reason they only had a small dog is because their living conditions limited their ability to have a larger pet, such as in a small apartment where there may not be enough space for a bigger animal. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they imply more space or different types of living arrangements that are not mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence mentions winter and traveling up a mountain, which suggests that the person has a sport or activity that he enjoys during the winter season. Among the choices, skiing is the most common winter sport that is often done on a mountain. Playing volleyball, hockey, knitting, or skating do not require traveling up a mountain during winter.
The use of the phrase "when their engagement has ended" implies that the soldiers in question were engaged in some sort of military conflict. The choices "use weapons" and "follow orders" are both common activities for soldiers during a conflict, but do not necessarily relate to the end of their engagement. "Die in battle" is a grim option but does not address what happens when the soldiers' engagement has ended. "Hope" is too vague to be a correct answer. "Coming home" is the most logical choice as it suggests that the soldiers will be returning home once their engagement has ended.
The word "agreeing" suggests a sense of unity and agreement between people. "Harmony" refers to a pleasing combination of different elements or people that work well together, indicating a sense of agreement and unity between them. "Band together" suggests a sense of uniting for a common purpose, "smiles" suggest a positive emotion but not necessarily agreement, "rapport" refers to a sense of understanding and connection, and "belonging" refers to feeling accepted within a group.
The word "ignorance" implies a lack of knowledge or understanding about a particular subject. Therefore, the best course of action for someone suffering from ignorance would be to learn new information or seek out the truth about the subject. "Judge" and "judgement" do not make sense in this context, and "learn about subject" is redundant as it is already implied by "learn new" or "find truth."
The phrase "outside of a central Wisconsin town" suggests that the advertisement was physically placed somewhere near the town. "La ville" means "the town" in French, so this is likely the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the object being described has many eyes but cannot see, and that it has skin that can be peeled off. Only potatoes have "eyes" in the sense of small indentations on their surface from which new shoots can grow. Potatoes also have skin that can be peeled off, unlike faces or people's heads, which have flesh and bone structure, or lizards and mammals, which have scales or fur.
Wearable gold is typically sold in jewelry stores. Jewelry stores specialize in selling all types of jewelry, including pieces made of precious metals like gold. The other options do not make sense, as gold would not typically be sold in a church, treasure chest, zoo, or Fort Knox (which is a United States Bullion Depository).
The sentence implies that the question is asking about a common responsibility that many adults have. Out of the options given, work is the most likely answer as it is a necessary responsibility for many adults to maintain financial stability and support themselves or their families. The other options do not have the same level of universal applicability or necessity.
The context suggests that the title being referred to is related to one's personal identity or information. A safe deposit box may have a label stating the owner's information, but it would not take up a large percentage of the space. A magazine article may have a headline, but it would not cover the entire magazine. Indicating accomplishment may refer to a trophy or plaque, but again it would not take up a large percentage of the space. A library would have many books with titles, but individually they would not cover a large percentage of the space. Therefore, indicating identity is the most appropriate answer.
Board games are often stored on shelves or in cupboards as they are typically flat and can be easily stacked or stored in a compact manner. "Home" and "house" are too general and do not suggest a specific location within the home, while "basement" is too specific and not everyone has one.
The question is asking for a method to learn new material for a test. "Study" is the most relevant choice because it specifically refers to reviewing material in order to learn and remember it. The other choices, such as watching television or having fun, do not necessarily contribute to the process of learning new material. Going to school can be helpful, but it is not specific enough to be the best answer. Finally, while asking questions can be a useful study technique, it is not always applicable or necessary depending on the subject matter.
The key phrase in the sentence is "Mary was in motion the whole time," which suggests that everyone else was not moving as much as Mary. The word "standing" also implies a lack of movement, so "standing still" is the most appropriate choice. The other options ("stopped," "stillness," "static," "being still") are either redundant or do not convey the sense of relative movement that is implied in the sentence.
The fact that the fox was caught by animal control implies that it was removed from an urban or suburban area, where it may have been causing problems or could be in danger. The options "english hunt," "burrow," and "woods" all suggest confined spaces where the fox would not have been released, while "mountains" may not be a suitable habitat for the animal. "Rural area" is a more general and appropriate option that could be suitable for the release of a wild animal into its natural environment.
The question is asking about the amount of water, and suggests that there is currently only a small amount of water present. The phrase "not a little amount" implies that there is actually a significant amount of water, so the correct answer would be an option that indicates a large quantity. "Big" and "large" both suggest a substantial size or amount, but "lot of" specifically refers to a large quantity of something, making it the most appropriate choice. "Bog" and "rain" do not necessarily indicate a large amount of water, so they can be eliminated as options.
"Petrol" is a term commonly used in British English to refer to gasoline or fuel for vehicles. In this context, the most likely place to get petrol would be a gas station, as that is where vehicles typically go to refuel. The other options, such as "burn hot" and "fuel tank," are not locations where petrol can be obtained. "Car" is also not a suitable option as it is a vehicle that requires petrol to run, not a place to obtain it.
The question specifies that the person is standing in a coastal, eastern seaboard state. Based on the choices provided, South Carolina is the only state that fits this description. Mountains, Arkansas, Louisiana, and California are not located on the eastern seaboard.
The phrase "going for a run" typically refers to engaging in aerobic exercise, which is commonly referred to as "working out." The other options are not related to this context - a trip suggests traveling, running in could have multiple meanings and falling down implies an accident or injury.
The question implies that the answer can be found in the context of one's own home, which rules out options like park or Switzerland which are physical locations. The word "see" suggests that the answer may have to do with visual perception, and "mountain" is a physical object. Therefore, the option "picture" is the most likely answer, as one can see a mountain in a picture or photograph displayed in their home. The other options again do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question asks about a sport that involves hurdles, indicating that it requires someone to run and jump over obstacles. The option "running" fits this description, as hurdle racing involves running and jumping over hurdles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, and therefore can be ruled out as incorrect answers.
The word "clever" suggests that the answer is not straightforward or obvious. "Clumsy" implies physical awkwardness rather than lack of skill, "dull" implies boring rather than bad, "stupid" and "dummy" imply a lack of intelligence rather than lack of skill. "Ineffectual," on the other hand, suggests that someone is not getting the job done or achieving their goals, which could imply a lack of skill.
The sentence suggests that Joe learned some exercises to help him relax from his therapist, and that these exercises all had a common focus. The phrase "centered around" implies that there was a central theme or action that the exercises all revolved around. Out of the five choices, deep breathing is most closely related to relaxation and is often promoted as a relaxation technique. The other options do not have a strong connection to relaxation or the context of the sentence.
Birthdays are commonly associated with gift-giving. This is a time-honored tradition that has been practiced for many centuries, and is still popular today. The other options do not reflect the typical activities associated with birthdays.
The word "unexpected" suggests that the person will experience a feeling of surprise when confronted with something they did not anticipate. The other options may not be necessarily related to the context of being confronted with something unexpected. Anxiety may be a possible response, but not all people react this way. Dedication, solutions, and acknowledgment do not necessarily apply to the situation of being confronted with something unexpected.
The word "lead" suggests that the question is referring to the chemical element. Lead is known to be toxic and harmful to human health when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Too much exposure to lead can cause a range of health problems, including brain damage, nervous system disorders, and anemia. The other options, such as "very heavy" or "very dense" describe physical properties of lead, but do not address its effects on human health.
The sentence states that James was in shock upon learning something, and the word "not" in the question indicates that it was the opposite of what he expected. Therefore, the correct answer is "expected." The other answer choices do not provide any context clues or logical connections to the sentence.
The question is asking for advice on what to practice when going to Spain. Since Spain is a Spanish-speaking country, it makes sense to prioritize practicing speaking the language. The other options (stand upright, courtesy, further education, cross street) could also be important to keep in mind when traveling, but are not as crucial to being able to communicate and navigate effectively.
The sentence mentions that the person met the speaker in the lobby of the office and that they didn't have much in common, suggesting that they may not have engaged in an extended conversation or activity. Therefore, the most common interaction between two people who have just met is to shake hands. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence provides information about the location of the church, which is near a store. It suggests that the church is likely to be located in a commercial area, such as a street corner, where there are other businesses and stores nearby. The other options do not fit with the description of a church that is located near a store.
The sentence suggests that sleeping well has a positive effect on the body and mind. One of the primary benefits of sleeping well is relaxation, as the body is able to rest and rejuvenate during the sleep cycle. Sweating and nightmares are not necessarily indicative of good sleep, and while dreaming can occur during sleep, it is not the primary result of sleeping well. "Have fun" is also an unlikely outcome of a good night's sleep.
The sentence implies that the person mentioned is required to attend school, which is a common characteristic of someone who is a student. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Register" might be a possible answer if the sentence had mentioned the teen needing to register for classes, but that is not the case here. "Old enough" and "put on shoes" are also not relevant to the sentence. "Grouchy" is a possible descriptor of the teen's mood, but it does not answer the question of what the teen is.
People often compete in sports in order to achieve a sense of accomplishment, whether it be personal or within a team. Winning can bring a sense of pride and satisfaction, and the feeling of achieving something difficult can be motivating. Injuries are a risk associated with sports, but they are not usually a reason people choose to compete. Enemies and rivalry may be present in some sports, but they are not the primary motivation for most athletes. Death is not a motivation for sports, as it is not an expected outcome of competition.
The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys creating art more than having sex, which implies that creating art gives her a feeling of pleasure. Painting can be a form of self-expression and a way to escape from the stresses of everyday life, which may explain why Sally finds it so enjoyable. The other options do not align with the positive connotation of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a potential danger associated with cleaning on the 10th floor of an unfinished building. It is important to take precautions and be aware of potential hazards when working at heights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Since the question mentions that the foot is already covered in cloth, it suggests that the person is wearing some kind of footwear. Out of the options provided, only "shoe" is a type of footwear. It is common to put a cloth-covered foot into a shoe rather than on the ground, desk or table. "Sock" is also a type of footwear, but it is worn underneath a shoe, so it is not the correct answer.
The statement suggests that the person being described is a successful marathon runner, which requires a great deal of physical endurance and stamina. Therefore, after running for such a long distance, it's natural to assume that the person might experience some physical discomfort. However, the use of the phrase "wasn't even beginning to" implies that the person is still feeling relatively good, and not yet facing any major physical symptoms. The other options, such as vomiting, excruciating pain, or death, all suggest much more severe consequences of running a marathon and are less likely to be seen as a natural part of the process.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a contraceptive device called a diaphragm, which can be purchased from a drugstore. A diaphragm is a type of birth control that is inserted into the vagina, so none of the other options make sense in this context. A valve is a mechanical device used to regulate the flow of fluids or gases, while a human organ and a person's chest are not relevant to the conversation.
The question asks for a reason to keep going to work, which implies a positive outcome or motivation. "Promotions" is the most logical choice, as it suggests that there is potential for career advancement and increased job responsibilities. "Stress," "bad mood," and "exhaustion" are all negative factors that could make someone want to quit their job, while "for a party" is an irrelevant and nonsensical option.
Bar service is typically a key feature of weddings, where guests often gather to toast the newlyweds and enjoy a celebratory atmosphere. Entertainment venues such as nightclubs and concert halls may also offer bar service, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Hotel bars and train bars may be important amenities for travelers, but this is not necessarily related to celebrations. Pool parties often involve alcohol and socializing, but they are generally more casual and less formal than weddings.
The sentence suggests that Sarah had a characteristic that hindered her socialization, which is commonly associated with being dull or uninteresting. The other options don't have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a location where food can be kept cold, which suggests that the correct answer will be a type of storage container or area that is designed to keep food at a lower temperature. The options "cupboard," "oven," "glass," and "table" do not fit this description, but the option "fridge" does. A fridge (short for refrigerator) is a common household appliance that is designed to keep food at a low temperature to slow down the growth of bacteria and keep food fresh longer.
The sentence suggests that the penny is not in a contained space, such as a piggy bank or coin purse, but rather in an open or unsecured location. Additionally, the phrase "beside your shoe" implies that the penny is located on the ground. Therefore, the correct answer is ground. The other options are containers or surfaces where one would typically store or place money.
Lighting a fire is commonly done to generate heat and warmth, particularly in colder environments. This can help to make a room more comfortable and pleasant to be in, especially during the winter. The other choices do not necessarily have a clear link to the idea of intentionally lighting a fire. For example, burning down a house would be an act of arson rather than a practical reason for lighting a fire. Helping people or cleansing could potentially involve fire in some cultural or symbolic contexts, but these are less common or specific reasons than warming a room.
The sentence provides context clues that suggest that Simon placed drawings on a wall in a setting related to education. The term "crayon pictures" implies that these were drawn by a child, which would make a school or classroom a likely location. The other options are not connected to education in any obvious way and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a word that a bad person is unlikely to be called. "Virtuous" is a word that describes someone who has high moral standards and behaves in an honorable way, which is the opposite of what a "bad" person would be expected to do. The other words do not necessarily describe behavior or character traits and are not antonyms of "bad."
A window is a type of opening in a wall that allows light and air into a building. It is commonly found in houses and buildings, particularly on walls that face outside. The other options such as front door, space shuttle, office, and car are not typically associated with windows in the same way as walls in a house.
The sentence suggests that playing games can sometimes become more serious, which implies that there is a competition or challenge involved. Competitiveness is a common reason why games become more serious, as players may be vying for a prize or simply trying to outdo each other. The other options do not explain why games would take on a serious tone.
The sentence suggests that the woman chose to watch TV instead of going to the gym for physical exercise. This puts her at risk of gaining weight or becoming less fit, which is why "get fat" is the correct answer. The other options may be indirectly related to the situation, but they don't address the immediate risk the woman is facing.
The question is asking for the primary reason for visiting a shop, which would likely be to purchase something. While spending money may be necessary to make a purchase, it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop. Spending too much is not a reason for visiting a shop, but rather a potential consequence. Selling items is the purpose of the shop, not the reason for visiting it. Comparing prices may be a step in the purchasing process, but it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop.
Wooden chairs are commonly used in living rooms as they add a touch of warmth and elegance to the décor of the space. In contrast, office spaces tend to have more modern furniture, desks are usually used with office chairs or task chairs, and cubicles are typically furnished with basic chairs with minimal styling. While a wooden chair may work well in a home office or even a covered outdoor space like a porch, it is not typically a go-to choice for a work environment.
The sentence suggests that businesses that provide assistance to those in need are doing so in a positive and charitable manner. "Good will" refers to the beneficial or favorable attitude or relationship between individuals, businesses, or groups, and is often associated with acts of kindness or generosity. The other options, such as fear and dependence, have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that meeting people with similar attitudes can lead to a positive outcome. People with similar attitudes often share common interests and values, which can lead to a natural connection and potential for friendship. Anxiety and being bored are negative outcomes that do not fit with the context of the sentence. Love and a new job are possibilities, but are not as directly related to meeting people with similar attitudes as making new friends.
The sentence suggests that children engage in a particular activity at home that can be described as addictive. Out of the given choices, watching television is often associated with addictive behavior due to its immersive nature and the availability of countless programs and channels to choose from. The other options, such as drawing or playing chess, are not typically associated with addictions, while playing basketball or listening to music are more active and may not have the same addictive qualities as watching television.
The context of the sentence suggests that the item being purchased is a musical instrument, specifically a mandolin. It also mentions a storage box, which is a common accessory for musical instruments. Therefore, the most logical choice is a music store, which specializes in selling musical instruments and accessories. The other choices, such as Spain or a grocery store, do not have any clear connection to the context or purpose of the purchase. The option "Instrument case" could be a possible choice, but it does not mention anything about the purchase of the mandolin itself.
The sentence suggests that Bailey was skilled in his job as a real estate agent, which likely involved convincing people to buy or sell properties. Persuasion is a key component of salesmanship, and a good real estate agent would be adept at making convincing arguments and presenting information in a compelling way. The other options, like deceive and manipulate, carry negative connotations and would not be desirable traits in a successful real estate agent.
The phrase "green with envy" is a common saying that indicates extreme jealousy, often used to describe someone who covets something they cannot have. The use of the phrase "green with envy" suggests that his eyes appeared green because of the intensity of his jealousy. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the common expression.
The word "foreign" suggests that the flight in question is leaving the country. Domestic flights are flights that only operate within the borders of a particular country, so they cannot take you outside that country. All the other options (imaginary flight, American, native, and indigenous) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a school is a necessary part of a community. This is because schools provide education and learning opportunities for children and young people who live in that community. The other options may have schools, but the sentence doesn't imply that having a school is necessary for those places to function as they do. For example, playgrounds are important for communities, but not essential for their existence.
The sentence suggests that there is a state north of Kansas where cows outnumber people 4 to 1. The option "nebraska" is the only state that is directly mentioned as being north of Kansas. The other options ("advertisement," "countryside," "fairy tale," and "iowa") do not provide any useful information for determining the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the organization is providing support or aid to families who are experiencing some kind of difficulty or challenge, which is commonly referred to as hardship. The other options - risk taking, doom, helping others, and helpfulness - do not relate to the concept of families needing assistance or support.
The question suggests that the context is about communication, and the use of "talking to" implies that the goal is to convey a message to someone or something. In order for the message to be effective, the speaker would likely hope that they are being heard by the listener. The other options do not relate to effective communication or conveying a message.
The sentence refers to the aftermath of getting a divorce, which typically results in the dissolution of the marriage and the end of the relationship between the spouses. Therefore, the correct answer is "no spouse." The other options, such as "lot of grief" or "children suffer," may be common experiences associated with divorce, but they do not address the specific question of what happens to someone after the divorce is finalized. "Freedom" may be a possible choice, but it lacks the specificity and certainty of "no spouse." "Party time" is unlikely to be a correct answer as it is not a natural consequence of divorce, but rather a personal choice.
The sentence suggests that exercise is not a common habit for some people, specifically those who are described as "just plain" something. The word "lazy" is commonly used to describe people who don't like to put effort into physical activities, including exercise. The other options, such as "sloth" and "couch potato," are also associated with a lack of physical activity, but they are not as commonly used in everyday language as "lazy." "Condition heart" and "work out" are both related to exercise, but they do not fit the context of the sentence, which is discussing people who do not like to exercise.
The phrase "very strong leader" is often associated with contexts that require strict discipline and command, such as military or army contexts. A strong leader is needed to maintain order and control in high-pressure environments, and the other options do not have any clear connection to this type of leadership.
The question is asking for a habit that can cause lung cancer, which is well known to be a serious health risk associated with smoking cigarettes. The other answer choices are unrelated to lung cancer and are not typically associated with harmful health effects.
The sentence states that the person volunteered to help after a disaster, suggesting that they wanted to provide assistance to those affected. The phrase "able-bodied" further supports this idea, as it implies that the person was physically capable of providing help. The option "of service to" best captures this intention, while the other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Critiqued" and "ask questions" imply a different motive than providing help, while "make happy" does not address the issue of disaster relief, and "have compassion for" suggests a more passive response.
The sentence implies that the salesman's job performance is being evaluated and that there are consequences for not doing the job correctly. The most severe consequence mentioned in the choices is getting fired, which is a common consequence for poor job performance. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence or are not consequences of poor job performance.
The context of the sentence suggests that the storm is relevant to a specific location, which is likely where John was planning to go. The options "tropical seas" and "tropics" are too general and could refer to many places, while "Cuba" is a specific country and may not necessarily be where John was headed. "Caribbean" is a region that is often associated with tropical storms and would be a logical location for John to delay his trip to given the meteorologist's warning. "Weather report" is not a location and does not relate directly to John's travel plans.
The option "pleasure" is the most likely correct answer because smoking is often associated with feelings of relaxation and enjoyment due to the nicotine content in cigarettes. The other options, such as "death" and "lung disease," are negative consequences of smoking and are generally not reasons why someone would continue to smoke. Additionally, the option "smell" might be a personal preference for some people, but it is not a common reason for smoking.
The word "interesting" suggests that the question is about meeting new people who are engaging or fascinating in some way. One common way to do this is by socializing, which typically involves attending events, joining clubs/groups or engaging in conversations with people. Online dating might also help meet people, but the focus is usually more on finding a romantic partner rather than just making connections. Exploring or saying hello to people can also lead to meeting new people, but it is less likely to result in long-lasting social connections. Being friendly is important, but it's not an action that leads directly to meeting people.
The word "manual" suggests a book or reference guide that provides information on various subjects. This may be the best option for Sam if he is looking for detailed and comprehensive information on obscure subjects. "Online" and "Google" may provide some information but may not be reliable or accurate sources. "Newspaper" is unlikely to have information on obscure subjects, and "outside" is not a logical option for finding information.
The sentence suggests that although clear blue skies are nice, there isn't much to see up there if it isn't a little something else. This implies that a little bit of clouds in the sky would make the view more interesting. Therefore, the correct answer is "cloudy." The other options are all negative descriptors and do not fit with the positive tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy liked something that could be added to a meal, but he chose not to add it because he was watching his weight. The fact that he used a low fat version of it also implies that it is a food item that typically contains fat. Salad dressing is a common food item that is often high in fat, but can also be found in low fat versions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the place being referred to is a densely populated area with a large number of people living in it. This narrows down the options to "city" and "construction site," but the latter is not necessarily associated with a large number of people living in it. The mention of an excavation suggests that the place is a site where archaeological or construction work is being undertaken. Egypt is a specific country and the desert is not necessarily associated with a large population. Therefore, "city" is the best answer.
The sentence implies that the speaker is asking about the proper disposal of garbage, which is typically done in a trashcan or garbage bin. Toronto is a city and not relevant to the question, nor is floor, television, or in your neighbor's yard.
A valid contract typically requires the signatures of all parties involved to indicate their agreement and acceptance of the terms. Revising and rejecting refer to the process of negotiating the terms and conditions of the contract before it is signed. Written in blood is not a legal requirement for a contract to be valid, and written on paper is another necessary component as it provides a written record of the agreement.
The sentence states that the couple were strict when it came to sex and were going to do something related to their wedding. The phrase "wait for" suggests that they were going to abstain from sex until their wedding night. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A train station is a place where people embark and disembark from trains at scheduled times. Knowing the time is essential for planning the arrival and departure times of trains, and a clock would be helpful for keeping track of these schedules. The other options, such as a desk or a school room, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence that involves tracking arrival times.
The sentence suggests that competing is a way for some people to release aggression. Competing often involves a sense of challenge and confrontation, which can be a healthy outlet for aggression when done in a safe and controlled way. The other options do not seem to fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people who always hold a remote are not likely to possess a certain trait. The options "attached," "lovable," and "close" refer to emotional connections, and there is no clear connection to remotes. The option "likely" doesn't make sense grammatically. Therefore, the best answer is "companionable," which suggests that those who always hold a remote may not be easy to spend time with because they are focused on their electronic device rather than engaging with those around them.
issing is often associated with physical pleasure, especially in the context of a romantic relationship. Hormones may also play a role in someone's desire to kiss, but the question is specifically asking about how they feel about it. Shyness and happiness are emotions that may be present in a new relationship, but they don't necessarily relate specifically to kissing. "Like" is too vague to determine whether it refers to the feeling of enjoyment or something else entirely.
National parks are often known for their preserved natural sites, including forests. Forests can be found in many places, such as the countryside or the Amazon basin, but the question specifically mentions Billy wanting to see a forest, so the answer that directly relates to forests and their preservation is the national park option. The temperate zone does not provide enough context to know if a forest would be present in that area.
The sentence suggests that James is unable to use his stove, so he needs to find an alternative location to cook. The most logical answer is the one that provides an alternative cooking location, which is a friend's house. The other options either don't have a kitchen or don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
Ice is known for its ability to lower the temperature of anything it touches, which would cause the skin to feel cold. The other options do not make sense in this context - ice on skin would not cause excitement, itching, electric feelings, or pressure.
The sentence implies that animals are natural and unencumbered by self-consciousness, which means they behave authentically and without restraint. An animal's primary activity is its biological imperative to survive, which requires it to live a life in accordance with its instincts. The other choices, such as listening, biting, fighting, or smiling, do not accurately capture the essence of how animals behave in the wild.
The question states that the condition sets in after going to work with too little sleep. This suggests that the condition is related to being tired, which is a characteristic of exhaustion. Anger and bad mood may be related to exhaustion, but the question specifically mentions going to work, so poor judgement and boredom are less likely to be related to the context.
The phrase "sex in a happy relationship" suggests an intimate and emotional connection between the individuals involved, which is often associated with the term "making love." The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional and relational aspects of sex in a happy relationship. "Nice act" and "wonderful thing" are vague and could refer to any positive experience, while "last hour" is unrelated to the topic and "feel good" is too general.
Intoxication refers to the state of being drunk, which is a common side effect of consuming too much alcohol. Vomiting and nausea may occur as the body tries to rid itself of the excess alcohol, but defecation and frequent urination are not typically associated with excessive alcohol consumption.
The sentence mentions the bald eagle as a protected species, which suggests that something has threatened their survival. The word "dwindling" indicates that the thing that threatened the bald eagle's survival was decreasing in number or quantity. The phrase "natural habitat" refers to the environment where a species naturally lives and thrives, so it makes sense that protecting this would help preserve the bald eagle population. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence suggests that there are many fast food restaurants located close to each other in order to handle a high volume of foot traffic. This is a common characteristic of densely-populated urban areas, like big cities, where there are many people moving around and in need of convenient food options. The other options, like farms or the center of town, do not fit this context as well.
The sentence states that there is no source of light entering the structure. Houses and office buildings generally have windows or other openings to let in natural light, so they can be eliminated as options. A roof and a glass box are not likely to be structures that people spend time in, so they can also be eliminated. A windowless room is the most likely choice for a structure with no access to natural light.
Jellyfish are aquatic animals that live in the ocean. The sentence suggests that a jellyfish might get cold in a certain location, so the answer should be an ocean where the water temperature could drop. The Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean are two of the world's largest oceans and have a wide range of water temperatures depending on location, so they are the most likely options. Salt water and hypermarket/store are not relevant options for where a jellyfish could get cold.
Plants need sunlight to undergo photosynthesis, which is the process by which they produce energy to grow. Since an apple tree is a plant, it also requires sunlight to grow. The other answer options, such as apple juice and new hampshire, do not relate to the growth of an apple tree in any way. Bloom may refer to the flowering stage of the tree, but it is not the cause of its growth. Park may be a location where an apple tree is growing, but it does not explain what causes it to grow.
Anemones are usually found in tide pools or shallow water near the coast. The sentence mentions that the anemone was being harvested for sale in New York, which is a coastal state. Therefore, it is likely that the anemone was taken from a nearby tide pool rather than from a nursery or Michigan. The other options, such as the ocean floor or Atlantic Ocean, are too general and not specific enough to pinpoint the source of the anemone.
The sentence suggests that the computer user was completely lost and struggling to understand what he was doing, which would likely make the instructional course a difficult and frustrating experience for him. The phrase "pure hell" is a common idiom used to describe a situation that is extremely unpleasant or difficult. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that pouring water on oneself would result in something that is typically associated with water, such as becoming wet. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Thin blood and room temperature are unlikely to be affected by pouring water on oneself, while starting to melt and springing forth do not make sense in the context of human biology.
The sentence suggests that the baby birds fell out of their nest, and the mom bird responded in some way. However, the options "grieve," "molt," "poop," and "puff" do not seem to fit the context. The only option that makes sense is "sky," which suggests that the mom bird flew away or soared overhead. This would likely be a natural response if the mom bird was unable to retrieve the fallen babies, or if she wanted to assess the situation from a safe distance.
The context of the sentence mentions "Friday night," which is typically associated with high school football games. University and college campus may also have football fields, but they usually have games on Saturdays, not Fridays. City and excrete have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the man recognized his picture in the crossword section suggests that he was looking at a publication. The other options, such as a table or biology book, do not make sense in this context. Additionally, newspapers commonly feature sections such as crosswords and have photographs of people.
Tickets are commonly used to gain access to events or places, such as movies or sports games. The other options, such as a person's hand or a shoe, do not make sense in the context of the question.
Sugar is commonly used in cooking and baking, which typically takes place in a kitchen. Cupboards and containers are common storage places for pantry items like sugar within a kitchen, while a bedroom or neighbor's house would be unlikely locations for storing sugar.
The context suggests that the word "highlight" refers to a type of marker. Therefore, the most likely option to obtain one would be a marker store. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The context suggests that the artist is not actively creating art, but is waiting for something to happen to spark their creativity. The word "dreaming" implies that the artist is imagining and contemplating rather than actively engaging in their work. The options "car accident" and "nightmares" are negative and have no clear connection to the context. "Wake up" is also unrelated as it suggests the artist needs to snap out of something, while the sentence describes a longer-term issue. "Hallucination" is not likely to be the answer as it suggests an altered state of reality rather than a burst of creativity. Only "inspiration" fits the context as it is a common trigger for artists to start working on a project.
Inflation is an economic concept where the general price level of goods and services increases over time. One way governments can combat inflation is by raising interest rates, which makes borrowing money more expensive and encourages people to save their money instead of spending it. This decrease in demand for goods and services can help stabilize prices and reduce inflationary pressures. The other options, such as dissatisfaction or not doing much, do not have a direct relation to inflation. Saving money and investing may be good personal financial strategies, but they are not necessarily effective ways to combat inflation on a larger scale.
The sentence suggests that the driver did not stop after hitting a post, which implies that the driver left the scene quickly. The phrase "rush away" best matches this description. The other options do not reflect the action of leaving the scene of an accident.
The context of the sentence suggests that the show was about human behavior, which would require acting. However, the sentence implies that none of them could act well, which adds an ironic twist to the situation. The other options, such as questioning authority or melting, do not seem to fit the context of putting on a show about human beings.
The question implies that killing people is not a normal behavior for most people, and therefore may have negative psychological effects. It is commonly accepted that killing someone will induce feelings of guilt and remorse, as taking another person's life is a serious act that goes against societal norms and moral values. The other options are consequences of committing murder, such as legal punishment, but do not address the psychological effects on a person.
The sentence suggests that the substance being described changes from a solid to a liquid state. When a substance melts, it becomes fluid, which means it has the ability to flow and change shape. The other options do not fit the description of a substance that changes from a solid to a liquid state. Hollowness, openness, weakness, and instability are all related to a substance's strength or structural integrity, which is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The term "anemone" is not specific to any one subject or field of study. Therefore, looking up its definition in a dictionary would be the best choice. The other options do not provide the definition of what an anemone is. Oceanography may include information about anemones, but it would not specifically define the term. Tide pool and sea water may contain anemones, but they are not reliable sources for definitions. South Pacific is a region and is not relevant to the question.
The presence of shattered glass, blood, and a gun suggests that a crime has been committed. As a detective, it is their duty to secure the crime scene and prevent tampering or contamination of evidence. Therefore, the correct answer would be to tape off the perimeter of the crime scene. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The contrasting language in the sentence ("gentle" versus "different story") suggests that there is a difference in the treatment of the hand when washing with water versus when using chemicals. The adjectives "harsh" and "rough" both describe something that is tough and abrasive, which would make sense for how chemicals might feel on the skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is holding a lamp and is tired of doing so, indicating that they are likely looking for a surface on which to place it. The word "place" also implies that the speaker is talking about finding a stationary location for the lamp. Out of the given options, only "table" is a surface on which one might place a lamp, while the others do not make sense in the given context.
Excessive heat is not related to apples, sterilization, killing bacteria, or blue metal. These options are irrelevant to the question. Thin ice, on the other hand, can cause a person to slip and fall, which could be exacerbated by high temperature causing dehydration or exhaustion. Therefore, thin ice is the most likely answer that relates to the context of the question.
Sweating is a natural way for the body to regulate temperature during exercise. As the body heats up, sweat glands activate and release sweat onto the skin's surface, which then evaporates and cools the body down. The other options, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and exhaustion, may also occur during exercise, but they are not directly related to the body's response to heat.
The sentence suggests that the baker received a new supply of sugar and stored it somewhere. A container is the most logical choice for storing sugar in a bakery as it helps to keep it fresh and prevent it from spilling. The other options, such as the neighbor's house or coffee, are unrelated to the context of the sentence. The kitchen and pancake mix are both relevant to baking but are not specifically related to the storage of sugar.
The sentence suggests that a ferret's growling behavior is linked with a particular emotional state. Ferrets are known to growl when they feel threatened, scared, or angry, which are all associated with being in a bad mood. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a penalty box, which is a term commonly associated with hockey. Additionally, the referee calling a foul and a player being sent to the penalty box are both actions that are typical in a hockey game. The other options either do not have a penalty box or do not involve physical contact where a player can be called for a foul.
The sentence suggests that the A.I. has the ability to pick out separate entities within a larger group, implying that it can identify individual people within a densely packed crowd. The term "individual" specifically refers to a discrete unit that can be distinguished from others, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options describe a larger group or a less precise focus than what the sentence is suggesting.
Mountain marmots are a species of ground squirrels that are found in the high-elevation rocky areas of Colorado, as well as nearby states in the western region of the United States. The other options may be too broad or not specific enough to be the correct answer in this context. For example, while mountain marmots do live in the wild, this is not a specific enough location to choose from the list of options.
Losing in a competition can be frustrating for many people, as it often means that they did not achieve the desired outcome or reach their goals. The question suggests that competing against someone likely to cause this feeling. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that Giovanni has a wine cellar like many of his compatriots, which suggests that he is from a country or region that has a tradition of wine making and storing. Italy is well-known for its wine making culture and it is likely that Giovanni is living in Italy if he has a wine cellar. The other options do not provide any context about wine making or storage.
The sentence warns the reader to pay attention to the small print when something is offered for free, suggesting that there may be hidden costs or conditions associated with the offer. The word "costly" is a logical choice to describe the potential outcome if someone does not pay attention to the small print. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The presence of a great lake suggests that the location is likely near one of the Great Lakes in North America. Michigan is a state known for bordering four of the Great Lakes, making it a likely answer. The other options do not provide any indication of being near a great lake, making them less likely answers.
Live entertainment typically refers to performances that are experienced in-person, such as music concerts, plays, and comedy shows. Movie theaters primarily show movies, while parks and friend's houses are not commonly associated with live entertainment. The option "show" may seem plausible, but it is too broad to accurately pinpoint a specific location to see live entertainment. Therefore, the correct answer is the theatre, as it is a well-known venue for live performances.
The question is asking for the opposite of "hard," which suggests that the test is not difficult. The option that best fits this context is "easy." The other options (tricky, bearable, and tryhard) do not necessarily imply that the test is not hard, while "agreeable" is more commonly used to describe a pleasant personality rather than a test difficulty.
The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to keeping a finger warm. While a ring can keep a finger warm in some cases, it is not generally associated with warmth. Cake batter to taste add weight to scale and nose are not logical options. Hand is a possibility, but the specificity of the question ("where") suggests a more narrowly defined answer - a glove. A glove is an item designed specifically to keep hands (including fingers) warm, making it the most likely answer.
A larger shopping mall is likely to be located in the suburbs because these areas typically have more land available for the construction of large commercial buildings such as shopping malls. Additionally, suburban areas tend to have higher population densities and more disposable income, which makes them attractive locations for businesses to set up shop. Downtown areas may have smaller shopping areas, but they are generally more focused on businesses such as offices, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Indiana and out of town do not provide any information about where a shopping mall is likely to be located.
A student is likely to keep their notebook in their backpack, which is typically used to carry school supplies and books. The other options are less likely because a bookstore is a place where students buy books rather than keep them, a pocket may not be able to hold a notebook, an office is not typically associated with student possessions, and a classroom may be where the notebook is used but not where it is kept.
Fresh eggs are known to have a thick membrane surrounding the egg white and yolk, which helps to protect the contents of the egg inside. Cell membranes do exist, but they are not commonly referred to as "thick" membranes. Animal and filtration do not necessarily have thick membranes associated with them. Separating fluids may be accomplished through the use of a membrane, but this choice does not provide enough context for a definitive answer.
The sentence suggests that Lucy is likely to be found in a place where she regularly plays handball. Handball is typically played in an outdoor playground or indoor gymnasium setting, which makes options like field and street less likely. Bearing is not a location and does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is playground.
The sentence indicates that there is a potential danger involved in combining alcohol with movement on stairs. The phrase "falling down" suggests a loss of balance and a dangerous situation, which is the most likely outcome in this scenario. The other options, such as "lower standards" and "slurred speech," do not connect to the potential danger of using stairs while drunk. "Death" is a possibility, but it is an extreme and unlikely outcome compared to the more immediate danger of falling down.
The word "slippery" suggests that the object is difficult to hold onto, and may slip out of one's grasp. Therefore, the most likely thing to happen is that the person would drop the object. The other options (make music, bluegrass music, folk, discovery) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the footprints are caused by dirt being left behind, which is a common occurrence on surfaces like rugs that are often walked on. The other options, like roofs and floorboards, do not typically accumulate dirt in the same way that rugs do. Ground and surface of earth could be options, but the phrasing of "footprints that happen due to dirt being left behind inside" suggests the footprints are on an indoor surface.
The context of the question implies that the answer should relate to a common experience when shopping in a busy store. The phrase "packed store" suggests that there are many people there, which often leads to long lines or waiting times to pay for items. Therefore, the correct answer is standing in line, which is a common activity when shopping in crowded stores. The other options, such as singing out loud, tiredness, debt, and spending money, do not make sense in the context of shopping in a busy store.
The question implies that the location has a desk drawer and people of vastly different ages nearby. A school is a logical answer because it is a place where desks are commonly used, and students of different ages attend. In a school, a desk drawer may contain supplies or personal items belonging to a student or teacher, and the age range of individuals in a school setting can vary greatly, from young children to adult teachers. The other options do not align with the context provided in the question.
The sentence implies that the interior designer is looking for ways to improve the office's appearance, and one of the things she tried was adding a colorful rug under the computer. This suggests that the item being referred to is a piece of furniture that can accommodate a computer, which is most likely a desk. The other options, such as sofa or bedroom, do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a way to avoid problems when going somewhere, and the correct answer should be a step or action that can help achieve this. "Plan ahead" is the best option, as it implies taking time to organize and prepare for the journey, which can prevent potential issues such as getting lost or running into traffic. The other options may contain helpful information or actions, such as "know where to go," but they do not address the idea of avoiding problems specifically.
The sentence suggests that John ran very quickly or with great speed, as indicated by the phrase "ran very fast." The use of the word "feet" suggests that the question is asking about the manner in which John's feet touched the ground while he was running. The use of the word "lightly" suggests that John's feet did not hit the ground with much force, which is a common characteristic of fast, agile runners. The other options, such as "behind," "loose," "feverishly," and "slowly," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the consequences of not choosing the right amount of food for breakfast will be discussed. The option "overeating" relates to consuming too much food, which can cause discomfort like indigestion, heartburn, and stomach ache. "Gain energy" does not affect directly from the amount of food consumed, but from the quality of food chosen.
The sentence suggests that John saw a billboard every day on his way to work, indicating that the billboard was located somewhere along his route. Since the choices are all geographic locations, we can eliminate Texas, Las Vegas, and the countryside, as these options do not have a clear connection to a street. Similarly, a football ground would not typically have billboards visible from the street. Therefore, the correct answer must be street.
The sentence suggests that John is joining others at a table, which is commonly associated with a meeting or gathering. Meeting usually refers to a formal or informal gathering of people for a specific purpose, often with an agenda, and this could explain why John is joining others at the table. The other options like construction, kitchen, internet cafe, and building do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the goal is to gain more land, but there are few resources available. This suggests that simply buying land or property may not be feasible. Saving or earning money might be difficult if resources are already limited. Working could be a way to gain resources and potentially acquire more land in the future.
The sentence suggests that the support team is responding to a disaster, which implies that they are there to provide assistance or aid to people affected by the disaster. The other options do not fit the context. "Family" and "marriage" are not directly related to responding to a disaster, while "let down" and "neglect" have negative connotations that do not fit with the idea of a support team providing help.
The word "attributes" suggests that the question is referring to a list or set of characteristics or qualities. An "array" is a term commonly used to describe a systematic display of data or information, such as a table or matrix. On-screen is a possible display option, but it is not a universally applicable answer. The other options, calculus and calculas, are misspelled variations of the correct term. The term "description" is too vague and could refer to any number of ways to present information.
Climbing a mountain involves ascending to a higher elevation, which is reflected in the choice "getting higher." Falling down and vertigo are not activities associated with mountain climbing, and elevation is a description of the change in height. Accomplishment could be a result of climbing a mountain, but it is not a description of the activity itself.
The sentence suggests that the politician is embarrassed and is expected to give a resignation speech. The press people are waiting for him, which indicates that there is likely a scandal or controversy surrounding the politician. The word "confession" fits with this context as it suggests that the politician may admit to wrongdoing or wrongdoing may be revealed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "a failure" suggests that the person is not successful or achieving their goals. "Insulted" and "hold back" do not convey the same meaning and are not synonymous with failure. "Illusion" means something that is not real or true, which is not related to the context of the question. "Lower expectations" may be a consequence of being a failure, but it is not synonymous. "Amount to nothing" means to have no success or impact, which accurately describes someone who is a failure.
The context of the sentence implies that the children will react excitedly when the candy is brought to them. "Spring into action" implies a sudden burst of movement or excitement, which is likely to be the response of children who are given candy. This option is the most fitting in the context of the sentence. The other choices do not make sense given the scenario described.
The most common place to store perishable items like beer is in a refrigerator or fridge. We know that the beer is being kept at home, so options like sporting event or bowling alley do not make sense. A bucket may be used for holding ice and keeping drinks cool, but it's not typically where someone would store beer long-term. A bar could be a place where beer is served, but the question is asking about where someone would keep their own beer at home.
The sentence indicates that the action of applying heat to combustible materials is being described. Combustible materials are those that are capable of catching fire and burning, so it is reasonable to expect that the correct answer would involve some kind of burning or combustion. The other options do not accurately describe the expected outcome of applying heat to combustible materials.
The sentence suggests that there is a cultural difference in the perception of a specific type of bathroom in an apartment. The word "outhouse" refers to an external facility used for waste disposal, and would be considered odd to have in an apartment by some cultures. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not imply an external facility or cultural differences in bathroom design.
A double-edged razor is commonly used by butchers to make precise cuts in meat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The middle ages were characterized by a feudal system where the aristocracy held a significant amount of power and influence. A villain in that time period may have been someone who used their position of power for nefarious purposes, making them an aristocrat. The other options do not fit the context of a villain in the middle ages.
The sentence suggests that the context is underwater exploration, specifically regarding a shipwreck. The use of the word "robotic" implies that machines have already been used to check out the shipwreck, which may indicate that a human is needed to provide additional information. A submarine is a vehicle specifically designed for underwater exploration and could potentially provide more information than any of the other options listed. The other options are not related to underwater exploration and have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman gave something to a child after experiencing trouble for a prolonged period of time. Giving birth to a child would be a common interpretation of the sentence, as it is a significant event that would likely require a lot of effort and could be considered a "trouble". The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man's main motive for going fishing was not to catch fish for survival or to fulfill any other serious purpose. Instead, the use of the phrase "going fishing" suggests a leisure activity that is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment. The other options like relaxation, talking to someone, boredom, or killing do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "having fun."
The phrase "communicate in public streets" suggests that the speaker is engaging in public speaking or addressing a crowd. The goal of such communication is usually to share a message or to persuade others to take a specific action, which is consistent with the choice "speak out." The other options, such as "death," "send email," "listen," and "think," do not make sense in the context of public speaking.
Roller coasters are a popular attraction at amusement parks, which often require visitors to purchase tickets or passes to gain access to the rides. Train stations, venues, banks, and fairgrounds are not typically associated with roller coasters or ticket booths.
The sentence suggests that James put the tea away after he poured it into a container, which implies that he kept it in a storage space of some sort. The most likely option for this type of scenario would be a cupboard, as it is a common storage area for kitchen items such as tea. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they are either irrelevant (internet cafe) or do not make sense for storing tea (teapot, refrigerator).
The sentence suggests that when a person loses weight, their body fat goes through a certain process. The word "shrinking" implies that the fat cells are decreasing in size or quantity, which is a common result of weight loss. The other options do not make sense in this context - weight loss and hunger are already mentioned in the sentence, death is not directly related to weight loss itself, and decomposition is not a process associated with losing weight.
The use of the word "displayed" suggests that the cornet was part of a collection that was open to the public for viewing. While all options may have been a possible location for the cornet, a museum would make the most sense because it is a place specifically designed for displaying artifacts and works of art for public viewing. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
Groceries that you buy are typically perishable items that need to be stored in cool temperatures to keep them fresh. The most common place to store groceries at home is in the refrigerator. The other options, such as supermarket, pantry, shelf, and trunk, are not places where groceries would typically be stored at home.
The sentence refers to space, planets, and moons, which are all part of the larger system that includes everything we can observe. This system is commonly known as the universe. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James is bitter because of his wheelchair-bound condition, which indicates a sense of frustration or dissatisfaction with his limitations. Out of the given choices, being grateful would be the most appropriate contrast to his bitterness. It implies that James should appreciate what he has rather than focusing on what he doesn't have. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that people are looking for a recreational activity to do in the summer. The options "confession," "meetings," and "supermarket" do not fit this idea. "Carnival" could be a possibility, but "state park" is a more general option that could offer a range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, fishing, or camping, making it the most appropriate choice.
The word "committee" suggests a group of people who are working together on an ongoing basis, typically within a business or organization. The word "meeting" indicates that the group will be discussing something important, and the context suggests that they will be doing so in a professional setting. The options "church", "zoo", and "city hall" do not fit this description, and so can be eliminated. The option "office building" is more general than "boardroom", which specifically refers to a room in which a company's leadership would meet to make decisions and discuss important matters. Therefore, the most logical answer is "boardroom".
The context of the sentence suggests that the person has stopped having food, which means that they are no longer eating. The other options suggest reasons why someone may continue to have food, such as getting fat or being hungry, which do not fit the context of the sentence. Being full, on the other hand, is a common reason why someone may stop eating, as they may feel satisfied and no longer need to consume more food at that time.
The sentence suggests that the diaphragm was used to turn off the water, which indicates that it is a type of valve. A valve is a device that controls the flow of a fluid (usually a gas or liquid) in a pipeline or similar system. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to farming, and snakes are commonly found in fields where crops are grown. Farmers may be startled by snakes in the fields because they can damage crops or pose a threat to livestock. The other options - tropical forest, tree, pet shops, and book stores - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A diaphragm is a muscle located at the bottom of the ribcage that aids in breathing by contracting and expanding the chest cavity. Humans, along with other mammals like dogs and cats, have a diaphragm. The other options are not relevant to the question or context of the sentence.
When a person is choking, they are unable to breathe properly and may start to turn blue due to lack of oxygen. This is a known symptom of choking and would help a person choose the correct answer from the given choices. The other options do not have any clear connection to choking.
The sentence suggests that a person is searching for more meaning in life, which commonly leads to religious beliefs. The option "believe in god" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence's context. Options such as "gain weight" and "own car" are irrelevant and have no connection to the sentence. "Thank God" and "experience joy" may be associated with religious beliefs but are not the most appropriate answers in this context, as the sentence does not suggest gratitude or pleasure.
The sentence suggests that the glass window was delicate and easily broken. The word "transparent" also implies that the glass was clear and easy to see through. The word "thin" further reinforces the idea that the glass was not strong or sturdy. "Soft" and "half empty" do not make sense in the context of describing a glass window, and "recyclable" is not relevant to the situation.
The context of the sentence suggests that air conditioning is being discussed in relation to work spaces. While it may be common to have air conditioning in homes, cars, movie theatres, and even cold rooms, the specific focus on work spaces indicates that offices are the correct answer. Air conditioning is often used in office buildings to help regulate temperature and create a more comfortable environment for employees to work in.
The word "passionate" suggests intense emotions, and the act of kissing is often associated with romantic or sexual feelings. Therefore, the most likely result of passionate kissing would be strong feelings, which could include attraction, love, or desire. The other options are either unrelated or present negative outcomes, which do not fit with the positive tone of the question.
Television is commonly used as a form of entertainment, whether it's watching a favorite show, movie, or sporting event. While it's possible to use television to check email or even fall asleep, the context of the answer suggests that the primary purpose is for enjoyment and leisure activities. The other options, getting tired and turning off, suggest a negative experience with television rather than a positive one.
The sentence describes a personal space that is decorated with posters, suggesting that it is a place where someone can freely decorate to their liking. It is unlikely to be the White House or a museum, which are public spaces with specific decorum. A school or apartment may not allow for personal decorations in shared areas. Therefore, the most likely option is a friend's house where Suzie can decorate her personal space with posters of her favorite celebrities and interests.
The sentence suggests that James separated his subjects by placing a divider between arithmetic and English. This implies that James has separate textbooks for each subject, and that he can continue using his math textbook even after he finishes his arithmetic class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The human eye is a feature commonly found on the face of a person, which is why "faces" and "person's head" are likely answers. "Potato" and "skull" do not have any connection to the context of the question and therefore can be eliminated as options. While "mammal" might be technically correct, it is too general and does not narrow down the answer enough.
The sentence refers to a specific location where Amelia tried to aim for a small isle, which suggests that the body of water in question must be significant enough to have an isle. While all the choices refer to bodies of water, only "body of water" is specific enough to describe the situation in the sentence. The other choices, such as "pool" or "auditorium," do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Dave's efforts to listen to his wife and understand her better resulted in both of them finding something. The word "satisfaction" implies that they both felt a sense of fulfillment or contentment as a result of their improved communication and understanding. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence, as they do not necessarily imply a positive outcome from Dave's actions.
The sentence implies that bad words were being said in a place of worship, which is likely to be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful. The phrase "mean things" suggests that the bad words were offensive or insulting in nature. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not specifically refer to the use of offensive language.
The context of the sentence suggests that the lawn being referred to is located on a street, which would make the front yard the most probable option. This is because front yards are typically located directly in front of a house and face the street, whereas green yards or suburbia could refer to any type of lawn in any location. A golf course is typically not found on a residential street, and Michigan is a state and not a type of lawn.
The question is asking about a common practice that occurs on a person's birthday. Giving gifts is a common tradition for birthdays, whereas the other options do not have a clear connection to birthdays. Receiving letters may occur on some birthdays, but it is not as common as giving gifts. Feeling embarrassed, going to the club, and thanking God may occur on some birthdays but are not universal practices.
The sentence suggests that during World War I, both sides used a method of causing death that has since been banned. This eliminates options such as nuclear weapons, which did not exist during World War I. Homicide is a general term for killing someone and doesn't specifically refer to the use of a weapon or method of causing death. Cyanide is a poisonous substance, but it was not used on a large scale during World War I as a weapon. "Massive weapons" is also a vague term and does not provide any specific information about what was used during the war. Thus, the correct answer is poisonous gas.
White foxes, also known as arctic foxes, are commonly found in cold regions such as the arctic tundra. Their white fur helps them blend in with the snowy environment and stay camouflaged from predators. The other options, such as the great outdoors or mountains, are too broad and do not necessarily indicate a specific habitat where white foxes are commonly found.
The sentence suggests that the sloth is held in captivity in a zoo outside of a city. Zoos commonly have cages or enclosures to house animals, so it is likely that the sloth would be found in a cage. The other options (encyclopedia, dictionary, and wilderness) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. While a sloth might be found in the countryside, it would be unlikely to find one in a small zoo outside of a city.
The sentence suggests that the person working in the office experienced a system crash, which would likely affect their ability to work on their computer. Therefore, they would need a new computer to continue their work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that life can take different paths for different people, and sometimes that means good friends need to separate or move in different directions. The phrase "part ways" often refers to the end of a friendship or relationship, indicating that this may be the correct answer. The other options (such as "comfort" or "eat cake") do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this context.
The sentence implies that the person is in need of nourishment, so the most appropriate solution would be to have some food. The other options may not address the specific need for sustenance and may not effectively alleviate hunger. Eating quickly, for example, may cause discomfort and indigestion. Eating vegetables or making bread may not readily provide an immediate solution to the need for food.
The key phrases in the question are "at most twice as large" and "positive integers." To get a result that is at most twice as large, you need to multiply the positive integer by a number that is at most 2. This is because any number greater than 2 would result in a product that is more than twice as large as the original number. Dividing or subtracting would result in a smaller number, while adding up numbers would result in a larger number. Writing down the number is not an operation that would change the value of the number.
The word "effect" implies that the TV had a negative impact on the kids, and the word "distracting" suggests that it prevented the kids from focusing on more productive activities. To "become adults" is a natural process that cannot be attributed to the TV, while "wonder about" and "open door" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Became healthy" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it is not related to the topic of the TV's impact on the kids.
The sentence indicates that Billy was doing his homework at the last minute and was struggling to think clearly, which suggests that he may have been tired or exhausted. Sneezing and allergies don't necessarily cause difficulty thinking, while cleanliness is not related to this context at all. Seizures are a possibility, but there is no direct indication in the sentence that Billy was experiencing one.
The context clues in the sentence suggest that the location being described is a very high point with an observation deck, indicating that it is likely a tall building such as a skyscraper. The other options like mall, book of stories, and apartment building do not fit the description of a high point with an observation deck.
The sentence mentions being pinched by a crab, which implies that the question is related to a beach or shoreline environment. The option "sandy beach" is the most likely correct answer because crabs are commonly found in coastal areas, and sandy beaches are a common type of beach environment where crabs may be present. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not specific enough.
The sentence suggests that James is trying to capture the beauty of the landscape, but he isn't good at it. This implies that James lacks skill in the specific area of capturing the beauty of landscapes. The phrase "he was never good at it" reinforces this idea. The other choices may be elements within the landscape, but they are not directly related to James' lack of skill in painting.
The sentence suggests that clothes have been washed. After washing, clothes typically come out wet and need to be hung up or put in a dryer to dry. The other options are not likely outcomes of washing clothes. "Cold cloth" does not make sense in this context, "shrinkage" and "wear out" describe negative effects that may occur over time with repeated washing, and "get wet" is redundant as clothes already are wet after washing.
Popcorn is a popular snack when going to see movies at a movie theater. It is not typically associated with the other options listed, such as a basketball game or carnival. While popcorn is sometimes available at live shows, it is not as commonly consumed in that context as it is in a movie theater setting.
The sentence suggests that the guns could have a malfunction if they are hit on the ground. The word "jam" specifically refers to a situation where the gun fails to fire properly due to a mechanical problem. The other options are either too general (e.g. "break") or too extreme (e.g. "shoot someone" or "take life") and do not accurately reflect what could happen if a gun is dropped or hit on the ground.
Pavement is a hard surface material used to cover the ground in order to make it easier to walk, drive, or ride on. It is commonly found on roads, sidewalks, and other public spaces that are meant for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. While it may often be associated with urban areas such as towns and city blocks, it can also be found in rural areas for things like driveways and pathways. A race track may also have pavement, but it is not a common use for this material.
The sentence mentions an island off the coast of California, which suggests that it is located in the Pacific Ocean, since California is on the west coast of the United States and the Pacific Ocean is to the west of California. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they are either landforms or unrelated bodies of water.
The sentence implies that the person ate a lot, and the word "satisfyingly" suggests that they enjoyed it. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to a feeling of pleasure or contentment after eating. The options "stomach aches" and "full belly" suggest discomfort or overindulgence, which contradicts the idea of feeling satisfied. "Getting full" and "full stomach" are too vague and don't convey a sense of enjoyment or satisfaction. Therefore, "satisfaction" is the most appropriate choice for the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking about a common emotion people feel when something good happens. Joy is a common positive emotion that people experience when they receive good news, accomplish a goal, or have a positive experience. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence and are not commonly associated with positive emotions.
The sentence mentions "burnout from staying too long at home," indicating that the person is experiencing exhaustion or fatigue from being stuck inside for an extended period of time. The best way to combat burnout in this scenario would be to engage in relaxation activities, such as meditation, yoga, or taking a warm bath. "Elapsed time" does not provide a solution to the problem, "exit" is not relevant to the context, "uneasiness" is the opposite of what is desired, and "getting there" is not applicable to resolving burnout from staying at home.
A bound stack of papers that form a single continuous volume, often containing a text or multiple texts, is commonly referred to as a book. The other options have no clear connection to the description of a bound stack of papers. A classroom is a space in which students are taught, a cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, a notebook is a small book used for taking notes, and a suitcase is a container used for carrying clothes and belongings during travel.
The question is asking for something that should not be done when trying to get in shape. Jogging, drinking water, period of recovery, and dieting are all positive actions that can contribute to getting in shape. "Give up" is the only option that suggests a negative action that would hinder progress towards fitness goals.
The sentence suggests that the teacher is checking belts, which is a common safety measure for buses. The context of the sentence also indicates that the students are getting ready to leave, which further supports the idea that they are on a bus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
While airplanes can certainly catch on fire or stall, and can also fly in the clouds and accelerate, the primary purpose of airplanes is to transport people or cargo. In this case, the language choice "carry" implies something being transported, and "freight" specifically refers to cargo or goods being shipped.
Hospitals are known for being places where people go to get medical treatment for illnesses or injuries. Therefore, it makes sense that people trying to alleviate suffering would be found in hospitals. In contrast, a hockey game, apartment, kitchen, or water cooler do not have the same connotations of people attempting to alleviate suffering.
The sentence suggests that there is one thing that is necessary for every human to play a harmonica, and the answer choice "mouth" is the only option that makes sense in the context of playing a musical instrument. The other options, such as "wings" and "pocket," are not relevant to playing a harmonica. "Music shop" and "blues band" may be helpful in obtaining a harmonica or playing with others, but they are not necessary for playing the instrument itself.
Playing games on computers is primarily for entertainment purposes, and the enjoyment factor is a key aspect of gaming. While some video games may have educational value, the main motivation for most people to play games is the fun and excitement they provide. The other options listed don't fit the context of the question, and are not typically associated with playing games on computers.
The sentence suggests that someone has hurt someone else that the person loves. In this context, it is likely that the person will feel resentment towards the person who caused harm to their loved one. Resentment is a common emotional response to feeling wronged or violated, especially when it involves someone we care about. The other options do not reflect the emotional response that is likely in this scenario.
The name of the baseball team, Cubs, is an abbreviation of its original name, the Chicago Cubs. Therefore, the stadium where the Cubs play their home games is located in Chicago. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, except for maybe urban areas, which is too broad and general.
The question asks for an activity that can help people organize when they have a lot to do. Making lists is a commonly recommended strategy for organization, as it allows people to visually and mentally prioritize their tasks and keep track of what needs to be done. The other options are not directly related to organization or may not be effective strategies for it.
The description of the food being "round bread covered with cheese and pepperoni" is commonly associated with pizza. Pizza places are known for baking and serving different types of pizza, which can be customized to the customer's liking. None of the other options - restaurant, prison, refrigerator, and own home - have any clear connection to serving pizzas.
The question is asking about where people would typically use umbrellas when it is raining. The most common place for people to use umbrellas during rain is when they are walking on a street, as it allows them to stay dry while commuting or running errands. The other options (forest, under the water, Disneyland) do not make logical sense in the context of the question, and weather is too broad of an answer to accurately choose.
The sentence suggests that the situation described involves a loss or separation, and the context of ending a marriage implies a significant emotional event. If the person is still in love but the relationship isn't working out, they are likely to feel sad or depressed about the end of the marriage, even if they may also feel relief from the struggles they were facing. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence explicitly states that the person and their friends had a "wonderful" weekend trip, indicating that they likely enjoyed their time together and created positive experiences. Memories are lasting and can be cherished for a lifetime, making them a logical answer choice. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as the sentence does not suggest that the group gained any new knowledge, property, or offspring. Friendship bracelets, while a nice gesture, do not necessarily last a lifetime.
The context of the question implies that winning is a possible outcome of playing a certain type of game. The choices "having fun," "entertain," and "injury" do not suggest a specific game that can result in winning. "Competition" is a possibility, but it is too broad to choose a specific game that could result in winning. However, "checkers" is a specific game that involves competition and can result in winning.
The sentence suggests that Tim flies airplanes that are not used for carrying passengers, which leaves only a few possible options. Arriving late, catching on fire, and teaching do not seem relevant to the context. Taxiing might be an option, but the sentence emphasizes that Tim doesn't have to worry about passengers, which suggests he is not transporting people. Therefore, carrying freight is the most likely choice. Freight planes are commonly used to transport cargo, and do not have the same concerns as commercial passenger planes.
The phrase "getting in line" suggests that people are queuing up for something, and the options "follow others," "late," and "have to wait for" do not necessarily explain why someone would be in line. "Wait turn" is the most straightforward answer, as people often wait in line to take turns for something like a ride, attraction, or to order at a busy restaurant. "Longer lines" could also be a possible answer, but it is less specific than "wait turn."
The sentence suggests that the person is only listening and not speaking, which implies that they are not actively participating in a conversation or exchanging ideas. The other options may be relevant in other contexts, but here the focus is on receiving or gathering information from the speaker. Therefore, the correct answer is "obtaining information."
The sentence suggests that the speaker is questioning the sincerity of the woman's love for him, and implies that if her love were true, she would wait for him. This suggests that the speaker is leaving and may be gone for some time, which would require the woman to wait for him if she truly loves him. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the proper placement of a wedding ring before proposing, suggesting that the ring should already be on a specific location before the proposal takes place. The most logical option is "finger" as that's where the ring is traditionally worn after a proposal. The other options don't make sense in this context.
The phrase "in case of emergency" suggests that the candle is being kept for use during a power outage or other type of unexpected situation. Keeping a candle in a dimly lit room makes the most sense in this context, as it would provide light where there otherwise would not be any. The other options are not relevant to the idea of an emergency situation.
The word "native" suggests that the answer is referring to the natural or original habitat of mice. While mice can live in a variety of places, their natural habitat is typically in fields or wooded areas, which are typically found in the countryside. The other options, such as attic or laboratory, are not a mouse's native habitat but rather places where they may end up due to human activity.
The sentence implies that the sick person is no longer sick, which is typically associated with getting better. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not correspond with the idea of recovering from an illness. "Throw up" and "scuba dive in the bath" are unrelated actions, while "battle cancer" implies a more serious and ongoing illness, and "take medicine" refers to a treatment that may help the sick person get better, but not necessarily guarantee their recovery.
The verb "praying" suggests that the context is related to religion or spirituality. The phrase "leading to the desired outcome" implies that the person who prayed wanted something specific to happen. "Being comforted" is a likely result of praying, as it is often seen as a form of seeking emotional support and reassurance from a higher power. The other options may also be associated with prayer or spirituality, but they are not as directly related to the desired outcome or the act of praying itself.
The word "bazaar" typically refers to a marketplace or street market in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries. While bazaars can be found in other parts of the world as well, they are not as common in the US. Therefore, the most likely option for what someone would call a bazaar in the US is "festival", which can refer to a variety of events that involve food, music, and vendors selling goods. The other options refer to specific regions or cities and do not have a direct connection to the concept of a bazaar.
The sentence implies a connection between drinking coffee in the morning and gaining energy for a particular activity. The context of drinking coffee during a commute suggests that the activity in question is likely work, as many people drink coffee to help them stay alert and focused during work hours. The other options, such as playing sports or wrestling, do not align with the context of the sentence or the typical benefits of drinking coffee. Obesity and fatigue may be negative effects of a lack of energy, but they are not activities or goals that require extra energy.
Municipal parks are a common location for recreational facilities like tennis courts, but they are not the only places where you can find them. College campuses and country clubs are also known for having tennis courts. High schools may have tennis courts, but they are less likely to be open to the public. Michigan and town are not relevant to the context of the question since they do not provide information about where tennis courts can be located.
Beer contains alcohol which, when consumed in large quantities, can lead to intoxication. Intoxication can cause impaired judgment, loss of coordination, and other effects that would not be associated with self control or relaxation. While pleasure may be a side effect of drinking beer, it is not necessarily a result of buying too much beer specifically. Problems could also be a consequence of buying too much beer, but the question is specifically asking about what might happen after the purchase.
The sentence suggests that the man did not consider the impact his suicide would have on others, specifically the pain it would cause them. This is a common consequence of suicide, as the loved ones left behind often experience intense grief and emotional pain. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of suicide or the emotions associated with it.
The sentence mentions that the elephant's trunk is above the water while swimming, suggesting that it is using it to breathe. Elephants are known to use their trunk as a snorkel while swimming to breathe, as they cannot hold their breath for long periods of time. The options "experience sadness," "choke," "remember everything," and "forget nothing" do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the situation being described is related to a place where there are light bulbs that can fade into darkness. The options "theatre," "sunrise," "twilight," "basement," and "lamp" do not necessarily have clear connections to this context. "Room" is the most likely choice as it is a common place where light bulbs are found and can fade into darkness if the lights are turned off or if the bulb burns out.
The sentence suggests that hurting someone is a crime and the person could face consequences for it. Jail time is a common punishment for committing a crime and is therefore the most likely option. Punishment is a more generic option that could apply to any type of consequence, but jail time is a specific consequence that is commonly associated with crimes. Bad karma and will resent are not legal consequences and are therefore unlikely options. A fight is also not a legal consequence and is not a appropriate response to a crime.
The sentence suggests that the question is about where to store groceries while driving home in a car. The only option that makes sense for this context is the trunk of a car. The other options, such as grocery cart and supermarket, are not relevant to the context. Pantry and shelf are not applicable choices as they are not part of a car.
Fresh produce, including potatoes, is commonly sold at farmer's markets, which are known for carrying locally grown and harvested fruits and vegetables. Deep sea and bushel basket have no connection to potatoes. While Ireland is known for potatoes, the answer is asking where one can buy a fresh potato, and not necessarily in Ireland specifically. A grocery bag may contain potatoes, but it does not specify if they are fresh or not, as grocery stores may sell both fresh and pre-packaged potatoes.
The sentence suggests that the students were instructed to sit quietly, but the "trouble child" did not comply with this instruction, indicating that they did something else instead. Among the choices provided, "lay down" seems to be the most opposite of "sit down," and therefore the most likely option. "Listen" and "meditate" would fall under the category of listening and following instructions, which the "trouble child" did not do. "Alone" is not an action, and therefore does not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of waiting for a response from an interview suggests that the individual is likely experiencing feelings of uncertainty, nervousness, and anticipation. These emotions are commonly associated with anxiety, which is a state of heightened mental and physical arousal in response to perceived threats or challenges. The other options, such as having fun or feeling tedious, do not fit the context of waiting for a response from an interview. Patience and impatience are related to waiting, but they do not accurately reflect the emotional state that typically accompanies waiting for an important outcome like a job interview.
The sentence provides a specific location, Butte, which is a city in the state of Montana. "Countryside" might be a possible option, but it is too broad and generic of a term to accurately describe the location of the ranch house. "Neighborhood" and "subdivision" imply a more urban or suburban setting, while "desert" is not a likely location for a ranch house in Montana. Therefore, "montana" is the best answer.
The sentence is asking about a device with a lens that is used for taking photos. While a microscope and telescope also require optics (lens), they are not typically used for taking photos. A spoon is obviously not a device for taking photos. A camera, on the other hand, is specifically designed to take photos using a lens.
The sentence suggests that Joe got a toy for his child (a plush bald eagle), rather than a live animal. This rules out options like pet shop, great outdoors, and nature reserve. The fact that it is a plush toy implies that it was purchased from a store that sells toys, which would be a toy store. Canada is an unlikely option as it is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The definition of a birthday involves marking the anniversary of a person's birth, which means celebrating when they have reached a new age. "Funeral", "die", and "obesity" are all irrelevant and negative options, and "happy" is too broad and doesn't relate specifically to the context of a birthday celebration.
The sentence suggests that the act of traveling is straightforward and uncomplicated. The phrase "just" implies that the answer is something basic or easy. "Relocation" implies a permanent move, rather than just traveling. "Disorientation" implies confusion or unease, which contradicts the idea that traveling is simple. "Meeting new people" is not necessarily a requirement for traveling. "Statue" is not related to the context of the sentence. "Getting somewhere" is the most straightforward and simple answer that aligns with the context of the sentence.
Leaves naturally belong on trees, as they are an important part of the tree's life cycle. Leaves collect sunlight to produce food through photosynthesis, and when they fall from the tree they provide nutrients to the soil. They can also provide shelter for animals and insects. The other options either don't make sense or would be harmful to the environment (e.g. leaving leaves in the street could block drains and cause flooding).
The sentence implies that the person being described does not believe in a higher power or deity, and "godless" is a commonly used term to describe such individuals. "Humdrum" and "horrible" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, and "undivine" is not a commonly used term to describe a lack of belief in a divine being.
The sentence suggests that when hair becomes too long and heavy, it becomes difficult to handle or style. Cutting it would make it easier to manage, meaning it would be more manageable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not mean easier to handle or style.
It is well-known that dreaming is a common occurrence during human sleep. While some individuals may remember their dreams more frequently than others, it is widely accepted that dreaming is a natural part of the sleep cycle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The context suggests that the spoon is being used for eating. Glass of iced tea or serving dish does not require a spoon to be used, kitchen drawer and dishwasher are not logical places to put a spoon before adding food to it, and dinner is not an object that a spoon can be put next to. Therefore, the correct answer must be bowl of soup, as it is the only option that requires the use of a spoon for eating.
The question is asking for a commonly held belief about what happens after death. While some people may believe in cessation of movement, breath, or life, the option "go to heaven" is a commonly held belief in many religions and cultures. "Nothing" is also a possible answer, but "go to heaven" is a more specific and commonly-believed outcome.
Fear is a common and instinctual response to danger, and children often rely on this emotion to alert them to potential danger. Research has shown that even very young children are able to identify threatening or unsafe situations based on their emotional response. While some of the other options may be related to danger in certain contexts (such as listening for a noise that could indicate danger), experiencing fear is the most widely recognized and reliable indicator of danger for children.
The sentence suggests that the jury was tasked with making a decision regarding the sentence for a criminal defendant. "Passing sentence" is a phrase commonly used in legal contexts to refer to the act of deciding what punishment to impose on a convicted individual. "Judgement" is a term often used in legal settings to describe a decision reached by a court or jury. "Court house" and "go to jail" are not relevant to this particular sentence, while "death" and "appeals" are potentially related to legal proceedings but do not directly address the question of what the jury had to do to pass sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a connection between hockey and a dentist being busy, indicating that there may be an increased demand for dental services in an area where hockey is popular. Minnesota is known for being home to several professional hockey teams and having a strong hockey culture, making it a likely choice for where a dentist may be busy due to hockey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks where to get corn if you don't have any, which suggests that you need to acquire it from somewhere else. The most common place to buy corn is at a supermarket, which is a retail store that sells groceries and other household items. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the question, as Pennsylvania is a state, silos and containers are storage facilities, and husks are a part of the corn plant.
The sentence suggests that the young lady was drawn to the man's wealth and did not mind his age. "Old" is the only option that directly relates to age, while the other options do not provide any direct clue to the man's age. "Youngstock" may refer to young animals, "aged" may refer to something that has been aged, but it does not necessarily refer to age in humans, and "mature" and "senior" are often used to denote a certain stage in life but do not necessarily mean old age.
The sentence suggests that the lizard was originally kept in captivity at the zoo, but the protester stole it and returned it to its natural habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is "wild." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a glass cage is still a form of captivity, a restaurant is not a suitable habitat for a lizard, a garden may not be a suitable habitat for the specific type of lizard in question, and the Galapagos Archipelago is too far away and too specific to be a plausible answer.
The question asks about learning different ways of seeing the world, which is a topic that is often explored in philosophy. Studying philosophy involves examining different perspectives and ways of thinking about the world, which can lead to a deeper understanding of how people perceive the world around them. The other options do not have a clear connection to the topic of learning different ways of seeing the world.
The word "trance" suggests a state of altered consciousness that is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness. The other options, such as sleepwalking or memory loss, do not match the typical characteristics of a trance state. Hypnotized individuals may feel relaxed, but the term "trance" typically refers to a self-induced state of deep relaxation rather than a state induced by a hypnotist. Confusion is not typically associated with trance states.
The sentence suggests that Sarah was managing an evacuation in a location that was difficult to navigate. The phrase "all around them" implies that the environment was a factor in why managing the evacuation was challenging. Of the options listed, "desert" is the most likely to present logistical difficulties during a crisis situation. The other options, such as "Egypt" or "city," could be challenging in their own right, but do not necessarily suggest the same kinds of obstacles as a desert environment.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person who answered the door was doing so in response to the mailman's knock. The most likely scenario following this interaction would be for the person to receive mail from the mailman. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
The question is asking about where someone doing housework is likely to work, so it makes the most sense that they would be working in a nice home, as housework is typically associated with maintaining a clean and tidy living space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, as they are either unrelated or not indicative of where housework is likely to take place.
The sentence implies that Jan struggles with studying and needs some form of assistance. Out of the given options, "understanding" makes the most sense in this context because gaining a better understanding of the material he is studying would likely improve his ability to learn and retain information. The other options (having a bigger brain, headaches, inspiration, and more intelligence) do not offer realistic or practical solutions to Jan's problem.
The sentence implies that Charlie did not live near a school, which makes it unlikely that he attended one. The sentence also suggests that Charlie had a desire to learn, which makes it more likely that he turned to self-education. Of the choices, reading books is the most likely method for self-education, as it can be done at any time and from any location. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence suggests that celebrating sports teams can sometimes become uncontrollable and chaotic. "Riots" is the most logical choice as it is commonly associated with such situations. "Dashing each others" is nonsensical and "intimacy" and "happiness" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Headaches" is a possible consequence of a riot, but it is not the best answer given the other choices.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to physical activity or exercise, specifically running. When you run, your body warms up and generates heat, which can cause your feet to sweat and your shoes to feel hot. The other options, such as losing laces or feeling tired, may be possible outcomes of running but are not directly related to what could happen to your shoes in this situation.
The sentence implies a potential danger when fishing in a river and falling down, which could lead to a bear attack. Fishing and hiking in bear country require safety precautions, such as carrying bear spray, making noise and keeping a safe distance from wildlife. The other options are not related to falling down while fishing in a river.
The sentence mentions Bob raising a curtain, which suggests that he might work in a theater. Moreover, the sentence hints at a crowded atmosphere, which is commonly associated with theaters during performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for the opposite of "unhappy," which is a word commonly associated with the emotion of sadness or a negative feeling. The other options are all synonyms of "happy" or express positive emotions, but do not fit the context of the question as an opposite. "Fat" is not a relevant option as it is not a feeling or emotion.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to the act of murder, which typically involves taking someone else's life. Therefore, the requirement for committing murder is that someone must die. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that Sam would cry while watching the movie implies that it had a sad or emotional storyline. The other answer choices are either too extreme or do not accurately reflect the tone of the movie as described in the sentence. "Were sad" is the best fit because it conveys the idea that the movie was emotionally moving and likely had a sad ending or storyline.
The verb "take flight" suggests that the answer involves a mode of transportation that can fly or lift off the ground. Out of the options listed, only "aircraft" fits this description as it refers to vehicles designed for air travel. The other options - school, band, factory, and car - do not have any connection to flight or air travel.
The sentence suggests that the person in question valued formality and likely made an effort to display proper social behavior. Making eye contact is one of the key ways to establish a connection and show respect when talking to others. The other options may also be effective ways of showing respect and formality, but they are not as directly connected to the sentence as making eye contact.
The sentence suggests that dogs need to stay hydrated on hot days, which is why it's important to keep their bowl full. "Require water" is the answer that directly addresses this need for hydration. "Do many things," "trained," "withstand dehydration," and "get lost" are not related to the context of the sentence and do not answer the question asked.
In the context of the sentence, the family wants to buy a heater to warm their living space. Therefore, the correct answer is "house." The other options (automobile, city hall, public building, office) do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not typically require or benefit from having a heater installed.
A business telephone directory is typically used in a professional or work setting, so it would make sense to keep it in an office where it would be easily accessible to employees who need it. The other options, such as a house or phone booth, do not make sense as places to keep a business telephone directory. Book shelves or a building might be possible options, but office is the most specific and appropriate choice given the context.
The sentence implies that James needed to store his duffel bag temporarily because he couldn't carry it with him. The options "bag lady's shopping cart" and "army barracks" are not likely locations for James to store his personal belongings. "Bus station" and "transit" are also unlikely options as they imply that James was travelling, which is not specified in the sentence. "Locker room" is the most suitable option as it is a common place for people to store their personal items when they don't want to carry them around.
The sentence suggests that the protagonist found something amusing while hiking, and that it was related to a saying. The next part of the sentence mentions "spotted a what," implying that the protagonist saw something on the mountain. The word "Chuckled" suggests that whatever he saw was not serious or dangerous. Thus, among the options, a molehill fits the context best. It is a small and harmless feature of the landscape that is not commonly spotted while hiking, and it can be humorously compared to a mountain. The other options don't fit as well because they are either too big or too difficult to spot while hiking.
The sentence suggests that Joe did something very bad and is worried about being punished by The People. Going to jail is a common punishment for criminal activities and is a reasonable choice for Joe to be worried about. The other options, such as train or hatred, do not make sense in the context of punishment. "Get angry" and "public outrage" are not punishments but rather emotional responses to Joe's actions.
The sentence suggests that people are engaging in a sedentary lifestyle by sitting on the couch all day, which is a behavior commonly associated with watching TV. The comparison to a bad diet implies that this behavior is unhealthy. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that we are looking for an adjective to describe something related to television that we enjoy watching a lot. The option "entertaining" fits this description as it means something that is enjoyable or amusing. The other options "legal," "complex expensive and inflexible," "obsolete," and "awesome" do not necessarily have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when people are presented with hard science facts, some of them tend to turn away from their previously held beliefs, which is a characteristic commonly associated with atheism. Atheism is a lack of belief in a god or gods, and scientific facts and evidence can contradict many religious beliefs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the horses are moving quickly in a specific direction, which is a characteristic of the canter gait. Canter is a three-beat gait that is faster than a trot, but not as fast as a gallop. Trot is a two-beat diagonal gait, while eat oats and drink water are completely unrelated to the question. Herd may be a possible distraction, but it refers to a group of animals, not their movement.
Apple trees require soil to grow in, as this is where they obtain the necessary nutrients and water for their growth. They also require seeds to start growing, as this is how apple trees reproduce. The other options, South Africa, park, and paradise, are not relevant to the growth of apple trees.
The context suggests that the tourists were in a location where they had access to a swimming pool that was separated from the rest of the country, indicating that they were likely in a private, controlled setting such as a resort hotel. The other options, such as a jungle or a motel, do not typically have such amenities and would not be likely places for an isolated swimming pool. The YMCA and California are both too broad to determine whether they have isolated swimming pools.
The sentence suggests that the object is specifically designed for storing and dispensing pills. The options "medicine cabinet," "pharmacy," and "box" are too general and could refer to a variety of objects that may or may not be used for storing pills. "Jar" is too vague and does not necessarily imply a twisting motion to dispense pills. "Medicine bottle" is the most specific and appropriate option, as it is a common household item used for storing and dispensing medication, and often requires a twisting motion to open.
The sentence suggests that Sam believes that improving oneself involves taking time to collect one's thoughts and clear one's mind. This sort of self-improvement would likely result in a person feeling better about themselves, which is the best answer choice in the given options. The other options - learning something new, doing yoga, meditating, and celebrating - do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the idea of improving oneself through reflection and mental preparedness.
The sentence is asking about the location of something or someone (in this case, God). The phrase "at all times" suggests that God is believed to be omnipresent, or present everywhere at once. This is a common belief in many religions and is often described as one of God's attributes. The other options do not relate to the concept of God's location.
A market is a place where goods or services are bought and sold, and often has multiple vendors offering a variety of products for sale. The other options do not necessarily involve buying and selling products, or do not fit the context of the sentence (such as "cost one dollar"). A shelf may have products for sale, but it suggests a more limited selection and is often associated with retail stores rather than a marketplace. A salon is typically associated with personal services such as haircuts or beauty treatments, rather than buying products, and a demonstration suggests a presentation or exhibition rather than a commercial venue for selling goods.
Music is often played in elevators to create a calming and pleasant atmosphere. While music may be played in other settings such as malls or buildings, hotels are particularly known for playing background music in elevators to enhance the guest experience. The other options do not have any clear association with the practice of playing music in elevators.
The sentence suggests that the book is enjoyable and keeping the reader's interest, which is commonly associated with entertainment. While reading a good book may also lead to gaining knowledge, understanding, and a new perspective, the context of the sentence focuses on the enjoyment of the reading experience.
The sentence suggests that a small grain of sand can have a transformative effect on something, and the answer choice that fits this context best is "eye." This is because pearls are formed when a grain of sand gets inside an oyster or mollusk's shell and irritates its soft tissue. Over time, the mollusk will secrete a substance called nacre around the sand particle, which creates a smooth, shiny surface that we recognize as a pearl. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to this process.
When a tree is first growing, it is still developing its branches and structure. As it grows, it will begin to branch out in various directions, creating a fuller and more complex shape. This is a natural process for trees, and is essential for their growth and survival. The other options do not make sense in the context of a tree that is just starting to grow.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to a specific subject, namely mathematics. Measuring triangles is a fundamental concept in geometry, which is a branch of mathematics. Additionally, the other choices are not related to the subject matter of the sentence and do not make sense contextually.
The question is asking what keeps a cigarette fresh, which suggests that the answer must relate to preserving the quality of the cigarette. The option "carton" is the most logical answer because a carton helps to protect the cigarettes from moisture and air that can cause them to dry out or lose their flavor. The other options are all unrelated or even harmful to keeping a cigarette fresh.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking to buy a fishing rod, which is a type of equipment used for fishing. Therefore, it would make sense to look for a store that specializes in selling sporting goods such as fishing equipment. The other options do not make sense in the context of buying a fishing rod.
The sentence mentions that humans buy shoes in pairs, which indicates that they are intended to be worn on both feet. The other choices are not relevant to the context and do not explain why shoes are sold in pairs.
Biting is the first step in the process of eating food. Chewing, drinking, and cooking are all actions that can happen during the eating process, but they do not explain how someone starts eating in the first place. Watching TV is also not related to the act of eating.
The word "variety" suggests that there are different types of bread available. Supermarkets typically offer a wide selection of bread, including specialty breads, artisanal breads, and international varieties. The other options (room, dinner, plastic bag, refrigerator) do not make sense in the context of the question and do not suggest a place where bread can be found.
The sentence implies that being too sure of one's learning can have a negative consequence. "Overconfidence" is a common outcome of being too sure of oneself, where someone may become complacent and stop seeking new knowledge. "Growth," "gaining knowledge," "enlightenment," and "knowing more" are all positive outcomes of learning and do not align with the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the people in question were looking for information on their political enemies, which suggests a desire to gain an advantage over them. In politics, information can often be used as a tool to gain leverage or influence over others, which is a key characteristic of power. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as understanding, answers, happiness, and knowledge do not necessarily lead to the acquisition of power.
The question suggests that there is a lack of precipitation, which means that there might not be enough water for the plants. Farmers typically have to water their plants manually or use irrigation systems during dry periods to ensure that their crops receive enough water to grow. Rising early, raising crops, planting, and canning produce are not directly related to the issue of a lack of precipitation.
The context of the sentence suggests that the shark has been stuffed and preserved as a specimen for display. This would typically be done in a museum or educational setting. The term "maritime" refers to things related to the sea, such as boats, navigation, and marine life, so a maritime museum would be a likely place to display a preserved shark. The other options - deep ocean, pope's office, pool hall, and great outdoors - do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
When a person goes jogging, their body begins to exert itself, leading to an increase in heart rate. This is because the body needs to pump more blood and oxygen to the muscles in order to sustain the physical activity. Eating ice cream is not typically associated with jogging, as it is a sugary food that can lead to heaviness in the stomach. While jogging can help with weight loss, it is not a direct activity that someone does while jogging. Getting tired and heavy breathing can be side effects of jogging, but they are not the main action that someone does while jogging.
The sentence suggests that the address label was attached to something that weighs 3 pounds, which rules out options like envelope, shelf, and desk drawer. Junk mail is also unlikely to weigh that much. A parcel, on the other hand, is a package or box that can easily weigh 3 pounds or more, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence mentions that there are many swamps in the southern U.S., which suggests that the answer should refer to a specific geographic feature commonly found in this region. A river delta is a landform created by the deposition of sediment at the mouth of a river, and is often associated with wetland habitats like swamps. Michigan is not located in the southern U.S. and is not known for its swamps, while Louisiana is famous for its wetlands and alligators but does not specify the geographic feature in question.
The sentence suggests that the teacher was responsible for changing diapers, which is a task commonly associated with working in a nursery school or preschool setting where young children are in attendance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man wants to catch his favorite show, which implies that he needs to watch television. Clapping, feeling happy, and relaxing do not directly relate to watching television, while recording the show might be an option, it is not necessarily the most likely thing for the man to do, as he simply wants to catch the show, not necessarily keep a copy of it.
The sentence mentions that "the humorous" is a bone, which suggests that this is a question related to anatomy. The humorous is actually a bone in the upper arm, specifically in the area between the shoulder and elbow joints. This bone is also known as the humerus, and it is one of the largest bones in the human body. The other options in the question do not have any connection to anatomy or the location of bones.
Bus stops, especially those located downtown, are typically operated and maintained by the city's transportation department or a contracted bus operator that operates in the city. Urban areas and towns may have bus stops as well, but they are less likely to be downtown and may be operated by a different entity. Airports, while they have bus stops, are not usually located downtown and are not responsible for operating city bus stops.
The question asks about a place where a spa is likely to be found alongside similar services, which suggests a location that specializes in health and wellness. Out of the given options, a health centre is the most likely option to offer a spa alongside other health-related services such as massages or acupuncture, for example. Sweden, backyard, house or country club do not necessarily have a clear connection to health and wellness services or spas.
The sentence suggests that thrill seeking people who love competition could possibly be found in one of the choices provided. Out of the options, "race cars" is the most likely choice as it is a competitive sport that involves speed and danger, attracting thrill seekers who enjoy taking risks. The other choices, such as "a taxi cab," "learn from each other," and "fear death," do not correlate with the idea of competing and seeking thrills. "Fight each other" could be seen as competitive, but the sentence implies that the choice is related to a specific activity or location, rather than a general behavior.
The sentence suggests that the man was preparing for a bath and was looking for a specific quality in the water. The phrase "being clear" indicates that the man was searching for water that was transparent and free from impurities or dirt. This is a common expectation when someone is preparing for a bath, as the purpose of the bath is usually to clean oneself. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "get wet" is not something one needs to search for when preparing for a bath, "bathing soap" is an accessory and not a quality of the water, "will drown" is not a desirable outcome of bathing, and "personal cleanliness" is the purpose of the bath, not a quality of the water.
The sentence implies that Sam's job involves handling cash as a cashier, and he is good at it despite the hectic and tiring nature of the job. Among the choices, only a supermarket is commonly known to have cashiers who may work in a standing position and handle a lot of customers, making it a more likely workplace for Sam. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "gentleman" suggests that the person in question is a male of good breeding and manners. The fact that he is from France is also relevant, as it suggests that he may be interested in joining a social or cultural organization where he can meet fellow French expats, or perhaps an international club where he can network and socialize with people from all over the world. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general (europe) or unrelated to the idea of socializing and networking (suit, university, church, restaurant).
The sentence clearly states that the presents she was getting were not what she wanted, which suggests she had expected or hoped for something specific. This indicates that she may have been looking forward to receiving a particular gift that did not end up being part of her presents, leading to disappointment. The other options, such as excitement or satisfaction, would not be appropriate in this context where the speaker is unhappy with the nature of the gifts they were receiving.
Dressing rooms are typically found in clothing stores, where customers try on clothes before purchasing them. Gyms have changing rooms, but not specifically for trying on clothes. The term "body" is too vague and could apply to any location that pertains to the human body. Department stores may have dressing rooms, but the context of the sentence specifically mentions "all types of things," which suggests a focus on clothing. Closets are located in homes and not typically available for public use.
The phrase "crossing over" is often used as a euphemism for dying or passing away. This suggests that the people mentioned in the sentence are referring to the fear of death. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Going into a trance is often associated with a state of altered consciousness that can be induced by various factors, such as repetitive chanting, music, or hypnosis. Hallucination, the perception of things that are not actually present, is a common experience during trance-like states. Disorientation, loss of control, closed eyes, and confusion may also occur during a trance, but they are not necessarily the reason for entering a trance state.
The question is asking what someone needs when they're feeling hunger, so the best answer would be the option that satisfies that need. Hunger is a biological signal that our bodies use to signal the need for food, so the correct answer would be "eating". The other options are either inappropriate (starvation) or specific foods that may or may not be able to satisfy hunger (hamburger, pizza) or a symptom of hunger rather than the need itself (discomfort).
The context of the sentence suggests that Sally is looking for a specific tool, which is a stepladder. A hardware store is a common place where one can buy different types of tools, including stepladders. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A construction worker's vehicle or tool shed may have a stepladder, but Sally wouldn't know where to find them. Elevators and store rooms are unlikely places to find a stepladder.
The question is asking where you would get knives if you don't have any. The most logical answer would be the kitchen, as that is where knives are typically kept in a household. The other options may also have knives, but they are less likely to have knives that are suitable for general use, such as cooking or cutting. A restaurant may have specialized knives for food preparation, but they may not be available for purchase. A sporting goods store may have knives for hunting or camping, but they may not be appropriate for everyday use. A drawer or backpack may have knives, but it is unclear where these items are located and if they are available for use.
The sentence suggests that the person is struggling to finish reading a book because they are tired or sleepy. The phrase "kept" implies that the person is trying to stay awake, but is having difficulty doing so. "Falling asleep" is the most likely choice because it accurately reflects this situation. "Sit" and "learning" do not make sense in this context, and "the light on" is a distractor that does not relate to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a border between Colorado and a neighboring nation, and that nation is two states away. The only option that fits this description is Mexico, as it shares a border with several US states, including Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, which are all directly or indirectly adjacent to Colorado. The other options do not fit the criteria described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the killing of a young community member has caused a strong emotional reaction among people. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Get in trouble" and "commit crime" imply that people are somehow responsible for the killing, which is not necessarily the case. "Die" and "getting hurt" are also not logical responses to the situation.
The sentence suggests that when people have no nourishment, they experience a negative consequence. The phrase "suffer hunger" directly relates to the lack of nourishment, whereas the other options do not. Boarding ships, studying books, playing computer games, and believing in god do not have a direct correlation to the lack of nourishment.
The context suggests that the woman was wearing tight jeans in order to draw attention to a particular part of her body. The word "thigh" in the sentence helps to narrow down the answer choices to those that are related to clothing or fashion. Of the options given, "bulge" is the only choice that suggests a visual aspect of the woman's appearance that might be emphasized by wearing tight clothing. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.

The context of the sentence suggests that Sahmbi was intentionally misleading someone about the location of a fugitive, and the reason he was doing this was to avoid facing consequences or punishment. The term "trouble" is often used to describe negative consequences that someone may face for their actions, which is why it is the most likely choice in this context. The other options do not fit as well because they do not convey the sense of negative consequences that the sentence suggests.
The word "ignorance" suggests a lack of knowledge or information about a particular topic. Therefore, the most logical answer would be to find information. The other options do not directly address the issue of not knowing something and may not lead to the acquisition of new knowledge.
The question is asking about where works would typically be located on the wall, which suggests that they would be displayed in a setting where people would typically view them. The most likely place for that to occur would be in a house or other building, such as a museum or gallery. The other options do not provide a clear context for where works would be displayed on the wall.
The question states that you are relaxing and have your eyes closed, which suggests that you are engaging in an activity that does not require visual focus. The options "read book", "watching tv", and "reading" all involve visual engagement, which is therefore unlikely. "Falling asleep" is also unlikely since the question specifies that you are still awake. "Listening to music", however, is an activity that can easily be done with eyes closed and also fits the context of relaxation.
The sentence suggests that the answer must be a body of water that is similar to a stream. A brook is a small, shallow stream, while a synagogue and pastry have no connection to the context of the sentence. An ocean is a large body of saltwater and is not similar to a stream. A cup of coffee is a beverage and not a body of water.
The sentence suggests that the lines on the car are related to racing, which is a sport associated with speed and competition. Stripes are commonly used on racing cars to identify them and to make them more visually appealing. The other options do not have any clear connection to racing or the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a specific reason why people participate in surfing, and the word "primarily" implies that this reason is the main motivation for most surfers. While getting in shape and getting wet may be secondary benefits of surfing, neither of these options reflects the main reason why people choose to partake in the sport. Shark attacks, although they are a risk associated with surfing, are not a reason why someone would choose to surf. Therefore, enjoyment is the most likely correct answer. Surfing is a popular recreational activity that is enjoyed by many people around the world, and the exhilaration of riding waves is often cited as the primary reason why people choose to participate in it.
When we exercise and run, our body temperature increases, and we start to sweat to cool down. Sweat is a clear fluid that is released through the sweat glands in our skin, and it helps regulate our body temperature. Movement, exercising, and sex are all associated with physical activity, but they do not specifically relate to the act of sweating during exercise. Moist could be a possibility, but it is not as specific as sweat in this context.
The context of the sentence suggests that the setting of the amateur play is likely a school auditorium, as high schools often have theater programs and host plays. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of watching an amateur play in an auditorium.
An interstate highway is a type of highway system that runs across multiple states within the United States. Therefore, the correct answer is the United States of America. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they do not accurately describe what an interstate highway is or what it goes across.
The sentence mentions a specific geographic location, the base of the ancient longest wall. This is referring to the Great Wall of China, which is the longest wall in the world and located in China. The other options do not have any connection to the Great Wall or China.
The sentence suggests that the government made a decision to change a previous rule or practice. The word "allow" indicates that the government was giving permission or lifting a prohibition. The word "once" indicates that the government's decision represented a change from a prior state. The only option that fits this context is "permitted." The other options all suggest that the government was maintaining or reinstating a restriction.
The context of the question suggests that the answer refers to a feature found in a car. An LED (light-emitting diode) is commonly used in electronic displays, which are often found on a car's dashboard to show information such as speed and fuel levels. The other options, such as electronics and pc board, are too broad and do not narrow down the answer to a specific part of a car.
The sentence suggests that lawyers were doing something specific while they were growing up, which may indicate a characteristic or trait that is common among lawyers. Keeping quiet could be associated with confidentiality, which is an essential part of the legal profession. Lawyers need to keep their clients' information confidential and not disclose it to anyone else unless mandated by law. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "plate" in this context typically refers to a dish of food served at a restaurant or eatery. This is a common term used in the food service industry to describe meals that are served on a plate. The other options (kitchen cupboard, table, banquet, cabinet) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Bowling is a sport that involves rolling a ball down an alley in an attempt to knock down a set of pins at the end of the lane. A ball is typically used in this context, which is why the correct answer is likely to be a bowling alley. The other options, such as pool tables or playgrounds, do not typically involve the use of a ball to knock things down as the primary objective of the activity.
The context suggests that the question is exploring possible distractions that can occur when driving a car. Using a mobile phone is a commonly cited distraction that can take a driver's attention away from the road and increase the risk of automobile accidents. The other options are either outcomes of distractions (car crash and automobile accidents) or unrelated to the context (smoke and backache).
The sentence suggests that exceptional performances are being referenced, which is typically associated with a live show. While bands, operas, and ball events can all provide live shows, the word "performances" is a key word that highlights the relevance of the choice "show" over the others. The phrase "fine tune instruments" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as it does not fit the context of the sentence.
Schlitz is a beer that was originally brewed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is Milwaukee, as that is where the beer originates from. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Mexico is known for its beautiful beaches and is a popular tourist destination for this reason. Many people go to Mexico specifically to enjoy the beaches, which are often lined with resorts and other tourist attractions. The other options, such as zoo, waterfall, homes, or Disneyland, do not have the same level of popularity or association with Mexico's tourism industry.
The reference to the Mormon ownership of the steak house suggests a connection to the state of Utah, which has a sizable population of Mormons. Additionally, the fact that the steak house is always busy implies that it is located in a popular area, and Utah's reputation as a tourist destination makes it a likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Multiple closets are often found in apartment buildings because they are designed to accommodate the storage needs of multiple tenants. Individual apartments typically have several closets for storing clothes, linens, and other household items. Hotels may have closets in their rooms, but they usually only have one per room. Bedrooms and houses also have closets, but it is not specified whether they have multiple ones or not. Schools do not typically have closets unless they are used for storage purposes.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a container that one uses to drink out of. The other choices, choking, smoke, swallowing, and mouth, do not align with that context. Additionally, "glass" is a common material for drinking vessels, whereas the other options do not typically serve that purpose.
The sentence suggests that splitting up tasks into nearby blocks was a deliberate choice made by Joe, John, and Sylvia, implying that there was some practical benefit to doing so. The use of the word "efficiency" in the answer reflects this implication, as it suggests that dividing tasks in this manner allows for the completion of all tasks in a quicker and more streamlined manner. The other options (stress, aggravation, freed up time, net gain) do not seem to logically match with the idea of splitting up tasks into nearby blocks.
Chatting with friends implies exchanging ideas, opinions, and thoughts between two or more people. Communication is the act of exchanging information or messages through different channels such as speech, writing, or technology. Fun, happiness, and laughter can occur during communication, but they are not types of communication. Agreement refers to reaching a consensus, which is not necessarily the goal of chatting with friends.
Lying can break trust and damage the relationship between spouses, which is likely to result in unhappiness. While there may be exceptions to this, such as when the lie is told to protect the other person, the question does not provide any context that would suggest that this is the case. The other answer choices are not relevant to the question and do not provide any logical reason or context to support their selection.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to make new friends by interacting with people at the party. "Mix with people" means to engage or mingle with others, which is likely to lead to meeting new people and potentially making friends. "Find friends" implies that the person will search for existing friends, rather than making new ones. "Sing" and "see people" are not relevant to the goal of making new friends. Therefore, the correct answer is "mix with people."
The sentence mentions that Artie Shaw became famous playing the clarinet, which is an instrument commonly associated with jazz music. Jazz bands are typically made up of several musicians playing different instruments, including the clarinet, and are known for their improvisational style of playing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "kitchenette" suggests a small kitchen area, which is often found in apartments rather than houses or dorm rooms. The phrase "stacked on top of each other" implies that the dwelling type is a multi-story building like an apartment complex, and not a one-story apartment or a house. A hotel room may have a mini-fridge and a microwave, but these do not qualify as a kitchenette.
The sentence indicates that the meeting was specifically for business owners, suggesting that it was held in a location where multiple businesses are housed together. The term "committee" also suggests that this meeting was held internally among the business owners, rather than a meeting hosted by a city or government entity. The options town, government, and city hall do not fit the context of the sentence, while boardroom does not necessarily imply a meeting among business owners. Therefore, office building is the most fitting choice.
The sentence suggests that the family previously lived in the city where they didn't have a back yard, but now they do. This indicates that they likely moved to a more residential area. The options "farm" and "property" imply a larger land area than a typical residential property, making them less likely choices. "Neighborhood" and "yards" are also too generic and do not provide specific information about the family's living situation. Therefore, "suburb" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a residential area with houses and yards.
Parking structures are commonly utilized at places with high traffic and limited space, such as college campuses. College students often need a place to park their cars while attending classes and living on campus, making a parking structure a practical solution for managing the influx of vehicles. The other options may have parking structures, but they do not necessarily have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
Hanging clothes in the sun is a common method used to dry laundry quickly and naturally. Sunlight helps to evaporate moisture from the fabric, which is why it is often used as a laundry drying method. The other options do not make sense in this context - warming a room or a house would not be achieved by drying clothes outside, fading colors would be an unwanted result of exposure to sunlight, and promoting browning of skin implies sun tanning, which is not related to laundry.
The sentence suggests that the bus boy was cleaning up after dinner, and specifically mentions clearing the dishes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the bus boy was wiping the crumbs off the table. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the marker will be needed again in the near future at the same location. Keeping the marker in a pocket would allow for easy access and quick retrieval for future use. The other options do not provide the convenience and accessibility needed for the situation.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about transportation used by soldiers in combat or on the move. Carriages and tents are unlikely choices as they are not practical for military operations. Trenches are not a mode of transportation, but rather a form of defensive structure. The most practical mode of transportation for soldiers on the move or in combat situations is an armored car, which offers protection and mobility. The option "battlefield" is not a mode of transportation, but rather a place where soldiers engage in combat.
The sentence suggests that the impact of a bullet to the head is most likely fatal, resulting in sudden death. It is reasonable to assume that the other options are not relevant or likely outcomes of being shot in the head.
The sentence suggests that a person keeps their teddy bear in their own room, which is typically found in their home. The other options do not make sense in this context. A shelf may be in a home, but it does not necessarily indicate that a teddy bear is kept there. A gas station is not a logical place to keep a teddy bear. A toy store is where teddy bears are sold, not kept by individuals.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to acquire a chair to take home, which can be done by purchasing one from a furniture store. A furniture store is a retail business that sells furniture, such as chairs and other household items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a university, office, or church may not have chairs available for purchase, and going home would not provide a solution for acquiring a new chair.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a place to buy previously owned metal items. Hobby Lobby and instruments may sell metal items, but they are unlikely to sell used items. Ore is a type of raw material used to make metal, not a place to buy used metal items. Cars may contain metal parts, but they are not a place to specifically buy used metal items. A junkyard, on the other hand, is a common place to find previously owned and used metal items, making it the most likely correct answer.
Weddings are typically joyful events where people come together to celebrate the union and love between two people. The atmosphere is often filled with happiness, laughter, and positive emotions, which makes it a likely place for people to feel joyous. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Sean found his native English speaking ability helpful, implying that Ludwig did not have the same advantage. The word "foreigner" is the only option that directly relates to the idea of not being a native speaker of a language. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking where you would feel cramped in a cubicle, suggesting that a cubicle is a confined space. The other options do not relate to a confined workspace like a cubicle. "Work" is too general and could refer to any workspace, while "bank" and "office building" could have more spacious office layouts. "Constructing office space" is not a location where someone would feel cramped, but rather a job task. "Home office" may be a small workspace but it doesn't specifically mention a cubicle.
The sentence suggests that there is a type of breathing that can be harmful, which rules out the options "stay alive" and "continue to live" as they are not types of breathing. Hyperventilation is a known medical condition where a person breathes rapidly and shallowly, which can lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in the blood and cause symptoms such as dizziness, tingling, and chest pain. In contrast, "relaxation" and "panting" are not typically associated with any significant health risks.
The question suggests that malls are typically found in areas with large groups of people, and the choices include different types of areas. Downtown areas and large cities are often associated with bustling crowds and high population density, which make them likely places to find malls. Urban areas and suburbs are also densely populated and often have shopping centers. However, Montana is a rural state with a much lower population density, making it less likely to have a mall. Therefore, Montana is the correct answer.
The sentence implies that there is a festival happening in town, which typically involves outdoor activities, vendors, and food stalls. Among the options provided, "carnival" is the most likely choice as it commonly features lemonade and refreshments. The other options, such as "cabin" or "refrigerator," are unlikely to offer lemonade in the given context.
The word "fit in" implies a desire to belong or conform to a larger group. Out of the given choices, only society refers to a group of people with shared values, beliefs, and customs. The other choices, such as government and nature, do not necessarily involve a sense of belonging or conformity. The natural world and humanity are very broad categories that do not necessarily involve social interaction.
An eatery is a place where people go to eat, and a restaurant is a specific type of eatery where customers order food from a menu and have it served to them. The other options, such as commercial buildings, malls, and towns, could also have restaurants within them, but they are not necessarily the same as being in a restaurant specifically. The option "country" is also not appropriate for this question, as it refers to a geographic location rather than a type of establishment.
Visiting a museum is often associated with experiencing wonder or amazement at the works of art or exhibits on display. The other options don't align with common experiences people have when visiting a museum, such as being bored or having sore feet. Live shows may be part of a museum's programming, but it doesn't capture the overall experience of visiting a museum. Retrospection is not necessarily a reason people go to museums, but rather a possible outcome of reflecting on what they have seen.
The word "conflicts" suggests a disagreement or argument between people, which often leads to negative emotions such as anger. "Party" and "believe in god" are not necessarily related to conflicts, while "agree or disagree" is an action that may or may not lead to anger. "Gain weight" does not make sense in this context.
The sentence states that living life involves both good and bad experiences, and suggests that we should do something with them. "Learning" is the most logical option, as it implies that we can gain knowledge or wisdom from our experiences, both positive and negative, and use that knowledge to improve ourselves or our situations in the future. The other options - making love, getting married, having children, and repeating - do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a place where all creatures live, which suggests a broad and inclusive location. The world is a logical answer because it encompasses all living creatures across different environments such as oceans, forests, and deserts. The other options do not satisfy this requirement: zoos only contain a limited number of species in captivity, dark places like caves and underground tunnels may not support all types of creatures, lakes only support aquatic life, and woods may not have all species in significant numbers.
A library is a place where multiple people can access and use resources, such as books or newspapers. It is common for libraries to have only one telephone book that patrons can use, as it is not necessary for each individual to have their own copy. The other options, such as a desk or bedroom, are usually private spaces that are not intended for public use. Similarly, while a hotel may have a telephone book, it is not typically available for general use by guests.
Comforters are often used on beds for added warmth and comfort during sleep. Therefore, it would make sense for someone to store their comforter in the same room where they sleep, which is typically the bedroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Sarah left her purse at home and as a result, she couldn't wear the clothes she wanted. The logical conclusion would be for her to drive back home to retrieve her purse. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence provides information about Billy's personality, stating that he is a "big-hearted person" who wants to understand people better. This suggests that Billy is empathetic and compassionate towards others, which would be the reason he wants to understand them better. The other options do not necessarily relate to understanding people better from an emotional standpoint.
The sentence suggests that the teacher has some sort of role in relation to the student over the course of a semester. The correct answer can be inferred from the phrase "what does a teacher do for a student," which implies that the teacher has a supportive role. The other options don't fit this context as well, as preparing dinner or working in school are not typically teacher responsibilities, including examples might be a part of helping a student, and evaluating progress is only one aspect of the teacher's overall role.
Compost is usually made by combining organic materials such as food scraps and yard waste and allowing them to decompose over time. This process occurs naturally on the surface of the earth, where microorganisms break down the material and turn it into nutrient-rich soil. Compost is typically used in gardens and other outdoor spaces to improve soil quality and promote healthy plant growth. The other options do not make sense in the context of composting.
The sentence suggests that the metal being described is of high value or quality, which is commonly associated with precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. The other options do not convey a sense of value or quality and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence implies that there is something specific that adults can do in the morning that young children cannot. Since drinking beer is an activity that is restricted to those who are of legal drinking age, and children are not of legal drinking age, it is the most likely answer. The other options do not contain something that specifically distinguishes adults from young children in the morning.
The sentence implies that there is something that motivates people to play well in fencing, and the most likely option is competition. Fencing is a competitive sport, and athletes who participate in it may be motivated by the desire to win or to perform well in front of others. The other options, such as judge, perspiration, injury, and severe injuries, do not fit the context of the sentence or are not things that typically motivate fencers.
The phrase "going to market" often refers to selling something, which in this case, is a house. The word "bankruptcy" suggests that the owner may be forced to sell the house to pay off debts. The other options do not provide a clear reason for the house to be sold.
The context of the sentence suggests that the people are in agreement or harmony with each other. "Accord" means to agree or be in harmony, while "rapport" refers to a positive relationship or understanding between people. "Smiles" could also suggest agreement, but it is not as specific as "accord" or "rapport." "Dissonance" means lack of harmony or agreement, and "band together" suggests uniting for a common cause rather than agreeing with each other.
Popcorn is a common snack to eat while watching a movie, so the context suggests that the correct answer is the movie theater. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is skilled with a harmonica, which is commonly used in blues music. Blues music often features solos played on the harmonica, and the genre has a long history of famous harmonica players. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the library is restricted to only friends, which implies a personal or private setting. College, hotel, school, and downtown are all public places where anyone can go, so they are less likely to have a restricted-access library. A house, on the other hand, can be a private residence where only friends are allowed, making it a more plausible location for a library that only friends can visit.
The sentence suggests that the person got tickets to a performance of their idol, indicating that they have a great deal of respect and admiration for this person. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - experience, statue, applaud, and make reservations do not convey the same level of excitement or emotion as admiration.
The context of the sentence suggests that not using a towel after getting wet could lead to a physical reaction in the body. Shivering is a natural response to feeling cold, and if the body is wet and not dried off, it may feel cold and shiver in an attempt to warm up. The other options, such as shrinkage or getting melted, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions snare drum players and a sports game, which suggests a connection to marching band. Marching band is often seen performing at sporting events, and snare drum is a common instrument used in marching band performances. The other options, such as high school band or orchestra, do not necessarily have a connection to sports games or snare drum playing.
The sentence suggests that a poet who is telling stories about exotic locations has to use words to create images in the reader's mind. This is a common technique used in poetry, where the poet uses descriptive language to create a vivid picture of a scene or location. The other options may also be used in poetry, but they are not specifically related to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where a public call can be made, which suggests that it is not in a private location. A phone booth is a public space that is specifically designed for making phone calls, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to public phone calls. A clothing store, workplace, swimming pool, or phone mount are all locations where a phone call could be made, but they are not necessarily public.
The sentence suggests that the cat is an indoor-only pet, which implies that it stays inside a residence of some sort. The other options do not make sense in this context - a front door is not a place to stay, a zoo is not a suitable environment for a house cat, and a jail cell is a completely inappropriate location. "Floor" is too general and could apply to any indoor space.
A clockmaker is someone who repairs and maintains clocks. Therefore, it would make sense to bring a clock to a clockmaker when it stops working or needs repair. The other choices are not directly related to the purpose of a clockmaker. Storing a clock is a responsibility of the owner, timing an event can be done by any functioning clock, telling time can be done by any clock or watch, and winding down a clock is a routine maintenance task that can be done by the owner.
The sentence suggests that the person was a respected individual who cared for the environment and gave back to the community. Being memorialized on a bench is often associated with being remembered in a peaceful and tranquil setting, such as a garden. Rest areas, bus depots, and banks are not typically associated with memorials, while state parks could be a possible answer, but a garden is more likely given the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the view of stars through a window is not something that occurs commonly or easily. The phrase "out the window" implies a view from above, which suggests that the context is related to flying or being in space. The option "space shuttle" is the most closely related to this context, while the other options do not make sense in this scenario.
The sentence suggests that talking to oneself is a behavior that may lead others to think a person is crazy. This is because talking to oneself is often associated with mental illness or instability. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is unhappy with the plain landscape of their new home, which could indicate a preference for a different type of geography. The word "miss" also implies that the person had experienced a different type of geography before. Of the options, "mountain" is a type of geography that is often associated with grandeur and beauty, which may explain why the person misses it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A drunkard is someone who drinks excessively and often to the point of being unable to control their behavior. A teetotaler, on the other hand, is someone who abstains from alcohol completely. Therefore, a drunkard is not someone who is a teetotaler. The other choices, such as pioneer and temperance, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A moistener is typically used to moisten stamps or envelopes. Therefore, it makes sense for someone to keep a moistener in a place where they would commonly use stamps or envelopes; such as their desk drawer. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not typically associated with the use of moisteners.
The sentence refers to people kicking a ball, which is a common activity in soccer. Fans typically watch soccer games at stadiums or other sporting venues. The other options may involve sports that also have balls, but they do not necessarily involve kicking the ball.
The sentence implies that Brenda made a considerable effort to clean herself, which suggests that she disliked being dirty or unclean. The options "get messy," "cleaning," and "get dirty" are not correct because these actions are not being complained about. The only remaining option is "getting dirty," but this is in present tense which doesn't match the past tense of the sentence. Therefore, "being dirty" is the only logical choice.
The sentence suggests that the lizard is trying to avoid the heat, which means it is likely looking for a cooler location. The options "sunny place" and "rocky areas" are both associated with heat and exposure to sunlight, so they are unlikely to be the correct answers. "Garden" and "dirt" do not provide any specific information that would suggest they are better locations for the lizard to rest. "Shady spot" is the most likely answer because it provides a cooler and more comfortable location for the lizard to rest.
The sentence suggests that the person was tired from standing all day and decided to take a break. The option "sitting down" is the most logical choice as it directly relates to taking a break after standing for a long period of time. The other options may also refer to taking a break, but do not specifically address the act of sitting down on a bench.
The context of the sentence suggests that the children were engaging in some sort of physical activity in an outdoor location. The phrase "play ball" is often associated with outdoor sports such as baseball or soccer, which would be a likely activity for children to participate in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Mountains are commonly associated with activities such as climbing or hiking. However, these activities can be dangerous or impossible to do if the weather is not good. Mountain climbing requires clear visibility and stable ground conditions, and bad weather like rain or snow can make it difficult to climb safely. The other options (travel, go somewhere, ride bike, play frisbee) are more general and do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence refers to those who are flying in an airplane, which typically refers to individuals who are traveling from one destination to another. The term commonly used to describe these individuals is "passengers." The other choices are not accurate descriptions of individuals who are flying in an airplane.
The sentence suggests that the citizens are complaining about the condition of a roadway, which is something that falls under the responsibility of a city government. Neighborhoods and subdivisions may have their own local authorities, but they would not have the authority or resources to address major road repairs. The governor may have some influence over state-funded roadway projects, but this is unlikely to be the first point of contact for citizens with complaints about local infrastructure. The countryside is too broad a term to have any relevance to this sentence.
The question is asking what using a computer may not cause for someone who is paralyzed, which implies that the answer is related to the limitations that paralysis imposes on the use of a computer. Paralysis typically affects the movement and control of the body, which can make it difficult to type, move the mouse, or use other computer peripherals. Therefore, options like carpal tunnel syndrome, medical bill, and eye strain may still be potential issues for someone who is paralyzed and uses a computer. In contrast, increased efficiency is also unlikely to be a factor, as someone who is paralyzed may not be able to work at the same pace as someone who has full use of their limbs. Therefore, pleasure is the most logical option, as someone who is paralyzed may not be able to derive enjoyment from using a computer in the same way as someone who is not.
The sentence implies that the act of paying for someone to swallow semen is a transactional or commercial one. This is a common practice in the sex industry, especially with prostitutes who may offer additional services for an extra fee. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve the exchange of money or sexual services.
The question implies that the person has finished their work, but it is not yet dark outside. This suggests that there is still some time left in the day, and it would not be appropriate to go to sleep. Rest and relaxing are similar, but rest usually implies some physical recovery while relax implies reducing stress or tension. Getting paid is not a typical response to finishing work, and the sentence doesn't mention anything about payment. Finally, the option "have fun" may be a good choice, but it is not specific enough to the situation mentioned in the question. The best answer would be to relax, as it is a common choice for when someone finishes work and wants to unwind before the end of the day.
The sentence implies that the yoyo was stolen by a bratty young person, which suggests that it may have been taken by someone who had access to the yoyo and knew that it was valuable or desirable. The options "toy store," "toy shop," and "toy factory" are unlikely to have the stolen yoyo because they are not associated with the context of the sentence. "Own home" is also unlikely because the sentence suggests that the yoyo was stolen, which means it is not in the possession of the person who owns it. "Brother's room" is the most likely option because the bratty young person may have been a sibling or someone who had access to the owner's room.
The sentence suggests that while the person's passion was to open a business, they also had a desire to become wealthy. This is supported by the use of the phrase "he'd be lying if he didn't," indicating that the desire for wealth is something the person is not admitting openly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either have a negative connotation (bankruptcy) or are too broad (live the dream, busy).
The sentence suggests that the person dislikes having meetings while eating because he doesn't want to hear someone eat, which implies that the noise of drinking is also unwanted. It is therefore logical to assume that the correct answer is "drinking." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the teacher got all the children involved, which suggests a learning environment. The fact that they "learned together" also supports this idea of a group learning experience. The other options do not fit with the idea of a teacher getting children involved in a classroom setting.
A round glass is typically used for holding liquids, such as water or other beverages. The other options do not make sense in the context of a glass, as glassware is not typically associated with breaking easily, having many different colors, shattering, or holding doughnuts.
A ticket booth is a place where you buy tickets for events or transportation. Typically, the person who sells you the ticket is called the "clerk." The other options (venue, movie theater, museum, train station) all refer to locations where you might find a ticket booth, but the person you give money to would still be the clerk.
A train station is a common mode of transportation for getting to a town. Michigan is a state, not a mode of transportation or a destination. Countryside, squirrel, and valley are not relevant options for getting to a town.
Churches often have candles as part of their religious rituals, particularly in the Christian faith. The use of candles is symbolic and can represent the presence of God, enlightenment, or remembrance of those who have passed away. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the absence of evergreens in woods is related to a specific activity, which is cutting trees for deer. Evergreens are a type of tree that can provide year-round food and cover for wildlife, so it's unlikely that they would be absent from undisturbed natural areas like tracts of undeveloped land or rural areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the people were struggling to see which parts of the wall needed a second coat of paint because they did not have enough light. Therefore, it makes sense that they would plug in another light source to provide additional illumination. A lamp is a common household item used for lighting, so it is a likely choice in this context. The other options do not make sense in the given situation.
The sentence implies that the speaker is using a hairpin on a female customer, which suggests that the hairpin is intended for use in styling or securing the customer's hair. The options "hair salon" and "barber shop" suggest places where one might use a hairpin, while "bathroom cabinet drawer" and "forehead" are unlikely locations for using a hairpin on someone else's hair.  Therefore, the correct answer is "woman's hair."
The question is asking about a location where pictures are kept with magnets. The use of magnets suggests a surface that is metal or magnetic, such as a fridge. The other options (bedroom wall, newspaper, suitcase, attic) do not have a clear association with magnets or places where pictures are commonly kept with magnets.
The sentence mentions a frozen pond near train tracks, which is a common sight in rural areas or the countryside. Additionally, playing hockey on frozen ponds is a popular pastime in Canada, which is known for its cold winters. Michigan and Alaska also have colder climates, but the sentence does not provide any specific information linking them to the activity described. The train station is mentioned only as a nearby landmark and is not directly related to the activity.
The word "disposable" suggests that the razor is intended to be thrown away after a single use, which means it would likely end up in the garbage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Supermarkets and hotel rooms have no clear connection to disposable razors, while a closet or medicine cabinet are not likely places for disposing of them.
The sentence suggests that the farmer wants to increase his productivity, which is commonly associated with agriculture. Farmers grow crops to sell them or to use them to feed livestock, and the more crops they have, the more work they can get done. Planting cows and watering plants are not viable options as cows are animals that cannot be planted, and watering plants does not necessarily relate to productivity. Canning produce is a form of preservation and does not contribute to increasing the amount of work done. Rising early may be a good habit, but it alone will not necessarily lead to increased productivity in farming.
The sentence suggests that the meal being referred to contains carrots and leafy vegetables. While soup may contain some of these ingredients, salad is a more likely option since it is known for being composed of various leafy vegetables and often includes carrots as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the jellyfish was being moved by something in the water, and the word "pushed" indicates a force pushing the jellyfish. The most probable option is "current," as currents in the water can easily move jellyfishes along. The other options like "store," "book," "park," and "lake" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person is in need of financial assistance. Giving something or feeling sorry may not necessarily solve the problem, while crossing the street is irrelevant. Trusting God may be a personal belief but does not provide practical assistance. Lending money may be a possible solution to help the person get back on their feet, but this decision should be made after careful consideration of both parties' abilities to repay the loan.
Toilet paper is commonly used in bathrooms for personal hygiene purposes, and is usually stored in a specific location within the bathroom, such as a toilet paper holder, shelf, or cabinet. The other options do not fit the context of the question and are unlikely places to find toilet paper in a house.
Roosters are necessary for hens to lay fertilized eggs, which can then hatch into chicks. If there is no rooster present, the hens will still lay unfertilized eggs, but they will not produce new chicks. Therefore, the presence of a rooster is important for sustained egg production. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical answer.
Going on vacation is often associated with taking a break from the routine of everyday life and engaging in enjoyable activities. While some people may experience stress while planning or travelling, "panic" and "debt" are generally not the main goals of a vacation. "Debate" may be applicable if a group is trying to decide on activities, but it is not a common goal of most individuals going on vacation. "Peace" may be a desirable outcome, but it does not necessarily capture the primary intention of going on vacation.
A grocery store typically carries a variety of items, including frozen foods and party supplies, making it the most likely option for purchasing both in one stop. The other options, such as the refrigerator and freezer, are specific appliances for storing food rather than places to purchase them. The terms "fridge" and "supermarket" are sometimes used interchangeably with "grocery store," but they do not provide any extra information that would suggest they are better choices for purchasing frozen food and party supplies together.
Intense competitions can create a sense of pressure and anxiety, which can lead to tension among the participants and the crowd. Tension refers to a feeling of being stretched tight, and it is often associated with emotional or psychological strain. Arguments and enemies are not necessarily related to competition, while sore muscles may be a physical sensation experienced by the participants, but not the crowd. Stress is a general term that may apply to any situation, so it does not indicate a specific aspect of the competition.
The sentence mentions the women walking up and down a catwalk, which is a common feature of a fashion show. The cameras flashing also suggest that it is a public event where people are taking photos. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a dangerous outdoor activity for children. Sunning oneself can be dangerous for children because they may not be aware of the dangers of UV radiation from the sun, which can lead to skin cancer later in life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not typically associated with being dangerous outdoor activities for children.
The sentence suggests that the person has a talent for making stories more dramatic than they seem at first, which is a characteristic commonly associated with hyperbole - an exaggerated form of speech or writing. The other options do not convey the same sense of exaggeration or enhancement that hyperbole does.
A courtyard is typically an outdoor area surrounded by buildings, often found in residential or institutional settings. The options "three headed dragon named Ralph," "asshole," and "Spain" do not have any clear connection to a courtyard. However, a lawn is a common feature in courtyards, making it a likely choice for the answer. Additionally, Versailles is a famous palace in France with extensive gardens and courtyards, making it an appropriate choice for the answer.
The sentence suggests that the man is tired and sore, and has decided to stay in bed. The most logical reason for this is to rest and give his body time to recover. The choice "lazy" does not fit the context of the sentence, as the man is described as being tired and sore rather than simply choosing not to do anything. The choices "were sick," "to be sick," and "you're sick" all use improper grammar and are not suitable options.
The question suggests that the son has finished eating and needs to put away his paper plate. The most logical place for him to put it would be on a table, which is a common surface for eating and clearing dishes. The other options (his bedroom, dishwasher, cabinet, restaurant) do not make sense in the context of the question because they are not places where dishes are typically put after eating.
Beavers are typically found in natural aquatic habitats, such as rivers, streams, and lakes, which are commonly found in rural and wilderness areas like the countryside. While it is possible for beavers to be found in a zoo, the context of the question suggests that it is asking about where beavers can be found in the wild. The other options (middle of road, dictionary) are not suitable habitats for beavers. British Columbia may be a possible answer, but it is not clear whether the question is asking for a specific location or a general type of environment.
The question is asking for a place where a piece of furniture can serve a dual purpose – as both a seating option and a bed. The living room is a common area where people entertain guests and need extra seating, so having a sofa bed in the living room would be a practical choice. The other options (garage, spare room, dining room) do not typically serve as primary living spaces where people would need both seating and a bed.
A public amphitheatre is a type of outdoor venue typically used for concerts, plays, and other performances. In a city, it is common to find public amphitheatres in parks, as they provide an ideal setting for outdoor events. Movie houses are indoor venues used for showing films, while Greece and Italy are countries known for their ancient amphitheatres but may not have public ones in a city. "Outside" is too general to be a correct answer.
The word "exhaustion" suggests that the pregnant woman is experiencing fatigue or tiredness, and therefore needs to rest. The option "run out of steam" is a colloquial phrase that is not a medical treatment, while "give birth" is not a likely treatment for exhaustion. "Sit down" is too general and does not convey the necessary level of rest that the woman needs, and "stay in bed" is a more specific and appropriate treatment for exhaustion during pregnancy. However, it may depend on the severity of the exhaustion and the advice of a healthcare professional.
The context of the sentence suggests that eating breakfast with specific food can prevent a certain condition, which is likely related to digestion since it is contrasted with "dirty dishes" and "being satisfied." Indigestion is a common digestive issue that can be caused by various factors including the types of food we eat. Therefore, it makes sense that someone could try to prevent indigestion by eating specific food for breakfast. The other options do not have a clear connection to preventing a digestive issue.
Box offices are generally located in areas where there are many performing venues, such as theaters and concert halls. The term "theater district" specifically refers to an area within a city that has many theaters and other performing arts venues, typically where Broadway shows are performed. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence or the presence of box offices.
A frying pan is typically purchased at a department store, specifically in the cookware section. It is not something typically found in homes or storage areas like cupboards or cabinets. The stove is where you would use a frying pan, but not where you would obtain one.
The sentence suggests that there is a process that needs to be completed prior to beginning work, which is commonly applying for a job. Applying oneself or concentrating can be a personal preference or attribute, but they do not relate to the context of starting work. Showering and shaving may be necessary steps in personal grooming, but they are not essential tasks to begin work.
Garbage is brought to landfills by garbagemen. Landfills are designated areas where waste is disposed of and buried underground. Trashcans and dumpsters are containers used to temporarily hold garbage until it is picked up by garbagemen. Television and computer have no connection to the disposal of garbage.
The sentence suggests that the judge is presiding over a court case and needs to listen to testimony from individuals who are involved in the case. "Appear in court" is a common phrase used to describe being present for a court case, whether as a witness or defendant. "Go into court" and "in the jury" both suggest being inside the courtroom but do not necessarily imply giving testimony. "Go to church" and "believe" have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the faithful are engaging in an act of communication during their prayer, which is commonly associated with talking to god. Kneeling down may be a physical posture associated with prayer, but it does not necessarily imply communication with a deity. "Knell" is an uncommon verb that does not fit the context of the sentence, and "ask for help" is a possible motivation for prayer but does not describe the act itself. Therefore, "talking to god" is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that the children were in a rush to leave for school after eating breakfast. Since they left something behind, it is reasonable to assume that it was something related to their breakfast, such as dirty dishes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man was happy with his job, despite his appearance and the nature of his duties. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a positive emotion or feeling that is associated with job satisfaction. French fries and hamburgers are both types of fast food, but they do not necessarily indicate any emotional state. Enjoyment would be a possible answer, but there is no clear indication that the man enjoyed his job for any reason other than getting to eat hamburgers. Nausea and gas are both negative physical reactions that are unlikely to be associated with job satisfaction.
The sentence suggests that the person was trying to understand and solve a mathematical formula, and as they figured it out, they filled out something. Since the person was trying to think deeply about the formula, it is likely that the "something" they filled out were answers or solutions. The other options do not make sense in the given context - becoming distracted or wondering would not lead to filling out anything.
The mom is instructing her son to stay in bed, which would imply that he needs more rest. Therefore, the likely option is "more rest." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence particularly well - "rest more" is very similar to "more rest," but sounds slightly awkward and repetitive, while "you're sick" and "drink water" introduce new ideas that are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person mentioned has not been paying their bills, which can lead to bad credit. Credit refers to a person's ability to borrow money or obtain goods or services on credit, and a bad credit score can make it difficult to get a loan or credit card approvals in the future. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a water spout that is impressive and is located at the center of something. Fountains are commonly known to have water spouts at their center and are often designed to be visually impressive, especially in larger public spaces or tourist attractions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the old stuff could have value, which implies that it may be worth preserving or exhibiting. Museums are institutions that collect and display objects of historical, cultural, or artistic significance, and are often the best places to send valuable items for appraisal and potential display. The other options do not offer any obvious connection to preserving or exhibiting valuable objects.
The question is asking for a reason for continuing to smoke despite warnings, which suggests that the person is already aware of the risks and dangers associated with smoking. Therefore, the most likely reason would be addiction to cigarettes. The other options are inappropriate and insensitive, and do not provide a valid reason for continuing to smoke.
Marmots are typically found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in mountainous regions of North America and Eurasia. The other answer choices are unlikely to be correct, as marmots do not typically live in the southern hemisphere or in jungles, and Vancouver Island is not specifically known for its marmot populations.
The sentence suggests that the children were engaged in some kind of activity with educational materials. The option "having fun" is the most likely answer because it is common for children to engage in play as a way of learning and exploring their environment. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they do not relate to the idea of using educational materials.
The word "ocean" suggests that the question is related to larger bodies of water, and "cargo ships" may imply commercial or industrial activities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "cross ocean," as it is a common function of ships that are not specifically designed for carrying cargo. "Bottoming out" suggests running aground, which is unlikely for ships that are not designed for shallow waters. "Collide" is a negative outcome that is not necessarily specific to ships that are not cargo ships, and is not a common function. "Crossing a river" is unlikely for ships that are designed for the open ocean. "Carrying people" is a possibility, but not specific to ships that are not cargo ships.
Inflation is the increase in prices of goods and services over time. One tool for fighting inflation is deflation, which is the decrease in prices of goods and services over time. Deflation can help alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing the purchasing power of consumers, which can lead to increased demand for goods and services and ultimately lower prices. The other options do not relate to tools for fighting inflation.
Each of the options listed are institutions or locations where adults can go to further their education and gain new knowledge. Depending on their specific interests and goals, an adult may choose to enroll in a college class or university program, visit a library to read and research, attend a school or classroom setting to gain hands-on experience, or pursue any combination of these options to achieve their desired level of learning.
The question suggests that the answer relates to a place with very little human population, regardless of whether it is raining or not. The arctic is a sparsely populated region with extreme weather conditions, which would likely prevent people from living there. Seattle is a city with a relatively high population, while Disneyland is a popular tourist destination, both of which would have a significant number of people. The forest and weather options are too broad and do not provide enough context to determine whether they would have a low human population.
The sentence suggests that Joe placed the back of the painting against something (presumably a wall), meaning that the front of the painting would be visible. By definition, the front of a painting is referred to as the "forward" side. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the specific time when Christmas occurs in Argentina. The answer "when correct time comes" suggests that there is no specific date given, but rather the holiday occurs on the traditional date that it always does (December 25th). The other options do not relate to the question of when Christmas occurs in Argentina.
The sentence suggests that the mammoth being referred to is not real, which implies that it is a replica or a model of the animal. The most likely place to find such a model would be a museum of natural history, where they often have exhibits and displays of prehistoric animals. The other options relate to specific time periods or genres and do not necessarily imply the presence of models or replicas.
The word "churchyard" typically refers to a graveyard or burial ground surrounding a church, which is a common feature in English towns and villages. While churches and graveyards can be found in various locations, the use of the word "very famous" suggests that the location should be widely known and significant, which is often the case with historic English churches and churchyards. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Smoking is a well-known risk factor for a variety of health problems, including heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and stroke. Therefore, the choices that mention specific health problems are more likely to be correct. The option "pleasure" is incorrect because while smoking may provide a temporary feeling of pleasure or relaxation, it ultimately leads to negative health consequences.
The sentence suggests that the location for the light source should be within the home and specifically in a place where someone may trip. The most logical option is the hallway, which is a common pathway in a home and often has limited natural light sources. The other options, such as the street or sky, are located outside and not relevant to the context of the sentence. Flashlight and books could be a source of light, but not necessarily in the context of moving through one's home.
The word "conquer" suggests a sense of competition or battle, where one side must emerge victorious over the other. The option "win" directly relates to this idea of beating one's opponent and is the most logical choice. "Make fun of" is not a suitable option as it is not a strategy for defeating an opponent, and "best" and "compete" do not convey the same level of intensity as the word "conquer." "Total domination" is a possible option but is less commonly used and may not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the man was dissatisfied with the materialistic and consumerist aspects of secular life, indicating a desire for a simpler and more spiritual existence. This aligns with the concept of monastic life, which often involves living in a community and devoting oneself to prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices while eschewing material possessions and worldly pursuits. The other options do not fit as neatly with the context of the sentence, such as "eternal," which is too abstract and unspecific, and "married life," which implies a different kind of lifestyle altogether.
Marmosets are small primates that are native to the rainforest regions of South America. They are adapted to living in warm and humid environments and cannot tolerate cold temperatures. Snow and mountains are associated with cold weather, and Colorado is a state known for its snowy winters. France does not have a particular association with either cold or warm weather, and therefore cannot be definitively eliminated as a possible answer. However, the rainforest is the natural habitat of marmosets, so it is unlikely that they would find it too cold to live there.
The sentence suggests that people struggle with something specific while at a shop. The option "compare prices" is the most likely answer as it is a common difficulty people have while shopping, especially if they are looking to save money or find the best deal. "Spending money" and "purchasing" are not necessarily difficult but may be related to financial constraints. "Gambling" and "having fun" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that knitting can cause some sort of illness or condition in the hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects the joints, including those in the hands, and can be caused or worsened by repetitive movements such as those involved in knitting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "have fun" and "relaxation" seem especially unlikely given that the sentence is discussing a potential negative outcome of the activity. "Shredded hands" may seem plausible given that knitting can be tough on the skin of the fingertips, but it is not a recognized medical condition.
The question is asking about the reason for cooking dinner, and being hungry is a common reason for preparing a meal. The other options may also be true, but they do not provide a direct answer to the question.
In many cultures and traditions, wings are used as a symbol of transition or transformation, often representing a journey from one state to another. In this context, the most likely answer is heaven, which is often associated with the afterlife and a transition from mortal life to eternity. The other options, such as airplane, flapping, pilot, and Detroit, do not have any clear connection to this symbolic meaning of wings.
The sentence suggests a family relationship where "he" is the uncle and "she" is his relative. The correct answer is the option that represents the female relative of an uncle, which is a niece. The other options are either not related to the context of the sentence or do not fit the family relationship described.
An orchard is a place where trees are grown specifically for their fruit or nut production, whereas the other options do not necessarily have any association with providing food. A yard may have trees that bear fruit or nuts, but it is not their primary purpose, and not all yards have fruit trees. A state park may have trees that produce food, but it is not their primary purpose and they may not be accessible for harvesting. A market is a place to buy food, not grow it. The surface of the earth refers to the entire planet and has no specific association with trees that provide food.
The sentence indicates that the food needs to be kept chilled but there is no refrigerator. The pantry is a common place to store non-refrigerated food items in the kitchen. The other options do not have any connection to the context and are unlikely places to store food, especially without a refrigerator.
The phrase "wee hours" is commonly associated with staying up late or working through the night, which suggests that John was working at a desk in his workspace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that washing hands for a long time is done for a specific purpose. Using soap and cleaning dirt off are both common reasons for washing hands for an extended period of time. Thinking and sleeping do not make sense in this context and irritation does not necessarily require a long period of hand washing.
Foxes are known to be wild animals that inhabit wooded areas, as they provide cover and shelter for hunting and denning. Hen houses and chicken coops are places where foxes may attempt to prey on domesticated chickens, but they are not where foxes would typically be found in the wild. Paintings and electrical circuits have no relevance to the habitat of a fox.
Bowling alleys often provide scorecards and pencils for players to keep track of their scores throughout a game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of using pencils to keep score.
The sentence suggests that the person is inspecting a type of housing that has a ceiling, which is commonly associated with lofts. Lofts are often converted spaces that were originally used for industrial or commercial purposes, and can have unique design features such as high ceilings that are worth inspecting. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the gentleman referred to is not a real person, which implies that they may be a fictional character. The most likely place to see a fictional character that appears to be a gentleman is on a TV screen, since TV shows and movies often depict fictional characters in various roles. Church and big house both refer to physical locations that are unlikely to contain a non-real gentleman. The option tuxedo refers to an article of clothing, which is not a suitable answer to the question.
Phone books typically contain listings of people's names and their contact information, such as their phone number and address. If the goal is to find out how to contact a person with a certain name, a phone book would likely be the most helpful resource to consult. The other options may be useful in certain contexts but do not specifically relate to finding contact information for a person.
The sentence suggests that getting drunk can lead to something negative when people have disagreements. While any of the answer choices may be negative on their own, the phrase "when people have disagreements" hints at a specific outcome. Research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the likelihood of aggression and violent behavior, especially in the context of interpersonal conflicts. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "violence." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are less commonly associated with the effects of alcohol consumption.
In order to watch a film, one must have their eyes open to be able to see the images on the screen. The other options do not directly relate to the act of watching a film, for example, going to movies is an action taken to watch a film, but it does not describe what one must do on their face. Similarly, wearing glasses, having eyes, or relaxing may facilitate one's ability to watch a film, but they are not necessary actions to perform in order to watch a film.
The sentence suggests that the person is investing time in acquiring information about math equations. This implies that their primary objective is to seek knowledge about the subject matter, rather than to find a specific solution to a problem or to learn how to use the equations practically. Therefore, the correct answer would be "gaining knowledge". The other answer choices are either too narrow in scope or do not fit the context of the sentence.
Prescription mouthwash is a medical product that requires a prescription to purchase. It is typically designed to address specific oral health issues, such as gum disease or bad breath, and is only available through a healthcare provider. A dentist's office is the most likely option for obtaining prescription mouthwash, as dentists are trained to diagnose and treat oral health conditions. Optometrists deal with eye health, drug stores may sell over-the-counter mouthwash but not prescription varieties, and bathrooms and bottles are not suitable options for acquiring prescription mouthwash.
The sentence suggests that Sarah believed her party was a surprise, but in reality, it was not. The phrase "entirely what" indicates that the correct answer will describe the nature of the party. Therefore, the answer must indicate that the party was not a surprise. Bland, predictable, and boring all describe unenjoyable qualities of a party, which is not the focus of the sentence. "Send flowers" is not related at all to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to traveling with instruments, and the question is asking where the instruments are kept during such travel. The option "case" is the most logical because musical instruments are often transported in cases designed to protect them during travel. The other options do not have any clear connection to musical instruments or travel.
Canned goods are commonly stored in a pantry, which is a dedicated storage area for food items. A pantry typically has shelves for organizing canned goods, as well as other food items such as boxed items or dry goods. Cupboards, cabinets, drawers, and shelves can also be used for storing canned goods, but the best choice among the given options is pantry because it is specifically designed for food storage.
The context of the question suggests that it is related to a visit to Starbucks, a popular coffee shop. The handle of a coffee cup is commonly held by people after they receive their coffee order, while the other options do not make sense in this context. "Gripping" could be a possible option, but it still doesn't fit the specific context of Starbucks. A "briefcase" or "frying pan" are unlikely options, as they are not typically associated with a visit to a coffee shop. "Carry object" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer.
The use of the phrase "manager" suggests that Jenny might be in a workplace environment, such as an office. Additionally, the need to dial 9 to get an outside line is a common requirement in many office phone systems. The other options, such as hospital, friend's house, hotel, and every U.S, don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to the end of a war. The most likely outcome in a war is death, either through natural causes or from being killed in battle. Going to jail or receiving punishment may happen during the war, but it is not necessary for the war to end. Recognizing their true oppressors may be a desirable outcome, but it does not necessarily mean the war will end.
The sentence implies that the person has mixed feelings about pie: while they do not like it, it has a sentimental value to them because it reminds them of their wife. The word "cherish" means to hold dear or to treasure something, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A grandfather clock is a large, tall, freestanding clock typically kept in a home or personal living space. It is not typically found in a desk or office building, and while it could be displayed in an exhibition hall, it is more commonly seen in a personal bedroom or living area of a house.
A ring binder is a commonly used organizational tool for students, as it allows them to keep multiple sheets of paper in one place and separate them by subject or topic. Schools often require students to have ring binders as part of their school supplies. The other options, such as a notebook or bookstore, do not necessarily suggest that a student would have a ring binder. An office or office supply store may have ring binders, but it is not specific to students.
The sentence suggests that someone might feel a certain way after spending time learning about a subject they're passionate about. "Passionate" typically means having strong feelings, emotions, and enthusiasm towards something, so it's likely that the individual would feel positive about their learning experience. "Advance" and "gain knowledge" may also be correct as they could be seen as positive outcomes, but "headache" is unlikely and "form opinions" could be either positive or negative.
The mention of people with suitcases suggests that the location is likely a transportation hub. A ticket office at a hotel or opera house would not necessarily have people with suitcases. "End of line" could refer to a transportation hub, but without further context, it is too vague to be a likely answer. "City" is too broad of a category to infer any useful information. Therefore, the most likely answer is "train station."
Hotels often have bars and offer travel accommodations for guests, making them a good option for someone looking to travel and have access to bar service. The other options, such as trains or amusement parks, may not have bar service readily available or may not be as accommodating for travelers looking for bar service. A wedding or entertainment event may have a bar, but it may not necessarily involve travel or provide lodging accommodations.
The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating midday, and that consequence is feeling tired. This could be due to the body using energy to digest the food or because of a post-lunch dip in energy levels. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not match the known effects of eating midday.
The phrase "skyscrapers" refers to tall buildings, and New York City is known for having some of the most famous and iconic skyscrapers in the world, such as the Empire State Building and the One World Trade Center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the teacher is answering questions for a specific reason. The options "children will learn" and "teaching" are related to the profession of a teacher, but they do not explain why the teacher is answering questions in this particular situation. "Helping" is too vague, and could apply to any number of scenarios. "Embarrassment" is unlikely to be the reason why the teacher is answering questions. Therefore, the best option is "people will understand," as this aligns with the goal of effective communication and comprehension in an educational setting.
The sentence suggests that Jane is experiencing physical and emotional discomfort and is in need of rest. Relaxation is the most appropriate choice as it addresses both her physical and emotional needs. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence. Adventure may lead to physical exertion and further fatigue, headache is a symptom of discomfort, deciding is not a solution to Jane's problem, and revelations are unrelated to the sentence.
The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, but the word "restricted" means limited or confined. If someone can only eat certain things, it means their diet is restricted, or limited to certain foods. This is a common term used in discussions of nutrition and dietary needs, and it makes sense in the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that John is looking to satisfy his craving for carrots, which are commonly sold in supermarkets. The other options do not make sense in this situation - an attic or cellar would not typically have carrots, a farmer's market may not be open at 9 PM, and a refrigerator is typically found in one's own home, not a destination to drive to.
The question suggests that there is something that all people have, except for sociopaths. The word "except" implies that sociopaths lack this trait, while everyone else possesses it. The options "cheeks," "parents," "muscles," and "common sense" do not fit this pattern, as they are not traits that sociopaths are known to lack. However, sociopaths are often characterized as lacking or having difficulty understanding and experiencing emotions or feelings, so this is likely the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys walking during autumn and specifically mentions her appreciation for the color of fallen leaves. The most logical place for her to take long walks in September that would allow her to see the changing colors of leaves would be a forest or wooded area. The other options, such as a roof or tree, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker has negative feelings towards the King and his knights, but still holds them in high regard in some way. The choice "honor" would be the most fitting in this context because it implies that the speaker recognizes the importance or worthiness of the King and his knights, even if they do not necessarily like them. "Reverence," "admiration," and "respect" are also related to having positive or favorable feelings towards someone, which conflicts with the speaker's negative view in this sentence. "Kindness" does not fit the context of the sentence.
Condoms are a form of contraceptive used during sexual activity to prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections. Therefore, it is most appropriate to use condoms in the context of sexual encounters, which commonly occur in a bedroom setting. The other options do not relate to the context of condom use, and some are inappropriate or nonsensical (e.g. dick, supermarket).
The sentence suggests that the use of a machine gun is associated with a specific field or profession. The options "quake 2" and "arsenal" are video game and weapon-related terms, respectively, and are not relevant to the context of the sentence. "In a" is too vague and does not provide any meaningful information. "Armory" is a location where weapons are stored, but it does not necessarily indicate the use of machine guns. "Military service" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the use of weapons, including machine guns.
The sentence suggests that John's lunch was ruined, and he needs to get more. Going to the market would be the most logical option to obtain more food. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence.
A landscape gardener is someone who designs and creates outdoor spaces, including gardens and yards. Planting trees is a common activity for a landscape gardener, as they work to create a visually appealing and functional outdoor environment. Watering the lawn and plants is also important for maintaining the health and vibrancy of the outdoor space, but it is not necessarily a specific action that a landscape gardener is known for. Gardening roses is a specific type of activity that a gardener might engage in, but it is not necessarily what a landscape gardener is most commonly known for. Playing on the ground is not a task associated with any type of gardener.
The question refers to a common clothing item, trousers, and a specific part of it, the fly. The verb "unfastened" implies that the fly was previously closed, and therefore needs to be "fastened" or closed again. The options "do up," "tie up," and "button up" all suggest the use of buttons or ties to fasten the fly, but trousers typically have a zipper instead. Therefore, "zip up" is the correct answer. "Pick up" is not related to fastening clothing and doesn't make sense in this context.
The sentence mentions a car factory, and Detroit is famously known as "Motor City" due to its history as a major center for automobile manufacturing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the apple tree was located outside a car factory in Detroit. None of the other choices have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "learning about the world from a shut in" implies that the person has limited access to the outside world and is likely to have a unique perspective. This experience can lead to a greater understanding of the world, as they may have to rely on other sources of information and have more time for reflection. Confusion, cynicism, and sadness are possible outcomes, but they are not necessarily tied to the context of the question. Enlightenment is also a possibility, but it is more commonly associated with spiritual or philosophical experiences, rather than being shut in.
The sentence implies that the question is related to the storage of food cans, which are typically stored in a household setting. While some people may store cans in a pantry or cupboard, the most common place to store cans is in a refrigerator. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as supermarkets are primarily for purchasing food, recycling centers are for disposing of waste, and backpacks are not typically used for storing food cans.
The description of the location contains several clues that suggest Joe works in a warehouse, such as the "stacks of small cardboard boxes" and the fact that the lids are removable, indicating that the contents are being stored and moved around. Additionally, warehouses are commonly associated with storage and sorting of goods, which matches the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit with the description provided.
Weddings are typically celebrated with a large crowd of people, made up of family, friends, and acquaintances of the couple. The other options do not typically involve large gatherings of people for the purpose of celebration. A bus stop is a place where people wait for transportation, a crowd is not a specific event, a convention is a professional gathering, and a supermarket is a place where people shop for groceries.
The sentence implies that the politician's primary motive is not to actually fulfill their promises, but rather to gain power. The other choices may be related to the politician's goal in some way, but none of them capture the essence of what it means to make empty promises during a campaign. Power is often seen as the ultimate goal of many politicians, and this choice fits with the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person finished using the toilet and then did something to it before leaving. The only logical option in this case is to flush the toilet, which is a common and necessary practice after using the restroom. The other options do not make sense in this context - "flushed" is in the past tense and the sentence is in the present tense, "refill" and "clear" do not fit with what someone would do in a bathroom and "smell bad" is not an action that anyone would take.
Playing fetch with a dog typically involves throwing an object, such as a ball or a frisbee, and having the dog retrieve it and return it to the human. This activity could be considered a game because it involves rules, competition, and an element of fun. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of playing fetch with a small dog.
Remembering a deceased friend can often inspire people to live their lives to the fullest and appreciate the time they have with loved ones. It can also inspire people to make positive changes in their own lives or to carry on the legacy of their friend through acts of kindness or charity. While there may be moments of sadness and crying, a more lasting and positive outcome is commonly associated with inspiration rather than problems or trauma.
A chess set needs to be assembled or set up before it can be used to play chess. It typically consists of a board and 32 pieces (16 for each player), which need to be correctly placed on the board according to the rules of the game. The other options relate to the experience of playing chess (such as having fun or feeling satisfied) or the strategic aspects of the game, but they do not directly answer the question of what needs to happen before a chess set can be used.
Peanut butter is a common grocery item that can typically be found in supermarkets, along with other food items. Pantries and cupboards are places where food items may be stored, but they do not necessarily indicate where peanut butter can be bought. The option "jar" is not a location, but rather a type of container commonly used for storing peanut butter.
The sentence indicates that the patient was recovering well but still had a long way to go, which suggests that they were experiencing some discomfort or pain. Additionally, the patient's explanation is in the context of chatting with friends, which makes it unlikely that they would be discussing glee, fun, or inspiration. Laughter could be a possible option, but it is not supported by the context of the sentence. Therefore, discomfort is the most appropriate choice.
The word "talking" suggests that the individuals are communicating with one another, which is commonly referred to as having a conversation. Gossip and communication may also involve talking, but they do not necessarily imply multiple people speaking to one another. Sore throat and dry mouth are physical ailments, and are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the employee's ambition is valued by their boss, which may lead to a promotion or increased responsibility. Being put "in charge of a project" is a natural progression for employees who demonstrate ambition and leadership potential. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that running twenty six miles is a challenging task that requires careful planning and execution. One of the key factors in completing this task successfully is maintaining a steady pace throughout the run. This helps to conserve energy and prevent exhaustion, which can result in collapsing or needing to rest frequently. Sweat is a natural response to physical exertion and drinking water is important for hydration, but neither of these options specifically address the issue of pacing yourself during a long run.
The sentence suggests that the monkey was in a place where there was water around it, which is often found in forest settings where streams, rivers or ponds are present. The option "on a tree" is the most likely choice as monkeys are known to climb and live in trees. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the setting is a museum, which typically features exhibits of various types. Paintings are only one type of exhibit that can be found in a museum. Therefore, the correct answer is seeing artifacts as it is the most likely choice that can encompass other exhibits like sculptures, historical objects, and other types of art. The other options may also be present in a museum setting, but they do not necessarily relate to what one is viewing.
The sentence suggests that Sarah believes boys have something negative or undesirable that makes them unworthy of being kissed. The option "cooties" is a common term used by children to refer to an imagined contagion or undesirable trait that is associated with the opposite gender. The other options, such as "disease" and "halitosis," suggest a more serious concern that might be outside the scope of what is being discussed in the sentence. "Sweet" and "arousal" are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that hitting something is likely to cause broken glass in a car. Walls often are made of brick or concrete, which are hard materials that could damage a car upon impact. The other options, such as a field, bridge, bottom of sea, or street, do not typically involve structures that could cause broken glass in a car.
Lars Ulrich is a member of the band Metallica, which famously sued Napster for copyright infringement in the early 2000s. Therefore, the sentence suggests that Lars Ulrich would not be pleased if someone were to borrow a song from Napster (a file-sharing service known for facilitating the sharing of copyrighted music without permission). The other options do not have any clear connection to Lars Ulrich or the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the steak house is the best in a particular location, which is likely a smaller or more specific area than a country or a desert. The options of Japan and the United States are too broad, and the option of the desert does not make sense as a location for a steak house. Texas is known for its beef production and steak houses, but the more specific answer is that the steak house is the best in the town where the speaker comes from.
The sentence suggests that you are able to choose multiple options, and that one of the options is a color. This is commonly associated with roulette wheels, where you can bet on multiple numbers and also on specific colors such as red or black. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "someone without much to do" suggests that the person is not occupied or engaged in any activities, which can lead to feelings of boredom. The fact that they are driving indicates that they are looking for something to do or to pass the time. Enjoyment, moving, fatigue, and injuries do not necessarily provide a compelling reason for someone to keep driving without purpose.
The question is asking about a type of booking office that would be used for planning a trip, which suggests that the office would be related to travel. Out of the given options, only a travel agency is directly associated with travel and trip planning. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as an airport is not an office, England and city are not specific types of booking offices, and a police station is not related to travel.
The sentence suggests that inspiration is the starting point or foundation, and then something else is required to create something. The options "sew," "write," and "express" are too broad and do not necessarily require creativity to be successful. "Express yourself" is too vague and can encompass different forms of expression, including those that may not require creativity. "Create art" is a specific option that matches the context of the sentence and requires creativity to be successful.
The sentence suggests that the world is naturally divided into different regions, but humans have added an artificial layer of division by creating countries. This is a commonly recognized fact of human geography and political science. The other options, such as "universe" or "cake slices," do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the travelers were looking for a destination that was close and didn't require much money to get there, indicating that they may have been going back to their own home. The other options all involve transportation hubs that would likely require some distance and expense to reach, making them less likely choices.
The question is asking about the trait that a person would be exhibiting by avoiding imprudent decisions. "Imprudent" means unwise or not showing good judgment, so the trait being described here is one of carefulness or wisdom. Among the answer choices, "circumspect" best fits this description, as it means being cautious and considering all possible consequences before making a decision. "Discreet" and "prudent" also carry connotations of carefulness or wisdom, but "circumspect" is the most precise answer. "Immaturity" and "reasonable" are not synonyms for carefulness or caution, so they can be eliminated as options.
When someone eats, their stomach begins to expand, sending signals to the brain to indicate that they are starting to feel full. As they continue to eat, the stomach continues to expand, and those signals become stronger, eventually leading to a feeling of fullness that prompts the person to stop eating. The other options, such as gaining weight or discomfort, may also be factors that influence someone's decision to stop eating, but they do not directly relate to the physical sensation of feeling full. Gas and satisfaction may also influence someone's decision to stop eating, but they are not necessarily the primary cause.
The sentence implies that printing on a printer may produce some kind of noticeable sound or noise. This is true for most printers, which often make a distinct sound when printing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the outcome of the first opening of a business may not be successful, which means that the business may not make a profit. Therefore, the business may lose money during its initial stage of operation. The other options do not match the context of the sentence - making money, wealth, and getting rich all refer to profiting from the business, while grand opening refers to the launch event rather than the business itself.
A cloud is a visible mass of water droplets or ice crystals in the air. Therefore, it is logical to assume that clouds can be found in the air. The other choices may not necessarily relate to the location of a cloud, such as night or day, weather report or above rain. The atmosphere is a broad area that includes both air and outer space, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is cooling off quickly after exercising hard, which may be because she is experiencing a sudden drop in body temperature. Shivering is a natural response to this, as it helps to generate heat and maintain body temperature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Horses are commonly found in the American Southwest, particularly in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, which have vast deserts and rugged terrain that are ideal for horseback riding. Canada, State Fair, and Central Park are not known for their deserts or horse populations, making them unlikely options for where one would find a horse in the desert.
The sentence mentions that fencing is a sport, and like other sports, there is a risk of something. The options "pain" and "small cuts" may be common in sports, but they do not necessarily apply to fencing specifically. "Competition" is not a risk, but rather a component of the sport itself. "Puncture wound" is too specific and also implies injury. Therefore, "injury" is the most appropriate answer as it is a common risk in various sports, including fencing.
The sentence indicates that the wife started to worry when the man was setting a cup on a table, which suggests that something else was happening that alarmed her. The option "hands" is the most logical choice, as shaking hands can be a sign of nervousness or a medical condition. The other options, such as "breaking" or "coaster," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the lady bought multiple bags of chips and had her kids stuff them on shelves, which implies that she is storing the chips at home. The most likely place to store food items such as chips at home would be the pantry. The other options do not make sense in this context - a bar would not typically have shelves for storing chips, supermarket staff would be responsible for restocking shelves, and a motherboard is unrelated to the situation.
The word "crying" suggests that the baby is upset or in pain. The option "got injured" is the most likely reason for a baby to cry, as they may have been hurt or uncomfortable. The other options do not provide a clear reason for the baby's distress. "Too many moms" and "acting" are unlikely reasons, and "distraught" is too general to determine why the baby is upset.
The term "tentative agreement" suggests that the individual has come to some sort of agreement, although it may not be final or completely solidified. Therefore, it's likely that the person would feel some sense of relief or satisfaction that progress has been made towards a resolution. Uncertainty and compromise suggest that the person may still be unsure about the outcome, while relax and finished are too definitive and do not account for the tentative nature of the agreement.
The sentence states that James loved to play violin in his spare time, implying that he did it for enjoyment and not as a formal practice or lesson. Additionally, the word "relaxing" suggests that playing the violin was a way for James to unwind and destress, which would not be the case if he found it difficult to tune or had to take lessons to improve. Therefore, "relaxing" is most likely the correct answer.
In general, bodies of water in mountainous areas tend to be colder and less populated than those in other regions. This means that a lake in the mountains is more likely to be warm (relative to other mountain lakes), but also relatively untouched by human activities such as swimming, boating, or fishing. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where a warm but untouched lake might be found.
The sentence suggests that the pillowcase is already on a pillow, which would typically be located in a bedroom. The other options, such as "linen cupboard" and "linen closet," may be places where the pillowcase is stored or kept when not in use. "Allen key" is not related to the context of a pillow or bedroom.
The sentence mentions that John didn't appreciate the smell of the city, suggesting that there might be some form of pollution that is causing the unpleasant odor. The fact that the city has many roads and a lot of traffic also implies that there might be a high level of pollution in the area due to emissions from vehicles. The other choices, such as happiness or death, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Aisle and pew are terms commonly used in the context of churches, where pews are rows of benches used by the congregation for seating and the aisle is the central pathway between them. The other options do not have any clear connection to this context.
The question asks specifically about a liquid that can be kept in a large container. Juice is a commonly packaged and sold liquid that often comes in large containers such as jugs or cartons. The other options - door, shed, supermarket, and cabinet - are all objects that are not typically associated with storing liquid.
The term "fatigue" usually refers to a feeling of extreme tiredness or exhaustion, which suggests that the best course of action for someone experiencing this would be to rest their body as thoroughly as possible. While sitting down or having a rest might offer some respite, it is unlikely to be sufficient for someone who is experiencing full-body fatigue. Lying on the floor might be more restful than sitting, but it is still not the same as getting a full night's sleep. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is sleeping.
The sentence describes an entrance hall where a host is standing inside. The word "host" refers to a person who is there to greet and welcome others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as a palace, school, yoda, or house wouldn't normally have a host greeting visitors in their entrance hall.
The sentence suggests a process where a refined mineral is obtained through some sort of collection and mining. The word "refined" implies that the mineral being discussed has been processed or purified in some way. The word "mining" further suggests that the mineral is being extracted from the ground. The only answer choice that fits this context is "ore," which is a mineral or rock that contains valuable minerals that can be mined and processed into a refined form. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence or risk associated with knitting for an extended period of time. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition caused by repetitive motions, and it can be a result of activities such as knitting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A pen is a tool commonly used for writing and is usually stored in a place that is easily accessible when needed. The given choices include various locations, such as stores and classrooms, which are not places where one would typically store a pen. However, a desk drawer is a common place for office and school supplies to be stored, including pens. Therefore, the best choice is likely the desk drawer.
Vegetables are known to be a good source of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential for maintaining good health. Therefore, people who eat vegetables are often looking to obtain the nutritional benefits that come with consuming them. While some of the other choices may be related to eating vegetables, such as preparing them or keeping one's mouth open, they do not address the main reason why people choose to eat vegetables in the first place.
The sentence suggests that the person is seeking attention and approval from their father, which implies a desire for recognition. Winning a baseball game, which is an achievement, is often a source of recognition and praise, especially from parents. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a sense of validation or acknowledgement.
The sentence suggests that it is important to listen to the dialogue while watching a movie in a theater, which requires a quiet crowd. The options "understand," "able to hear," and "pay attention" are all related to the act of listening, but only "very quiet" directly addresses the need for a silent audience. "Shut up" is too informal and aggressive for the context and would not be appropriate in a polite setting like a movie theater.
The sentence suggests that the person is eating breakfast because they are hungry, which implies that their goal is to satisfy their hunger. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. Heartburn is a possible negative consequence of eating breakfast, but it is not the goal. Weight gain, overeating, and gaining energy are all possible outcomes of eating breakfast, but they are not necessarily the person's goal.
The sentence suggests that even though Bill wasn't religious and didn't engage in praying himself, he recognized that Lilly was experiencing a certain feeling from it. The description of this feeling as a "sense of peace" suggests that Bill perceived her praying as having a calming effect on her. The other options (good feeling, relief, feel safer, wasted time) may be potential benefits or criticisms of praying, but they do not reflect the specific experience that Bill observed in Lilly.
The sentence suggests that the country in question is wary of joining the union for fear that it will make them lose their current status. The word "province" implies that the country may feel that joining the union would reduce them to a subordinate position, as provinces are often seen as secondary to the country they belong to. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Taking a bath involves soaking in water for a prolonged period, which can lead to the loss of natural oils from the skin, resulting in dryness. While other options like drowning and rash are potential risks of bathing, they are not common occurrences. The use of water and wet skin are necessary consequences of taking a bath and do not constitute side effects.
The word "socks" suggests that Bill is looking for something related to clothing or footwear, which is sold in stores that specialize in those items. The options "paint," "bed," "bureau," and "suitcase" are unlikely to be associated with clothing or footwear. Therefore, "sporting goods store" is the most appropriate answer.
A symphony is a type of musical composition typically performed by an orchestra, and these types of performances are usually held in concert halls. Movie theatres and circus tents are not typically used for classical music performances. While some theatre productions may feature live music, it is not common for symphonies to be performed in this setting. Gymnasiums are also an unlikely venue choice for symphony performances, as they lack the acoustics and seating capacity that concert halls offer.
The context suggests that John was embarrassed about something related to the hot spring, which indicates that the correct answer is likely to be something that is commonly associated with hot springs. In Japan, hot springs are often public and require nudity, which can be uncomfortable for some individuals. The other options such as cleanliness, other people, dry skin, or using soap do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the answer will involve a location where a student can store books when they are not using them. Of the options given, a backpack is the most common and practical location for students to store their books while on-the-go or traveling between classes. A table or shelf might be used to temporarily hold books while studying, but they are not typically used for long-term storage. The floor and cabinet are also possible locations, but they are less common and not as convenient as a backpack.
The use of the word "large" suggests that the rocks being referred to are likely significant in size. Mountains are known for having large rocks, while the other options do not necessarily have this association. The surface of the earth and the ground may have rocks, but they may not be large. A quarry is a man-made excavation site where rocks are extracted, but it is not necessarily known for having large rocks. The countryside is a broad term that does not necessarily have a strong association with rocks.
The sentence suggests that the situation of listening to your mother telling childhood stories to your date might cause a particular feeling. Embarrassment is a common feeling associated with situations where someone feels exposed or uncomfortable, especially when the stories being told may be embarrassing or personal. Learning, empathy, and anxiety do not connect as closely to this situation, while fatigue may be a feeling, but it does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone is receiving cooked potatoes from an employee, which is a scenario that is likely to occur in a restaurant or food service establishment. The other options do not make sense in this context - the bathroom and cellar are unlikely places to receive food, and "plate" is not a location. "Countryside" also does not make sense, as it does not provide any information about where the potatoes may have been cooked or served.
The sentence suggests that despite John getting a raise, he also experienced a decrease in his rank or position. The word "lower" is the opposite of "higher," which would make sense in the context of losing rank. The other options, such as demotion or push down, have negative connotations and are not necessarily reflective of the overall tone of the sentence, which suggests a positive outcome despite the decrease in rank. Additionally, the option "go off strike" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a potential consequence of making a mistake while skating. One common consequence of skating missteps is falling, which is closely related to the option "may fall." The other options, such as "having fun" and "flying to the moon," do not seem to fit the context of the sentence and are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the scythe was previously sharp, but by the end of the field it was no longer cutting effectively. This implies that the scythe has become blunt, which means that the cutting edge is no longer sharp or pointed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence uses the word "very bad" to describe the place where it would be undesirable to find a crab. The options such as Chesapeake Bay, Seychelles, fishing boat and cooking pot are all places or objects where one might expect to find crabs, but underpants is not a typical location for a crab. This implies that it would be very unpleasant for someone to discover a crab in their underpants.
The sentence mentions that John is walking down an aisle that has over the counter medication and assorted items such as toys, candy, and whatnot. This suggests that John is in a store that primarily sells medication, such as a drugstore. The other options are less likely because they do not specialize in selling medication, and in the case of a gas station, they typically only have a small selection of snacks and beverages, not a full aisle of over the counter medication.
The sentence suggests that Sally went to the wrong house while she was drunk, implying that she was intending to visit someone specific. The option "belong to" suggests that the house belongs to someone who is Sally's neighbor, which would explain why she was intending to visit them. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James shaving resulted in a lot of hair being left behind, which is commonly associated with shaving one's head. The other options - arm, floor, sink, moustache - do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is hoping to find a live koala in its natural habitat rather than in a zoo, indicating that they are planning to go on a wildlife adventure. The Australian outback is a vast and remote area that is known for its diverse range of flora and fauna, including koalas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and none of them are typical habitats for koalas.
The sentence suggests that the token was discarded in a careless manner, which would make it likely to end up on the floor rather than in a pocket, ashtray, or coin collection. The mention of a slot machine could be a potential red herring, as it could suggest that the token ended up in the machine, but the sentence explicitly states that it was tossed aside.
The sentence implies that the person committed murder but did so in self defense, meaning they may have had no other choice to protect themselves. However, the use of the word "still" suggests that the person feels some negative emotion about what they did, indicating regret. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not reflect the potential emotional response of someone who has committed murder.
Playing games is generally considered a leisure activity that people engage in for enjoyment and entertainment. The option "fun" best describes this rationale for playing games as it aligns with the general understanding of why people choose to play games. The options "keep score," "try to win," and "attempt to win" are related to playing games, but are more specific reasons for playing certain types of games (e.g., competitive games) rather than the general rationale for playing games. "Bored" may be a reason some people play games, but it is not the primary or most common reason.
The word "try to escape" suggests that the marmot is trying to avoid being caught or seen. The option "hide" is the most logical answer because it would allow the marmot to remain concealed from the person looking for it. The other options do not provide a specific action that could help the marmot evade capture.
The sentence suggests that John experiences slower internet searches as a result of his router going to sleep. The term "latency" refers to the time delay between a request and a response in a computer network, which can cause slower internet speeds. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for a hike and needs to know where to put the rope. The option "backpack" makes the most sense as it is a common place to store equipment while hiking. The other options, such as "swimming pool" and "boat," do not have any obvious connection to hiking and the option "lay down" doesn't make sense in terms of storing equipment. The option "lower person" is also unlikely as there is no context to suggest that someone else will be joining the hike.
The word "trivial" suggests something that is unimportant or insignificant. Therefore, the answer choice that is least likely to be trivial would be one that is important or essential. The word "fundamental" means basic or essential, and is often used to describe core values or principles. Therefore, "fundamental" is the most likely correct answer choice in this context. The other answer choices have varying degrees of importance or significance, but do not necessarily convey a sense of essentiality.
The sentence implies that the person being referred to in the question is a leader who gets inaugurated. The most common type of leader who undergoes an inauguration ceremony is the leader of a country, usually a president or a prime minister. The other options, such as earth or pack, do not have any clear association with a leader who gets inaugurated.
The sentence suggests that Greg didn't have an interest in academics or history, so it's likely he wasn't engaged or entertained by the museum. The feeling of being crushed implies a negative emotion, and the option that best reflects that negative emotion is boredom. The other options (inspiration, enjoyment, itchiness, sore feet) do not accurately reflect the sentiment conveyed in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question used to have an accent due to being foreign, but now they no longer have one. The word "native" refers to someone who is born in a particular place or has lived there for a long time, and it makes sense in this context since the person is assumed to be a local without any accent. The other options do not fit well since they don't necessarily have anything to do with the idea of being a local or having no accent.
The sentence suggests that the corner shop is a central location in a small community where people gather and socialize. The word "epicenter" implies that this location is the heart of the community. The other options (England, Iowa, city, street corner) do not provide any context or information that would indicate they are the setting for a small community with a central gathering spot.
Drinking with the intention to get drunk often leads to a feeling of euphoria, which is a sense of intense happiness, excitement, and well-being. The other options describe the negative consequences that can come after drinking, such as hangovers or loss of control, but do not describe the immediate physical experience of drinking with the intention of getting drunk.
Giving something other than money to a clerk implies a transaction where a person would exchange something in lieu of payment. At a ticket booth, the exchange would likely be tickets or tokens for admission. At a hotel or shop, payment is typically made in cash or card, although in some circumstances a business may accept trade or bartering. At a post office, one would typically exchange goods for postage or other mailing services. A bookstore is the most likely option where a person may exchange a book or other item as part of a transaction.
Highlighters are commonly used in legal cases to emphasize important information in documents or transcripts. They are often used by lawyers or paralegals during the preparation and review of legal documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of using a highlighter in a legal case.
The sentence suggests that the woman is in a deep state of unhappiness and that she believes that murder is the only solution to end her suffering. The context implies that her problem is related to her relationship with her husband, making marriage the most appropriate option. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence implies that the person is going somewhere and his parents want to know when he has arrived at his destination. The other options, such as fart, get lost, or go back, have no relevance to the context of the sentence. The option "meet" could also be a possibility, but the sentence indicates that the person is going somewhere, not meeting someone. So, arrive there is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the scientist was analyzing test results in order to arrive at a conclusion about a theory. To "come to a conclusion" means to reach a decision or belief about something, which is often the goal of scientific analysis. The other options, such as "learn new" or "think about," do not necessarily imply the same level of deliberate analysis or decision-making. "Ball stopped" and "look at" are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the items listed (pencils and paper) would be useful for a specific activity. The word "curiosity" suggests that this activity is one where learning or exploration is encouraged, which aligns with the idea of attending school. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Silicone is commonly used in the production of artificial breasts, and it can sometimes cause irritation if it gets stuck on the skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to silicone causing irritation when it gets stuck.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was in an IMAX theatre and the screen was so large that it felt like being outdoors. This eliminates options like monitor, movies, and home, which would not be associated with a large screen that makes you feel like you are outdoors. Drive-in movies do have large screens, but they are located outdoors, so this option does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is theatre.
The word "marmot" provides a clue as to the type of animal being described. Marmots are a type of ground squirrel that is commonly found in mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. The other options do not match the natural habitat or geographic location of marmots.
The question is asking about a business that is likely to have few cubicles, which suggests that the business is not primarily focused on individual workspaces. The option "playing" is the only one that doesn't involve a traditional workplace or office environment, and therefore is the most likely answer. The other options are all typical locations where cubicles might be found, such as banks, office buildings, or workplaces where dividing workspaces are necessary.
The sentence suggests that Josh's normal routine involves staying up late, which means he may have difficulty adjusting to a nine to five job that requires him to wake up early. This could result in him getting less sleep than he's used to. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When a person is full, their stomach becomes distended, making their clothes feel tighter and more form-fitting. "Close fitting" describes the way clothing fits when it is snug against the body, which is likely to happen when a person is full. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Gambling is typically associated with casinos, where people can play a variety of games like poker, blackjack, and slot machines. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - a show, fairgrounds, buying lottery tickets, and going to a friend's house are not necessarily associated with gambling.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is not traveling, but still needs to store their clothing. Suitcases are typically used for travel and are not commonly used for storage in a home setting. Drawers and dressers are typically used for storing folded clothing, but may not be suitable for hanging a shirt. A dirty laundry basket is for clothing that has been worn and requires washing. A garment bag, on the other hand, is a specific type of bag designed for storing and transporting clothing, particularly those that need to be hung up like shirts.
Secondary education typically refers to high school or equivalent education. After completing this level of education, many individuals choose to continue their studies in higher education by entering college or university. Feeling lonely, crossing the street or passing exams are not related to secondary education specifically, while graduating from high school is synonymous with completing secondary education.
The sentence implies that the person is looking for both clothing and electronics, which are typically not found in the same type of store. However, department stores often carry a wide variety of products, including clothing and electronics, making them a likely option for someone seeking both items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "stage fright" is commonly used to describe the fear and anxiety that many people experience before and during a public speaking or performance event. This knowledge can help eliminate options like "ridiculous" and "happiness" which are not typically associated with this type of situation. The option "open sores" is completely unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. The remaining option, "different", does not provide enough information to determine whether it is correct or not, making "anxiety" the most likely correct answer.
The question is asking about a test that requires an "answer," suggesting that the test involves responding to specific prompts or questions. "Swear" and "wrong" are not typically associated with test-taking, while "problem" is too vague to be a good answer choice. "Question" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to the idea of answering prompts or queries.
The question is asking about the consequences of a building that is no longer needed. In general, if a building is not maintained or used, it will eventually deteriorate and collapse. This is because buildings are designed to withstand the weight and stresses of their intended use, and if they are left unoccupied and unmaintained, the structural integrity can be compromised. The other options do not make sense in this context - casting a shadow, facing north, or being a target are not necessarily related to a building's usefulness or condition, and weathering a storm could potentially damage a building, but it would not cause it to collapse entirely.
The sentence mentions a waiter cleaning up a spilled soup bowl, which implies that the person who spilled it was dining at a restaurant. The other options (cabinet, apartment, dishwasher, washing machine) are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any relevant information to help choose the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that someone wants to bring about change in their society, which requires some kind of action from their government. The option "new laws" is the most logical choice as laws are often used to regulate society and bring about change. "Happiness for" is not clear in its meaning and does not relate to the context of the sentence. "Give up" and "acceptance" do not suggest any proactive measures for bringing about change. "Cultural revolution" may bring about change, but it is not necessarily something that the government can provide.
The term "multitask" suggests that the person would need at least two computers to perform several tasks simultaneously. This is because a single computer can only handle one task at a time efficiently. Sharing files, doing work, or doing arithmetic can all be done on a single computer, and would not require multiple devices. Costing money also does not make sense in this context, as it is not an action that can be performed using computers.
The sentence implies that the snake was found in a natural environment, specifically a cave. North of Texas is not typically associated with indoor or built environments like a bedroom or basement. "Ball stopped" does not make any sense in this context. Oklahoma is located south of Texas, so it is unlikely the snake would have been found there if it was specifically stated to be north of Texas. A tropical forest, however, is a type of natural environment where snakes are commonly found, and it is plausible that a cave in a tropical forest could be located north of Texas.
When a pet goes missing, the first place to look for it is usually in the surrounding area of the owner's home. The most common location for pets to wander off to is the back yard or porch as it is a familiar environment for the pet. The other options, like the road or neighbor's house, may also be searched later on, but the back yard is usually the first place to begin the search. The option 'farmyard' may not apply if the owner has no access to one.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is a member of a musical ensemble, specifically one that includes young amateur musicians. The options "chef," "abc book," and "museum" do not fit this context at all. While "orchestra" is a type of ensemble, the fact that the sentence mentions a xylophone suggests that the group may be smaller and less formal than a full orchestra, making "high school band" the most likely choice.
The sentence suggests that the method being referred to is a way of expressing oneself while also creating an object of lasting beauty. This is commonly associated with the creation of art, as art is often seen as a form of self-expression and can produce beautiful objects that endure over time. The other options, such as being slapped or experiencing pain, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not commonly associated with creating objects of beauty.
The question is asking about how one typically rest when laying down in a bed. "Sleeping" is the most appropriate answer because it is the most common activity people do when they lay down in bed to rest. The other choices - in motion, using energy, action, and rapidly - do not accurately describe the typical resting position or activity when laying down in a bed.
Resting when tired usually results in the individual falling asleep. This is because the body naturally tends to shut down and enter a state of sleep when it is tired in order to recuperate and rebuild energy. The other options, such as time passing or lying down, do not necessarily indicate that the individual will fall asleep. Snoring is also not always a given when someone falls asleep.
Shopping centers and cities are both locations where multiple businesses or destinations are gathered in a relatively small area, leading to a higher demand for parking spaces. Airports may have multiple parking lots as well, but this is not always the case and the context of the question does not suggest that an airport is being referred to. Circuses often set up in temporary locations and would not typically have designated parking lots.
The sentence suggests that the builder is looking for wood to build a new home, which is commonly purchased from a lumberyard. Lumberyards specialize in selling wood products for construction, such as dimensional lumber, plywood, and siding. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the musician had a big break in the entertainment industry by playing their instrument for a soundtrack. This suggests that the musician has some proficiency and experience in composing or arranging music for visual media, such as a movie. The other options (magazine, case, concert hall, orchestra) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence explicitly states that James was a mean person, which contradicts the options of generous, nice, friendly, and kindness. The only option that aligns with the description of James is mean cruel, indicating that he was not just mean but also cruel.
The sentence suggests that the men had a lunch break, which implies that they were doing something before the break. The verb "resume" means to start again after a pause or interruption, so the correct answer must be an activity that was interrupted by the lunch break and then continued afterwards. Working is the most likely option, as it is a common activity that can be interrupted and resumed easily. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
A boat is a vessel designed to travel on water, so the correct answer must be a body of water. Harbors and lakes are specific locations where boats can be found, while sailing is the act of operating a boat on water. The ocean is a vast body of saltwater and is a type of water, but not all boats are meant to travel on the ocean. Therefore, the correct answer is water.
The sentence suggests that agreeing with everyone can lead to getting caught in the middle of conflicting opinions or issues, which creates a difficult situation, i.e., a problem. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a wooden rod was used to wind up something that was freestanding, which indicates that it was likely a mechanical object that needed to be wound up manually. The only option that fits this criteria is "old clock", as clocks in the past often required winding by hand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is back in their hometown and planning to have fun, which implies that they have people there they know and want to spend time with. Out of the options given, "visiting friends" is the most logical choice as it aligns with the idea of returning to a place you are familiar with and catching up with old acquaintances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Dogs are social animals that crave attention and love from their owners. Providing affection, such as petting, cuddling, or playing, is important for their emotional wellbeing and happiness. While going outside and being walked are also essential for a dog's physical and mental health, guard houses and rolling over are not typically associated with a dog's happiness.
The sentence suggests that chatting with friends about current events leads to something happening. One logical outcome of such an activity is that people exchange information and ideas with one another. The other options may also occur during such conversations, but they are not as directly related to the act of discussing current events with friends. Laughter may occur during any kind of social interaction, hope may be felt independently of conversation, feeling close to others may be a byproduct of any socializing, and social approval could be sought in a variety of contexts.
The sentence implies that a local terrorist has committed a crime and would be apprehended by law enforcement. In most cases, terrorists are taken into custody and sent to prison to serve sentences for their actions. The other options such as airport, hijack planes, hotel, and Afghanistan are not logical or legal consequences for acts of terrorism.
The question is asking about how a foreign exchange student can navigate and communicate in a new country. Learning the language is a crucial step in achieving this, as it allows the student to communicate with locals, read signs and menus, and understand instructions. Doing mathematics, reading a book, answering a question, or beginning to study may be important tasks for a student in general, but they do not directly relate to the challenges of being a foreign exchange student.
Burning logs are often used to create a fire for warmth and/or cooking purposes while camping. The other options such as making breakfast, going swimming, packing or heading out for a hike do not have any clear connection to burning logs.
A clerk is typically associated with working in a shop or store, where they assist customers with purchases and handle transactions. The other options do not involve buying goods or services directly from a clerk. Post offices often have clerks, but they handle mail and packages rather than retail sales. Hotels might have front desk staff or concierges, but they don't usually sell things directly to guests. Airports have checkpoints and ticket counters, but again, these employees don't typically act as clerks for retail transactions. Bookstores do have clerks, but the word "clerk" is more commonly associated with general retail or grocery stores.
The context of the sentence suggests that Sarah was in a work setting or a place where an office would be located. Putting food in a trash can beside a desk is a common practice in office environments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to staying warm while watching television. The most common place to watch television in a home is usually the livingroom, which is also where most people keep their blankets or comforters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the individual is looking for a location to work on their needlepoint near their front door. The living room is often a central location in a home and may be near the front door. The other options, such as thread or an artscraft store, do not provide a location for the individual to work on their needlepoint. Sewing and frame may be related to needlepoint, but they do not provide a specific location for the individual to work.
The sentence suggests that the object being described has multiple "heads" that need to breathe air, but the air is not fresh. This seems to describe a submarine, which typically has multiple people on board who need to breathe air that has been recycled and may not be fresh. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John is experiencing a dream where he is falling, but it does not provide any information about what might happen when he hits the ground. However, the context implies that John is sleeping and experiencing a dream, rather than actually falling in real life. Therefore, the most likely outcome when he hits the ground in his dream is that he would wake up. The other options are either too extreme or not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the housemate was bored with what the others were doing and decided to do something else. Among the choices, the most likely activity that he chose to do is reading a book, as it is a solitary and intellectually stimulating option that does not require the participation of others. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a traditional place to have a rocking chair, which is commonly associated with sitting and relaxing outside on a front porch. The other options do not have a strong connection to the traditional use of a rocking chair. A parlor may have been traditional in the past, but is less common today. A rock concert would not be a traditional place for a rocking chair. An old folks home may have rocking chairs, but it is not necessarily a traditional place for them. A rocking chair in a child's room may be common, but it is not a traditional use of a rocking chair.
The question is referencing the habitat of a jellyfish, which typically lives in bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and lakes. The options "book" and "store" do not make sense in the context of the question, and "forest" is unlikely because jellyfish require water to survive. "Current" is also a valid option, as jellyfish can survive in ocean currents, but the question specifically asks for a location where they can stay alive, not just move around.
The idea of a romantic vacation typically conjures up images of European cities, particularly Paris which is known for its romantic atmosphere. The mention of sitting at a cafe on the streets also supports this association as Paris is renowned for its cafe culture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is referring to a dentist who has finished working on a patient's teeth and needs to put away his tools. The correct answer would therefore be "instruments," as this is the term commonly used for dental tools. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this context.
Recreational centers often have sports facilities available to the general public, including tennis courts. Athletic clubs and country clubs are often exclusive to members and may require special fees or memberships. College campuses may have tennis courts, but they are primarily intended for use by students and faculty. A zoo would not typically have a tennis court.
The use of cleats in grass typically indicates that a sporting event took place. The word "soccer" in the choice list indicates a strong possibility that this is what occurred, as soccer is a sport that is often played on grass and players often wear cleats. The other options, such as fairgrounds or playground, do not have the same connection to cleats and torn up grass.
Musicals are a form of theater that usually involve singing and dancing. The sentence suggests that an actor in a musical does something related to the musical aspect of the performance. Singing songs is a common activity for actors in musicals, as it allows them to convey emotions and advance the storyline through music. The other options, such as branch out or wear costume, do not accurately describe what an actor in a musical typically does.
The sentence suggests that horses need something to survive, and it specifically mentions that Joe cannot provide for them. The option "drink water" is something that all living organisms need to survive, so it is likely the correct answer. The other options are more specific to the movement or function of horses, but do not address their basic needs for survival.
The question suggests that the pet jellyfish is kept in a specific location, which rules out options like Australia, movie, and shore. A Japanese restaurant may have jellyfish on the menu, but it is unlikely that they would be kept as pets. A tank is a common place to keep pet jellyfish, as they require a specific environment and care to survive. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be tank.
The question implies that the missing organ is a biological one, and therefore, can only be obtained from another living organism. The option "black market" suggests an illegal and unethical way of obtaining organs, which is not a viable or recommended option. "Music store," "system," and "cathedral" have no connection to the context of the question.
In the context of the sentence, the person being judged is likely in a legal setting where a fair trial is a basic right. A fair trial includes the right to a trial without undue delay, to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, to be informed of the charges, to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense, to be tried in one's presence, and to have legal representation. The other options are not related to the context of a legal trial.
The sentence suggests that John did not enjoy seeing the massive ball of yarn, which implies that he found it unimpressive or uninteresting. "Lame" is a word often used to describe something that is unimpressive or disappointing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a cause of losing consciousness specifically related to the head. A blow to the head is a common cause of a concussion or other traumatic brain injury that can result in loss of consciousness. Coma and death are more severe outcomes that can occur as a result of a head injury, but they are not a direct cause of losing consciousness. Falling down could potentially result in a head injury, but it is not as specific as a blow to the head.
The context of the sentence implies that the child was not receiving the care they needed, and the teacher took some action to address this. "Taking care" is the most appropriate choice, as it conveys the idea of providing for someone's well-being. "Regard" and "consideration" could be interpreted as showing concern for the child, but do not necessarily imply action to address their needs. "Assumed" and "notice" are not relevant to the situation in the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the children were participating in a game, which implies an activity. The sentence also suggests that the children were enjoying themselves, which supports the idea that the activity was fun. The other choices - effort, exercise, relaxing, and playing around - do not fit as well because they either do not directly relate to the act of playing a game or do not fit the context of the sentence.
A telephone is an electronic device that requires speakers or a headphone to hear the caller's voice. Desktops are devices used to access the Internet or run programs and do not have built-in speakers or headphones, so it is unlikely that you would hear a telephone while using a desktop. The other options, such as a house, friend's house, party, or hospital, are locations where telephones are commonly heard or expected to be present.
The sentence explicitly refers to the infidelity of John's sound system, which suggests that he expected loyalty and faithfulness from it. The term "infidelity" is commonly used to describe a breach of trust or betrayal, which reinforces the idea that John felt let down by his sound system. The other options, such as ending a marriage or mean shooting, have no relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people enjoy various things, but the most common way they experience something is through television. It implies that people use television as a means of entertainment, which is often associated with watching shows, movies, or other content that is meant to engage and entertain the viewer. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence - eye strain and visual refer more to the physical effects of watching television, while laziness and distracted do not necessarily relate to the act of using television as a form of leisure.
Airports are known for having long-term or overnight parking options for travelers who need to leave their cars behind while on a trip. A shopping center or business district may have a parking lot, but it is more likely that people will park there for short periods of time while they are running errands or attending meetings. A swimming pool and city may also have parking options, but there is no clear connection to leaving a car for an extended period of time.
The sentence suggests that the cooking style of the unfamiliar steak house is not commonly found in Western cuisine. The options "Mexico," "Texas," and "New York" are all locations within the Western hemisphere and therefore their cuisine would not be unfamiliar to Western palettes. The option "ocean" is not a location and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the cooking style is most likely from a location outside of the Western hemisphere, which narrows down the options to Japan. Japanese cuisine is known for its unique and distinct flavors, and therefore it is likely that the cooking style of the steak house originated from Japan.
The word "go forth" suggests a forward movement, and the phrase "drive the enemy" implies an aggressive action of pushing them in a certain direction. "Straightforth" is not a commonly used word and does not fit with the phrasing of the sentence. "Back and" and "reverse" imply a backward movement, which does not fit with the context of attacking the enemy. "Backwards" could be a possible answer but it is more natural to use "forward".
Sofabeds are commonly used as a space-saving solution for guests staying overnight. Most people don't have a spare room that can be dedicated solely to guests, so a sofabed is often kept in a shared living space, such as a livingroom or sitting room. A one room apartment may not have enough space to accommodate a sofabed, and it would be uncommon to keep a sofabed in a bathroom.
The sentence mentions the word "oil," suggesting that the container can is used for automotive purposes. The most likely location for such a container can would be the garage, where the car is usually parked and maintained. The other options, such as liquid, store, pantry, and gutter, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker usually doesn't like Adam Sandler, so the fact that they found his latest movie surprising must mean that it was different from his usual style. The fact that the speaker found it funny suggests that the movie was a comedy, which is a genre Sandler is well-known for. The other options do not provide any insight into why the speaker found the movie surprising.
The sentence implies that James strongly disliked waiting in line, which suggests that the experience was unpleasant or frustrating for him. The word "hated" also indicates a strong negative emotional reaction, which rules out the options of linearity and have to wait for as being too neutral. The option of long wait might also be a possibility, but irritation more specifically captures a negative emotional state. The option of anger is also too extreme and does not necessarily fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that spending time finding information on operating something leads to a desired outcome or achievement. The most logical option would be "being able to use" since finding information on how to operate something would equip the person with the necessary knowledge to properly use the item. "Know how to act" could be a possibility, but it is not as directly related to operating something. "Full capacity" and "solution to problem" are also not directly related to operating something, while "gaining knowledge" is too broad and does not specifically address the purpose of finding information on operating something.
Plush seats are typically associated with comfort and luxury, making them a common feature in theaters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of plush seats.
The sentence suggests that misbehaving while attending school could result in some form of punishment that occurs after school hours. Detention is a common form of punishment for misbehavior, where a student is required to stay after school and complete additional work or remain in a designated area. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as they do not suggest a form of punishment for misbehavior.
The question is asking for the reason people want to swim in the heat, and the context indicates that the heat is uncomfortable. Therefore, the most likely reason people want to swim is to cool down. The other options - wearing a bathing suit, having fun, or exercising - could also be reasons people swim, but they do not directly address the issue of being hot and needing to cool down. Additionally, "exercise" is listed twice, but it is not necessarily a reason people want to swim in the heat.
In the 1700s, America was still a British colony and tensions were growing between the colonists and the British government. Many American colonists who were Christian felt that Britain was not treating them fairly and sought to rebel against British rule. This led to the American Revolution, which ultimately resulted in America gaining independence from Britain. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence describes a situation where someone is outdoors and encounters a large, frightening bug that they need to smash. In this context, the most likely object to use as a tool for smashing a bug would be a rock, which is a hard and sturdy object commonly found outdoors. The other options, such as tree or rug, are unlikely to be useful in this situation.
While watching TV can certainly provide a distraction or help someone fall asleep, the question specifically asks about a benefit one could gain. Watching TV can also provide an opportunity to learn new information or gain knowledge about a variety of topics, whether through educational programming or simply exposure to different perspectives and ideas. Therefore, the correct answer is "learn." The option "have TV" seems like it may be a possible benefit, but it is not a benefit FROM watching TV, but rather an access to watching TV. The option "sitting" may not be a benefit either, as it is not something that comes directly from watching TV, but rather a part of the experience of watching TV.
The mention of children suggests that the location being described is likely a residential area where families live. The term "neighborhood" is often used to describe such areas and is therefore the most relevant choice. The other options, such as suburbs or countryside, may not necessarily imply the presence of children or a concern for their safety.
The phrase "hot cats" is likely referring to felines, which are carnivorous animals that typically eat meat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of cats and their behavior.
The sentence suggests that the man referred to the state where he was from as something other than North Carolina, indicating that he used a shorter or more informal name for the state. The only option that fits this description is "carolina," as it is a nickname commonly used for both North Carolina and its neighboring state, South Carolina. The other options either do not describe North Carolina or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "wiggling" suggests that the dog is moving around during grooming, which can increase the likelihood of injury. Grooming involves the use of sharp tools and potentially hot water, so it's important for the dog to remain still. Mistakes, being late, and beauty are not directly related to the potential consequences of a dog wiggling during grooming. Pain may be a possible consequence, but injury is the most specific and likely outcome.
The sentence suggests that the person has a preference for purchasing their food at a farmer's market rather than a grocery store. This implies that they prioritize the freshness and quality of the produce they are purchasing, which is a common characteristic of farmer's markets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the location of small city halls, which implies that they are not located in large cities like Detroit or in specific buildings like an opera house. The word "small" also suggests that these city halls are not located in busy commercial areas like downtown, but rather in smaller communities such as towns. The option "court" may seem plausible, but it does not fit the context of the question as it refers to a specific type of building rather than a general location.
Bacteria is commonly found in soil, sediment, and water, making options "ground" and "water" the most likely correct choices. Bacteria can also be found in other environments, such as the human gut or in a petri dish (if deliberately grown), but these options are less likely based on the context of the question. "Lake" may be a possible choice, but it is less specific than "water." "Toilet bowl" is unlikely, as it is not a natural environment for bacteria.
The sentence implies that the decoration of the horse is related to an event or spectacle it is participating in. A parade is a common event where horses are often decorated with costumes and ornaments, which could explain why the horse in question was decorated. The other options do not provide a clear context for the decoration of the horse.
The question suggests that a long session of procreating may have negative consequences. Since procreating involves physical activity, it is likely to cause exhaustion, especially if it is prolonged. The other options are either too general (having children, reproduction) or don't fit the context of the sentence (feeling good, overpopulation).
Assuming that the individual will be traveling to another building, they will need to carry the scissors with them. Out of the given choices, a backpack is the most suitable option as it is portable and can easily be taken to another building. A haversack or cabinet may be stationary in one location, a desk may not be practical to carry around, and a house is too vague and may not be accessible or relevant to the situation.
The use of English and French on signs is a common characteristic of Canada, which is a bilingual country. This suggests that the travelers had likely crossed into Canada from an English-speaking part of the country and were now in a region where both English and French are commonly used. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the children had been playing for a while, which implies that they may start feeling exhausted. The option "getting tired" seems to be the most appropriate choice for this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Fights and competitiveness are not a natural outcome of playing, and learning is not mentioned in the sentence. Having fun might be a possible answer, but it does not capture the physical aspect suggested by the "playing" verb.
The sentence implies that something needs to be recorded, which is typically done using a device known as a recorder. A recorder is designed to capture audio or video, making it a suitable option for recording lectures, meetings, or interviews. The other options, such as tape or documentation of facts, are less likely to be used in modern times due to advancements in technology. Writing on paper is also a valid option, but it may not be practical in all situations. A spell checker is a digital tool used to check spelling errors, which is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a method to keep animals out of a garden, which suggests the need for a physical barrier. A fence is a common solution to this problem and is often used to enclose gardens and keep animals from accessing the area. The other options do not provide a practical solution for keeping animals out of a garden.
The context of the question suggests that the person is asking about how to watch a film before it is available on video, which means they are looking for a screening of the film in a movie theater. The option "go to movies" is the only one that directly addresses the question and is a common and well-established way of watching films before they are released on video. The other options do not provide any relevant information or are not practical solutions.
The sentence suggests that you are in a social setting with friends and that you have agreed with one of them while disagreeing with another. The phrase "side with" is commonly used to indicate that you are taking a particular person's side in an argument or discussion. The other options, such as "keep secrets" or "lying," do not fit the context of the sentence and are not relevant to the situation described.
The word "judge" often implies a moral evaluation of a person's behavior or character. When we judge someone, we tend to either condemn or condone their actions based on our own values and beliefs. The other options, such as "gathering information" or "gathering facts," may be steps we take before making a judgment, but do not necessarily describe the act of judging itself. "Alienate" and "talk about them" are not directly related to the act of judging.
The sentence suggests that the wallpaper is in a state of deterioration or decline, which is commonly associated with decay. Wet and damp conditions can lead to dampness, mold, and decay in many materials, including wallpaper. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they describe actions that would worsen or remove the wallpaper, rather than describe its current state.
The sentence suggests that the train stations being referred to are large, which implies that they are located in areas with high population density and significant transportation needs. "Big city" is a logical choice as train stations in large urban centers like New York, Tokyo, and London are likely to be the largest ones. The other options, such as an ocean or the downtown area, do not make sense in the context of train stations.
The sentence implies that the woman is concerned about something that might happen during a long drive, which could exacerbate an existing physical condition. Of the choices given, "backache" is the most likely to be aggravated by sitting for an extended period of time in a car. The other options (Michigan, car crash, automobile accidents, getting tired) do not relate to a specific physical condition or concern.
Nails are typically sold in hardware or home improvement stores, making "store" the most likely answer. Supermarkets typically do not sell nails, and jars, containers, and cabinets are unlikely places to find nails unless they were already stored there.
This question asks for the location where apple trees drop their fruit, which is commonly known to be on the ground. Apple trees are known to drop their fruit when it is ripe and ready for harvesting or consumption. The other options, such as outside, park, and Uzbekistan, do not have any clear relevance to the context of the question.
A cruet is a container often used for oils, dressings, and other liquid condiments, including lipids like oil or butter. A saltshaker is commonly used alongside a cruet on a dining table or in a kitchen setting to season these condiments. The other options (kitchen cupboard, cabinet, teaspoon, table setting) do not have any direct connection to the use of a saltshaker in relation to lipids.
The sentence mentions bulls, which is a common cultural element associated with Spain. Spain is known for its bullfighting tradition and has many bullrings throughout the country where people gather to watch the spectacle. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "noxious" suggests something harmful or poisonous, which would not be associated with perfume, carafes, fountains, or oceans. A swamp, however, is often characterized as containing stagnant water that can be polluted and noxious.
The sentence suggests that the person is getting food, which implies that they are likely in a grocery store or market. In such a setting, a tote bag would typically be placed in a shopping cart to carry items. The other options, such as between two legs or in a house, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Hammers are traditionally made with a metal head and a wooden handle. The wooden handle provides a comfortable grip for the user and helps to absorb the shock of the striking force. Other materials like plastic, stone, or soft materials would not provide the same durability or practicality as a wooden handle. "Toolbox" is not a material and doesn't make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is overly concerned about their appearance in relation to a specific date. Going for a haircut would be a logical action to improve one's appearance for the date. The other options may also be related to improving one's appearance, but going for a haircut specifically addresses the concern of the person putting too much stock in the date.
The context of the sentence suggests that the individuals were skipping stones, which typically involves finding flat, smooth stones to throw across a body of water. The options driveway and gallbladder have no connection to this context. Quarry could potentially be a source of stones, but it is unlikely that the individuals would be skipping stones there. Therefore, the most logical options are river bed or creek bed, as these are natural locations where one might find stones suitable for skipping.
The sentence suggests that the person is unable to afford their home, which implies that they are facing financial difficulties. Living in poverty is a common reason for being unable to afford a home, and is therefore the most likely answer. Schizophrenia and deception do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, while bad feelings are not a specific enough reason for not being able to afford a home. Wealth is the opposite of living in poverty, and is therefore not a viable answer.
The sentence suggests that the friend is a professional musician who earns a living playing trumpet. Among the choices, an orchestra is the most likely place for a professional trumpet player to work as it typically has a full range of brass instruments, including trumpets, and performs a wide variety of music genres. A music shop is unlikely to provide enough income for a professional musician, and a brass band or high school band may not have enough budget to hire a full-time trumpeter.
The sentence suggests that there is a stadium where men once fought with spears, which is a reference to ancient Rome's Colosseum where gladiators fought. Rome is the only option that is historically associated with this type of activity, making it the correct choice. The other options are not connected to any historical context of men fighting with spears in a stadium.
The sentence suggests that waiting in a queue for a long time can lead to a feeling of impatience, which is a common response to prolonged waiting. The other options also relate to waiting but do not necessarily reflect the negative emotions that can result from waiting for an extended period of time. "Will have to wait" suggests acceptance of the situation, "daydreaming" indicates a distraction from the situation, and "angry" implies a stronger emotional reaction than just impatience.
The question is asking specifically about the location of anemones off the eastern U.S., suggesting that they can be found in a certain habitat. The options "game preserve," "South Pacific," and "sea water" are not specific to the eastern U.S. region, so they can be eliminated. Anemones are known to live in both freshwater and saltwater environments, but the option "interidal zone" refers specifically to the area between high and low tide levels, where anemones are commonly found. The option "Atlantic Ocean" is geographically relevant and could be a slightly tempting option, but it is not as specific as the intertidal zone, which is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the uncle is the eldest and the closest living connection to something, and that the stories he tells are enjoyable to the person/people listening. The option "older generation" best fits this context, as the uncle is likely the eldest in his family and is therefore the closest living connection to the older generation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The correct spelling of "aunt's house" should also be noted, as it is incorrect in one of the options.
The sentence implies that talking to someone would be pointless if they are not paying attention or actively listening. The other choices, such as dry mouth or whispering, do not necessarily indicate someone is not receptive to conversation, and eye contact can even suggest engagement. Only the choice of not listening aligns with the sentiment expressed in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the reason for the opposite seasonal patterns of South America and North America is due to their location. The fact that South America is experiencing winter when North America is experiencing summer implies that South America is located in the opposite hemisphere to North America. The southern hemisphere refers to the half of the Earth that is south of the equator, which includes South America. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the location of South America.
The question asks for the emotion that a person with courage is not likely to feel in a surprising situation. Courage is often associated with bravery and fearlessness, suggesting that the person is not easily scared or frightened. The other choices are emotions that are commonly associated with surprising situations, such as shock or nervousness. Humor, while not necessarily an emotion, is also not related to the context of the question.
To dignify someone means to show them respect and honor, while to humiliate someone means to embarrass, shame or degrade them, which is the opposite of dignifying someone. Mortify, demean, and shame are also negative actions that can be considered the opposite of dignifying someone, but humiliate directly conveys the opposite meaning in this context.
The question is asking for something that could prevent someone from staying healthy, which suggests a negative factor. Options like "live long" and "happiness" are positive factors and don't fit the context of the question. "Sadness" could contribute to poor mental health, but not necessarily physical health. "Long life" is not an obstacle to staying healthy, but rather a desired outcome. "Injury," on the other hand, is a clear factor that could prevent someone from maintaining good physical health. It could lead to restricted movement, chronic pain, and other health complications. Therefore, "injury" is the correct answer.
The question is asking what skin covers, which suggests that the answer will be a noun that describes a physical object that can be covered by skin. The option "body" is the most logical and commonly known answer, as skin covers the entire surface of the human body. The other options do not make sense in the context of skin covering something.
The context of the question is related to learning about dining etiquette. Learning to set the table is a basic but important aspect of dining etiquette that children can learn early on. The other options mentioned are unrelated to learning dining etiquette, such as going to the wrong house, reading a book or watching television, or sunning oneself.
The sentence implies that the person playing the violin is doing so in the hopes of recording their music. This suggests that the person is interested in creating music, rather than simply practicing or performing for fun. Therefore, the correct answer is "making music". The other options, such as "calluses" and "playing wrong note", are not related to the goal of wanting to record music, and "audition" and "read music" could be related, but do not match the specific context of the sentence.
The other options involve relatively passive activities that may not stimulate much engagement or interaction, which could lead to boredom. Playing games, on the other hand, typically involves active participation, strategy, and creativity, which can all be engaging and enjoyable.
The sentence indicates that the country experienced a period of peace, which suggests that some effort or action was taken to bring about this state of calm. The term "peacework" is a commonly used phrase to describe intentional efforts to promote peace, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "war" or "violent," would not be likely to result in a period of peace. "Happened" and "trying" are vague and do not provide a clear explanation for how the period of peace was achieved.
The sentence suggests that Billy is grooming himself to look good for the dance, but he can't find his comb. Therefore, he rushes to the store to "prepare" himself by buying a comb. This makes the most sense in the context of getting ready for an event. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the blower is being used to remove snow, which is typically found on the ground. The other options (Canada, mountains, surface of Earth, Yukon) are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any clues as to what the blower might be used for.
The sentence states that cows were lost in the city and didn't enjoy the noise, indicating that they were out of their natural environment. Cows are typically associated with rural areas, such as farms and the countryside, where they have more space to roam and are surrounded by familiar sights and sounds. The other options are not directly related to cows or their natural environment.
The word "sorority" suggests that the two friends are part of a female Greek organization on a college campus. In this context, it is likely that the "fraternity house" option is the correct answer as it is a common location for college parties and drinking. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, as a wedding, friend's house, and school are not typically associated with Greek life partying. While a bar could be a possibility, the mention of a fraternity house suggests a more specific location.
The presence of wings on a helmet likely refers to a symbol commonly used to represent pilots or aviators. This suggests that the person who wore the helmet may have been a trainee or a graduate of a flight school, where they would have learned how to fly planes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
An excavation site is a place where archaeologists or construction workers dig into the ground to uncover artifacts, fossils, or other buried materials. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the fact that the site is located under the ground level. "Under ground" is the only option that accurately describes the physical location of an excavation site. The other choices either refer to different types of locations (e.g. desert) or do not accurately reflect the fact that an excavation site is located beneath the surface (e.g. work area or working ground).
Basements are typically associated with larger spaces, but the sentence suggests that there are some basements that are small. Of the options provided, the only one that commonly has small spaces is a closet. Churches, office buildings, and art galleries are all typically larger spaces, while owning a house does not provide any context for the size of the basement.
Birthdays are typically associated with celebrations and making someone feel special. It is a day to acknowledge and celebrate the person's existence and accomplishments, so the correct answer is "feel special." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the alcoholic was attending a meeting where alcohol was not permitted. Therefore, they likely brought their flask with them to the meeting room. The other options (science lab, laboratory, coat pocket, chemistry lab) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When selecting items for a baby, safety and comfort are key factors. Soft items are typically safer for a baby because they are less likely to cause injury or harm. Sensible is the best option because it is practical and reasonable, and soft items are generally considered sensible choices for infants. The other listed options are not appropriate for a baby's needs and are not related to the requirements for an infant's safety and comfort.
The sentence suggests that the business man had a meeting that required him to bring a fancy leather item with him (most likely for a professional appearance). The fact that his small child got marker on it implies that it was something that could easily be accessed by a child, which rules out options such as a drawer or desk. Of the remaining options, "briefcase" is the most commonly associated with a professional meeting setting. "Medium" and "office supply store" do not make any sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the decision to give up on the goal of gaining more land was motivated by financial considerations, specifically that the endeavor was not profitable. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Going to war, pride, higher taxes, and more responsibility may all be reasons to give up on a goal, but none of them are directly supported by the information given in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the general is looking for a hill to survey the battlefield. The word "only" implies that there is only one hill in the area that will provide a vantage point for the general. A mountain is a larger and more imposing landform than a hill and would provide a more strategic and commanding position. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they either have no connection to the landscape or are contradictory to the desired objective.
The options "school," "space shuttle," "trunk," and "stalk" are not logical places to obtain a radio. "Shop" is the only option that makes sense, as radios are commonly sold in stores.
The sentence specifies that the person is looking to make clothing out of tweed, which is a type of fabric. Therefore, it makes sense to look for a fabric store where they sell a variety of fabrics, including tweed. The other options, such as clothing stores or Eddie Bauer, may sell clothing made out of tweed, but they may not have the specific fabric available for purchase. Additionally, buying online may be an option, but it may be harder to confirm the quality and texture of the fabric without seeing it in person.
The sentence suggests that the installers were moving benches and installing new carpet, which is a common task in churches where seating arrangements are often fixed and carpets may need to be replaced due to wear and tear. The options such as office, building, playground, and bowling alley do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they may not necessarily have fixed seating arrangements or require carpet installation.
Anger is often associated with negative consequences, such as causing harm to others either verbally or physically. Expressing anger can lead to arguments or fights, hurting relationships with others, and ultimately causing pain to both the person expressing their anger and the people they interact with. On the other hand, the other choices such as happiness, tears, and suffering are not inherently harmful to others. Punishment may cause harm, but it is not an emotion.
The sentence implies that James spent time reflecting on what he had learned, which suggests that he was looking to gain a deeper understanding or insight into the subject matter. The other options do not align with the purpose of reflection or contemplation.

The context of the sentence suggests that the person is working in public transportation and has come across a locked door. This could be something that they encounter at a bus terminal, where there may be various rooms or areas that require restricted access for safety or security reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the speaker wants to turn an idea into a tangible reality, indicating that they need to take action to make this happen. Working hard is often crucial in turning ideas into reality, as it requires effort and dedication to see a project through to completion. The other options may be important in the process, but they do not necessarily convey the same sense of action and effort that working hard does.
The phrase "people love to play there" suggests that the soccer field is most likely located in a public space that is easily accessible to the community, such as a park. The other options, such as country, countryside, and near, do not provide enough information to determine the location of the soccer field. Town could be a possibility, but it is less likely than park because not all towns have public sports facilities.
The use of the phrase "opens up" suggests that the plant is experiencing a physical change, which is commonly associated with blooming. Photosynthesis refers to the process of sunlight being converted into energy by the plant, but does not involve a physical change in the plant. Having roots is not related to the process described in the question, nor are flower petals or springtime specifically mentioned.
The sentence suggests that there is a need for more physical space, which is typically associated with a larger living area such as a house. The other options do not make sense in the context of needing more physical space.
The sentence suggests that the person is taking a long walk, which implies an outdoor activity. A suitcase or department store would be too cumbersome to bring on a walk, and a mall is not a place to store clothing during a walk. A purse is too small to store clothing. A backpack, on the other hand, is a common item used for outdoor activities, and is often used to hold extra clothing, water bottles, and other necessary items.
The question is asking about what happens to family members after death, which implies a physical process of handling their remains. The choices "sadness", "laughter", and "rebirth" do not relate to this physical process. "Decomposition" does describe what happens to the body after death, but the context of the question suggests a more cultural or social response to death. "Burial" is the most logical answer because it specifically refers to the process of laying the body to rest in a burial plot, which is a common cultural practice for handling the remains of loved ones after death.
The word "dust" suggests that the object in question is a surface that collects dust, such as a shelf. The other options, such as a coffee shop, fridge, or library, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A table could potentially be a surface to dust, but it is not specific enough in this case.
The sentence indicates that Sally searched in the places where she typically eats, and also in storage areas, so it is unlikely that she found the saltshaker in a restaurant or somewhere outside of her own home. The fact that she found it wedged beside a counter suggests that it was not in a kitchen cupboard or cabinet, but rather somewhere more out of the way.
The sentence is referencing the act of buying, which involves exchanging money or some other form of payment for an item. Therefore, the correct answer is "using money." The other options involve negative consequences, such as feeling guilty or losing money, that are not necessarily inherent in the act of buying something.
Rigor mortis is the stiffening of the body after death, which typically sets in within a few hours and lasts for a few days. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Unable to work" is not relevant to death, "change color" is too vague, "change of color" is grammatically incorrect, and "would cease to exist" is too extreme and does not address what would happen to the body specifically.
The sentence implies that the subject had a passion for playing the violin, which is a key component of being a musician. The other answer choices do not capture the same level of dedication and commitment that being a musician entails. "Inspiring," "like music," and "tune" may be related to music, but they do not necessarily indicate a desire to actively engage in creating or playing it. "Make music" is too broad and does not specify the subject's particular interest in the violin.
The sentence suggests that the man needed a larger space to store his belongings, which implies that he needed more than just a small or temporary option like a dumpster or an attic. A building could be too broad of a term to describe what he specifically needed to rent. Michigan is not relevant to the context of the sentence. A warehouse is a commonly rented storage space that would fit the given context of the sentence.
Making bread can be a fulfilling and satisfying task, as it involves creating something from scratch and seeing the final product come to fruition. The word "gratifying" implies a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment, which matches the idea of making bread. The options "pride" and "adept" suggest a level of skill or mastery, but do not necessarily relate to the enjoyment of making bread. "Mess" and "allergic reactions" have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of the question.
Warming up before exercise is important in order to prevent injury and improve performance. Jogging is a common warm-up exercise for athletes because it increases blood flow, raises the body temperature, and prepares the muscles for more intense activity. Sprinting, running fast, and competing are all more intense exercises that would come after warming up. Using a heater is not a common way for athletes to warm up their legs.
Bees are commonly found in herb gardens, as they are attracted to the nectar and pollen produced by the plants. Herb gardens provide a rich source of food for bees, making them a natural habitat for these insects. The other options do not make as much sense, as bees are not typically found alone, in storybooks, in the sky, or in the great outdoors.
The question is asking about achieving happiness in a group, which suggests that the answer should be something that involves interaction with others. Singing and playing games can be social activities that may bring happiness, but they may not be suitable for everyone. Fiddling and jumping up and down are not commonly associated with group happiness. Therefore, the answer "live life" makes the most sense as it is a broad statement that can cover a wide range of activities that can be enjoyed with others.
Trashcans are designed to hold and collect waste, making them the appropriate place to throw garbage. The other options mentioned do not have clear connections to the context of waste disposal. "Outside" could refer to various locations, some of which may not be appropriate for garbage disposal, such as public areas, bodies of water, or other environmentally sensitive areas. "Television" and "ground" are not related to waste disposal at all. "Landfill" is a location where waste is disposed of, but it is not where individuals typically throw their garbage directly.
The sentence suggests that the action being described is commonly associated with relaxation. Eating whales for breakfast and eating trash do not make logical sense and are not commonly associated with relaxation. Having friends and hugging may be enjoyable activities, but they do not necessarily imply relaxation. In contrast, listening to music is a common activity associated with relaxation because it can help to slow the heart rate, reduce stress, and promote a sense of calm.
The sentence suggests that Gill was driving a car and needed to go back for something he forgot. Putting the car in reverse would allow him to back up and return to the previous location, while the other options do not make as much sense in this context. "Backwards" and "back and" are similar to "reverse" but are not specific to driving a car. "Straightforth" and "race" do not make any sense in this context.
A yarmulke is a head covering worn by Jewish men as a sign of respect and submission to God. It is traditionally worn during prayer, Torah study, and other religious rituals. The other options in the choices (demonstration, concert, garage, bus stop) are not typically associated with religious practices or customs, so they can be eliminated as potential answers. This leaves the option of synagogue as the logical choice, as it is a place of worship for Jews where a yarmulke would be appropriate to wear.
The sentence suggests that Suzan is not joining in on the wild fun that Johnny, Jerry, and the others are having. The phrase "fiddling while" implies that Suzan is playing music, while the others are engaged in a more physical activity. The phrase "wild fun" suggests that they are not doing a traditional dance like square dancing, but rather moving about in a less orderly way. "Shuffle," "troubles," and "discovery" do not fit the context of the sentence.
Front yards are usually small in suburban areas because houses are typically built closer together in suburban neighborhoods than in rural areas, which means less space for front yards. Gardening, slip and slides, grass, and neighborhood are not likely to directly affect the size of a front yard.
The sentence suggests that news and reality shows are not works of fiction, which means they are based on real events or people. Fiction refers to made-up stories, while news and reality shows are supposed to present real-life situations. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not directly relate to the nature of the programs.
The sentence suggests that the person is applying for a job and making a promise to the manager. Promising to work hard is a common expectation for job interviews, as it shows the applicant's dedication and commitment to the job. The other options, such as frustration or stress, do not make sense in the context of a job interview. Overtime may be expected in certain jobs, but it would not be a promise made during an interview. Employment is also not a promise as it is the goal of the job application process.
The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with cleaning house for only a short time. The option "exhaustion" and "tiredness" may seem plausible, but the sentence does not provide any evidence to support these choices. However, the sentence specifically mentions "sneezing," which could be a result of stirring up dust or allergens during cleaning. Therefore, "sneezing" is the most appropriate choice. The option "order" and "make money" are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that people experience different emotions during the day, which is commonly associated with feelings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that dead trees have a common behavior or characteristic, and the answer choice that best fits that behavior is "fall down." Dead trees are often weakened by rot and decay, which can cause them to become unstable and eventually fall over. The other answer choices do not accurately describe the behavior of dead trees.
The question is asking about a common bedtime routine for children. Hearing stories before bed is a widely recognized tradition that many parents use to help their children relax and prepare for sleep. Play games, push ups, play with toys, and throw things are all activities that are less likely to promote relaxation and sleep, so they are less likely to be a common occurrence before bedtime.
Jogging is a high-impact exercise that requires cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength. Someone who is not used to this type of exercise may experience exhaustion due to their body not being accustomed to the physical demands of jogging. Better fitness, shortness of breath, and weight loss are potential positive outcomes of regular jogging, while blisters may occur due to improper footwear or friction between the skin and clothing.
Glasses are typically associated with reading or working on a computer, which are activities that are commonly done in an office setting. While glasses may also be used at home or during a meeting, these options are less specific and less likely to be the primary setting where people need glasses. Cabinet and cupboard are related to storage and have no clear connection to the use of glasses.
The sentence implies that there is a danger to the trees due to the drought. One of the most common dangers for trees during a drought is the risk of wildfires or burns. This may occur because dry conditions can cause trees to become more flammable and susceptible to fires. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James was able to mentally create or visualize things that he wanted, which is commonly associated with forming images in one's mind. The phrase "play tricks on" and the word "hatred" have negative connotations and do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The word "tended" does not fit grammatically and "form thought" is a less likely choice compared to "form images" due to the specific mention of visualization or imagination in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when Jimmy and Tim play for a long time, they eventually have to stop because of a physical need- hunger. Learning and growing up are not physical needs that would cause them to stop playing, and injury seems unlikely since it is not mentioned in the sentence. Feeling happy is also not a clear reason for them to stop playing, as happiness would not impede their ability to continue playing.
The question is asking for a type of apple that people prefer, which suggests that the answer should be related to taste or flavor. Good to eat is a common phrase used to describe apples that taste great, while crisp could also be a correct answer as crispness is often associated with freshness and good taste. However, grocery store, good for, and farm do not necessarily relate to taste and are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person is creating something out of clay using their hands, which means they are likely sculpting or molding the clay. The phrase "more like" suggests that the person wants to make the clay resemble something else. The only option in the choices that could be related to this is "cup chin." This could mean that the person is trying to sculpt a cup and wants to create a lip or an indentation that would be similar to a human chin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a rule or guideline that members of the flock should be following, but many forget it. The phrase "on god can" indicates that the rule may involve God or religion. The phrase "judge men" is a common belief in many religions, stating that only God has the right to judge people for their actions or behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person is looking to acquire a ball, which is a piece of sporting equipment. Therefore, the most likely option for obtaining a ball would be a sporting goods store, which is a retail establishment that specializes in selling sporting equipment. The other options may be places where balls are commonly used or found, but they do not necessarily provide a means for obtaining one. Cuddle is not a relevant option as it has no connection to the context of the question.
Speaking words is the most common form of communication amongst humans. This is because verbal communication allows individuals to exchange information and ideas with one another in a relatively efficient and precise manner. While dancing together and fighting can be forms of non-verbal communication, they are not as widely used as speaking words. Owning cars and believing in god are not related to the question of how people communicate.
The word "greed" suggests an excessive desire for something, in this case, energy. "Get" is the only option that makes sense in the context of an individual who has a strong desire for energy, as they would want to obtain as much energy as possible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that waiting for an appointment can lead to a negative emotion, and the word "boredom" is commonly associated with waiting in a situation where nothing is happening. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "impatience" might be a close runner-up, but it implies a different emotion than "boredom" and therefore is not the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the place being described is not a natural habitat for sloths and that it may be illegal to keep them there. Basements and bedrooms are both indoor locations, but basements do not typically have restrictions on keeping animals. The universe is not a physical place on Earth where sloths could be found, and tropical jungles and Amazonia are natural habitats for sloths. Therefore, the correct answer is bedroom.
Gasoline is typically sold at gas stations, which are specifically designed to supply fuel to cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Power mowers and boats may use gasoline as a fuel source, but they would need to purchase it from a gas station (or other retailer) in order to obtain it. Refineries and oil rigs are production facilities that are involved in the extraction and processing of crude oil, but they are not typically associated with the retail sale of gasoline to end-users.
The sentence implies that meteorologists did not predict or forecast the storm, as it came as a surprise. The weather report is the document or broadcast where meteorologists communicate their predictions and warnings, so it is logical to assume that they did not mention the storm in the report. The other options do not provide any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the teacher is interested in more than just the answer and work shown. In this context, it is likely that the teacher wants the students to reflect on their work and evaluate their own progress. This will help them identify areas where they need to improve and continue on the path of growth and development. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The act of selling a house can be a stressful experience for many homeowners as it involves numerous tasks such as preparing the home for sale, marketing the property, and negotiating with potential buyers. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence, as walking or relaxing are not commonly associated with the process of selling a house, while spending money may be an aspect of selling a house but not a feeling that the homeowner would have.
The question is asking about a developmental milestone that happens prior to a baby being able to talk. While the choices "boy or girl" and "ride a bike" are not relevant to the question, the other choices allow for some analysis. "Talk nonsense" and "begin to talk" both suggest that the baby is starting to speak, which is not what the question is asking. Therefore, "learn to speak" is the best answer, as it describes the stage prior to the baby being able to talk in a meaningful way.
The sentence suggests that the host needed an extra table to accommodate all the guests, which indicates that the main dining area was not enough. The living room is a common area in a home that can easily be converted into a dining space, making it a practical option for setting up an extra table. The other options, such as the hall or card room, are less likely to be used for dining purposes.
The sentence suggests that the older gentlemen enjoyed outdoor activities, specifically on clear warm days. Chess is a game that can be played outside, and parks are a common location for people to gather and play games. Retirement communities or libraries may have outdoor spaces, but they are not specifically identified as locations for outdoor activities like a park would be. A pool or cabinet do not seem like appropriate locations for playing chess.
The use of the word "oath" suggests that the person is being sworn in to some kind of official or formal position, and that they are making a solemn promise to uphold certain values or principles. In this context, it is likely that the correct answer is "truthful," as taking an oath typically implies a commitment to honesty and integrity. The other choices, such as "not fib" and "not lie," are synonyms for "truthful," but they are not as formal or specific to the context of taking an oath. The options "sense of duty" and "think" are not related to the concept of taking an oath.
The sentence suggests that reading the manual after buying a product has a specific benefit. It implies that the manual contains information that will allow the reader to better understand the product and how to use it. Therefore, the answer is "understand details." The other options do not fit the context and are not related to the purpose of reading the manual.
The sentence suggests that the narrator was sitting on a couch and enjoying something, which is most likely a form of entertainment that can be viewed on a television program. The fact that the narrator was discussing the behaviors of a gazelle indicates that they were likely watching a nature program on television. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that using hands is a method of communication, which is commonly associated with sign language. Sign language is a visual language that uses hand gestures, facial expression, and body language to convey meaning. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that playing the bugle is a significant part of a particular group, and the context of the question points towards a military context. A military band is a group within the American army that plays music during military ceremonies, and playing the bugle is a traditional part of that role. The other choices do not fit with the given context and do not have any clear association with bugle playing.
Einstein's famous equation E
The sentence suggests that the subject of discussion is what a farmer does. "Produce food" is the most appropriate option because it encompasses both livestock and crops. "Raise crops," "grow corn," and "plant seeds" only refer to the cultivation of crops whereas "can produce" implies the preservation of food rather than its creation.
The phrase "a couple forever" suggests a committed and long-term relationship that is formalized in some way. In most cultures, marriage is the formalization of a committed relationship, and the other options do not fit the context of the question. Additionally, communication is an important factor in maintaining any relationship, but it is not the specific action that would make a relationship last "forever."
The context of the sentence implies that the object being considered is likely to be made out of a wooden rod. Brooms and old clocks are often made with wooden handles or parts, and old houses might have wooden beams or framing. A broom closet may also have a wooden handle, so it is less likely to be the correct answer compared to hardware store. A hardware store is a place where tools, equipment, and building materials are sold, not an object made out of a wooden rod, so it is the least likely answer.
Victoria is the capital city of British Columbia, which is a province located on the west coast of Canada. The other options are not located in Canada and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that starting work after it is too late can have negative consequences, which may cause someone to feel panicked. Deadlines may also be a consequence of starting work too late, but the sentence specifically mentions what could happen as a result of beginning work late. Accomplishing and momentum are not negative consequences, and sitting down does not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker doesn't get much crab where they live in a rural area. Among the choices, only "fish market" is a viable option as it refers to a place where seafood, including crab, can be bought. The other options are either specific geographic locations or vague terms that do not relate to the context of the sentence.
Balconies are commonly found in theaters and opera houses, where they provide an elevated view of the stage. Concerts are typically held in open-air venues or indoor arenas without balconies. New Orleans and Michigan are locations, but do not provide any information to indicate where someone could watch a show from a balcony.
The sentence states that the child was curious about something, which implies that he had a desire to know or learn more. Asking questions is a natural and common way for children to satisfy their curiosity and gain knowledge about the world around them. The other options do not relate to the idea of curiosity or seeking knowledge.
The context of the sentence suggests that the couple is excited about the good weather and is looking forward to engaging in an outdoor activity. While some of the other options may involve being outside, hiking specifically involves walking through nature, which is likely what the couple is excited to do. The other options do not necessarily require good weather to enjoy or do not involve being in nature.
Browning meat is a common technique used when preparing meat on a stove. This involves cooking the meat over high heat until it develops a brown crust on the outside, which helps to seal in the juices and adds flavor to the dish. The other options do not relate to cooking meat specifically or do not make sense in the context of cooking.
The question is asking about a key aspect of child development, specifically the point at which a child moves away from purely imitating and following others and starts to assert their own independent thinking. This is a critical stage in cognitive development and is closely linked to the formation of opinions and beliefs. The other choices, such as 'grow up' and 'become adult' are more general, and do not specifically relate to this developmental milestone. 'Set table' and 'gather flowers' are activities that may or may not be related to child development, but they do not specifically relate to the stage of development the question is referring to.
The sentence suggests that James went to a nearby location for food because his own food was contaminated. Since the nearby location is across the street, it is most likely a neighbor's house rather than a more distant location like a military base or fairgrounds. The other options such as garage and table do not make sense as places to get food.
In the sentence, it is stated that the oven was turned off and left open. This indicates that the oven was being allowed to cool down after use. Leaving the oven open after turning it off helps to speed up the cooling process and prevent residual heat from heating up the surrounding area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking about what the student will have to do specifically "on the test." This indicates that the answer should relate to a task or activity that is commonly associated with taking a test. "Answer question" fits this criteria, as tests often require students to answer a series of questions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Steve found an underground map unexpectedly while he was shopping for items that are commonly found in a supermarket. Therefore, the most likely answer is that he found it in the supermarket. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the person is waiting for a ride that will arrive on rails, which is a common feature of metro stations. The other options do not involve rail transportation, and therefore do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A cash register with a limited items line typically indicates a small business with a limited inventory. Candy stores often have a smaller selection of items compared to supermarkets or toy stores, which may explain why they would use a cash register with a limited items line. Bookstores and shops may have a larger inventory of items, and the context of the sentence does not provide enough information to indicate a clear connection to a specific type of retailer.
The sentence mentions that the travelers encountered toll roads while on a road trip through New England and "other parts" of a certain region. The only option that refers to a geographical region is "eastern united states", which includes states like Connecticut and New York that are part of New England. Florida and the sea are not part of the same region mentioned in the sentence.
The question asks for a location to move furniture, which suggests that it needs to be placed somewhere accessible and usable. Of the given options, only "room" fits this description, since storing the furniture would mean it's not in use, placing it on a rug is not a specific location, putting it at a friend's house is not practical, and moving it online doesn't make sense.
Soups can be made with a variety of ingredients, but chicken is one of the most common and popular ingredients used as a base for soup broth. This is because chicken is a versatile and flavorful ingredient that can be used in a variety of soup recipes. The other options (ocean, puddle, glass) are irrelevant and don't have any connection to soup-making.
While any of the choices could potentially cause knee pain after jogging, the mention of a medical condition like arthritis suggests that it may be a more serious or chronic issue. Arthritis is a common cause of joint pain and can be exacerbated by physical activity. The other options, such as losing weight or feeling better, may be beneficial for overall health but do not necessarily address the specific cause of knee pain after jogging.
The word "not very good" suggests that the band's performance may be lacking in quality or skill. The word "blaring" fits with this context as it means loud and harsh, which could be a result of the sound being unpleasant due to a lack of proficiency. The other choices do not necessarily relate to the consequences of a band not being very good. Playing music, including a drummer, recording an album, and having an encore are all actions or events that could occur regardless of the quality of the band's performance.
The sentence suggests that the troublemaker is in a location where smoking is not allowed, and the most common place to sneak a smoke in such a setting is usually the bathroom. The options "playground," "hotel," "theater," and "convenience store" do not have the same association with schools and smoking restrictions.
Demonstrations are often used as a means of expressing a point of view or advocating for a particular cause. Signs stating a point of view are commonly seen at demonstrations, making this the most likely choice. Freeways, state parks, stores, and corners of two streets do not necessarily have a connection to signs stating a point of view.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is trying to communicate with someone who is nearby and can hear them. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to listening. The other options do not make sense in this context, as the speaker is not asking the listener to do anything other than listen.
The sentence implies that there is a reason why someone might not get things they need. Among the choices, "cost money" is the most logical reason. It is common for people to not be able to afford things they need, especially if they are expensive. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why someone might not get things they need. "Fall apart," "be demanding," "happen to," and "go wrong" are all related to the quality or condition of the things needed, but they do not necessarily explain why the person is not getting them in the first place.
The sentence suggests that the thing being described is not bad, but also not too good. This implies that it is adequate or satisfactory, which is the definition of "sufficient." The other options such as "excellent," "outstanding," "exceptional," and "superior" all suggest quality that is beyond adequate or satisfactory, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence indicates that the question is asking about what people in the art industry work hard to do, which is likely to be related to the creative process. While earning money and making decisions may be important aspects of working in the art industry, they are not specifically related to what people work hard to do. Having imagination is a trait that may be important for people in the art industry to have, but it is not necessarily something that they work hard to do. Producing goods may be a goal of people in the art industry, but it is not as specific as creating, which is the most logical answer given the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James took his time walking home, indicating that he was moving slowly. The phrase "at every place along the way" implies that James was stopping frequently. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest that James was standing still or dancing, which would indicate a different type of activity.
The fact that the potato plants are growing through the floorboards suggests that they are growing underground. The only option that indicates an underground location is root cellar. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "train terminals" indicates that the subject is related to trains and their operations. The use of the word "several" suggests that there are more than one terminal involved, which implies a larger system or network. The term "transportation system" encompasses all the methods, facilities and service providers involved in moving people or goods from one place to another. Therefore, this is the most suitable option among the given choices. The other options do not match the context or meaning of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a captain in the context of a ship on the sea. In this context, the correct answer would be the bridge of the ship, which is where the captain typically commands the vessel. The other options, such as military, battleship, basketball team, and cruise ship, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or to the role of a captain on a ship.
The sentence suggests that hurting someone else is being used as a means to express something, which implies that the action is intentional. Anger is a common emotional state that people might try to express through negative actions, such as harming others. The other options do not fit the context, as feeling sad, happy, arrested or suffering would not typically lead to the desire to hurt someone else.
The question is asking where you store dry food, implying that it is in your own possession. A shelf is a common place to store dry food in a home or pantry setting. Supermarkets are not a storage location for personal dry food, and neither are military bases or a neighbor's house. In the garage, dry food is at risk of being exposed to temperature changes and pests, making it an unsuitable storage location.
The sentence suggests that one of the individuals in the scenario retrieved a contraceptive from a specific location, which is likely to be a nightstand drawer. Nightstand drawers are a common storage location for small items like condoms, and it makes sense that one would be kept there in case of such a situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence makes it clear that the human is feeling cold and needs to find a place to warm up quickly. Of the choices given, "warm place" is the only one that directly addresses the need for warmth. The other options are less likely to offer immediate relief from the cold, as a nearest house or office block may not be accessible, and a school or surface of the earth would not necessarily be warm.
The sentence suggests that doing housework caused negative effects on the old man's back. This implies that the action of doing housework was physically painful for him, which is consistent with the choice "pain and suffering." The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not offer a reasonable explanation for what happened to the old man.
The sentence states that everyone in John's band plays brass instruments, which suggests that the band in question is a brass band. Brass bands are typically composed of brass instruments such as trumpets, trombones, euphoniums, and tubas. The other choices such as jazz, punk rock, and marching bands could include brass instruments, but they are not exclusively focused on brass instruments as a defining characteristic. "Annoy mom" is not a type of band.
The sentence implies that in smaller places, there are fewer needs for a bus stop. This suggests that the larger the place, the more likely there are to be multiple stops, indicating a higher level of bus traffic. Therefore, the options that are larger and more densely populated, such as urban areas and airports, are less likely to have fewer bus stops. The option "boarding bus" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, as it is not a place or location.
The question is asking for a location where one can buy a harp, which is a musical instrument. The most logical option is a music shop, as it is a common retail establishment that specializes in selling musical instruments. The other options, such as Michigan or an Irish bar, do not have any clear association with selling musical instruments, while a concert hall is a venue for performances rather than a retail store. "Create music" is a vague option that does not provide a specific location to purchase a harp.
When scientists discover a new animal, they typically want to identify its specific characteristics or unique features that differentiate it from other known animals. This includes physical traits, behavior patterns, habitat, and DNA makeup. Identifying these specific traits is important for classification and understanding the animal's role in its ecosystem. The other options do not fit the context of the question as scientists would not be interested in experimenting on a new animal just because it is discovered, or in determining whether it is "nice" or not. Additionally, plants are not relevant to the question.
Rocks are commonly found on the ground, especially in rocky areas such as beaches, deserts, and riverbanks. While rocks can also be found in mountains and mountain ranges, the options emphasizing mountains and a bridge are less likely because rocks may not be readily available in these areas. Similarly, while some forest floors may have rocks, it is not as characteristic as finding rocks on the ground in general.
The phrase "upper west side" is a reference to a specific area in Manhattan, New York City. The other options, such as Toronto, San Jose, and large city, do not have an upper west side and are therefore not logical answers. "City underground" may refer to a subway system, but it does not provide any context for the location of the landmarks the tourists were seeing.
Free trade zones are designated areas where goods can be imported, manufactured, and/or exported without paying taxes or customs duties. By building in a free trade zone, Lindy can save money on taxes and potentially increase profits. The other options do not have any clear connection to Lindy's goal of minimizing taxes.
ping a comb in a pocket is a common practice for travelers, as it allows easy access to the comb when needed. Shoes are an unlikely storage location for a comb, and a suitcase is a possibility but may be less convenient than carrying it in a pocket. Barber shops are places where one might use a comb, but not necessarily keep it, and a medicine cabinet is a storage location typically associated with personal hygiene items kept in a home or hotel room.
The word "teacher" suggests that the context is related to a classroom setting, where books would typically be shared among students. The other options are not typically associated with sharing books in a classroom. "Cabinet" and "shelf" suggest storage, while "bookbag" is usually associated with carrying books, and "desktop" is not typically used for sharing books in a classroom.
The sentence suggests that there are specific items being transported on a train, and the word "cargo" is commonly used to refer to goods and materials being transported by a vehicle such as a train. The other options are unrelated to transportation or cargo.
The sentence suggests that the activity is casual and doesn't involve any specific task or purpose. Hanging out is a common term used to describe spending time together in a relaxed and informal way. The other options do not match the context of the sentence; smoking and partying are specific activities, homework involves studying, and volunteering involves doing something productive for a cause.
The sentence suggests that broadcasting the same shows to everyone through television can potentially lead to a certain outcome. The other choices such as innovation, visual and falling asleep are irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The option "conformity" might seem like a possible answer as well, but it has a negative connotation, whereas the sentence seems to suggest a positive outcome. Therefore, "entertained" is the most appropriate answer as television is often used for entertainment purposes.
The question is asking where it is required to have a single fire extinguisher, which implies that there may be specific regulations or laws governing this requirement. A common regulation is that all boats must have at least one fire extinguisher on board. This is because boats have a higher risk of fire due to the presence of flammable materials such as fuel, oil, and propane, as well as the limited ability to escape a fire on a vessel. The other options may also require fire extinguishers, but there is no clear indication of a specific requirement for a single extinguisher in those locations.
Lint is typically made up of small fibers from clothing or fabric. Pockets are a common place for lint to accumulate, especially in clothing that sheds fibers easily or has been washed multiple times. Purses and rugs may also collect lint, but are less likely to be associated with large amounts of lint compared to pockets. Laundromats and beaches are not typically places where lint would accumulate in large quantities.
The sentence implies that the place in question is unique and perhaps even secluded or off the beaten path. Since maps generally show all known locations, including popular tourist destinations and major landmarks, the fact that this place cannot be found on just any map suggests that it is not widely known or easily accessible. The other options do not provide any clear clues to help determine the correct answer.
The question suggests that making friends with someone of the opposite sex leads to a certain outcome. "Talking" is the most appropriate answer, as making friends involves getting to know someone and communicating with them. "Falling in love" could be a possibility, but it is not always the case and is not the most common outcome when making friends. "Smiling" is a friendly gesture but does not necessarily imply a deeper connection. "Shake hands" is a formal greeting and is unlikely to lead to a friendship. "Punch in the face" is aggressive and does not fit the context of making friends.
The use of the word "murder" suggests that the person has intentionally caused the death of another person. The mention of an injection further suggests that the person is referring to the death penalty, which is a form of capital punishment in which a lethal injection is administered to the convicted criminal. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that resisting the chocolates will be a challenge for the person on a diet. The word 'hard' is often used to describe something that is challenging or difficult to do. The other options - 'difficult', 'harsh', 'severe', and 'strict' - have negative connotations that are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a need to protect the table from something that may harm or damage it, which is commonly done by placing a protective item such as a coaster. Coasters are typically used to prevent the condensation from drinks to leave watermarks or rings on surfaces, and to shield delicate surfaces from scratches or heat damage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is playing basketball and has been taught to defend the "key," which is a specific area on the basketball court close to the basket. Therefore, the answer is likely "basketball court." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "sharp teeth" suggests that the animal is a carnivore, which means they eat meat. The phrase "what for dinner" implies that the animal is figuring out how to get their meal. The option "buffalo" is a herbivore, so they wouldn't have sharp teeth to catch prey. "Fight for life" and "leave home" are not related to the idea of finding food. "Eating" is not a behavior or action, but rather a result of the animal's actions.
The sentence mentions the specific source of the food a person needs - a dairy. A dairy is a place where milk and dairy products are produced, so it would be logical for someone to get the needed food by obtaining milk from a cow at the dairy. The other options in the list do not relate to the specific context of needing food from a dairy.
The sentence implies that eating too much can cause pain, and specifically mentions stomach aches, which are commonly associated with overeating. The other options, including food, getting full, full stomach, and full belly, may be true statements, but do not specifically address the question of what kind of pain overeating will lead to.
The sentence implies that the location is a place where kids can have privacy and avoid their parents, so it is likely a secluded area in the house. The basement is typically a separate, enclosed space that is not heavily trafficked by adults, making it an ideal place for kids to hang out. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "olive" suggests that the bag is a type of military or utilitarian bag, as olive green is a common color used in military gear. Additionally, the phrase "drawstring bag" is often used to describe the type of bag issued to military personnel. The other options, such as an airport or department store, do not have any clear connection to the description of the bag.
The sentence implies that the squirrel has been able to easily access a source of food, which has resulted in it becoming plump. Among the options provided, nuts are the closest to food and are a common source of nutrition for squirrels. The other choices, such as chipmunks and rabbits, do not make sense in the context of providing food for the squirrel.
Skylights are windows installed in a roof or ceiling to allow natural light to penetrate the building. While residential buildings like houses may have skylights as well, the context suggests a commercial or professional setting, making an office building the most likely choice. A windowless room would not have a skylight, and a company is too broad of a term to make an educated guess.
The question provides context that the region being referred to lies just below the northern border, suggesting that it is located in Canada. The options given include states in the United States (Oregon, Washington, Idaho) and a province in Canada (British Columbia). Since the sentence mentions the pacific northwest, which is a region commonly associated with the upper west coast of North America, it is likely that the correct answer is the Canadian province of British Columbia, which is located just north of Washington state. The other options are located in the United States, which is not where the northern border is located.
The question is asking for the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed, which suggests they are preparing for sleep or rest. Therefore, the correct option is likely to involve the act of getting into bed. Of the choices provided, "lay down" is the option that best fits this criteria. The other options - bedsores, bed sores, sleep in, and open the curtain - do not involve the act of getting into bed and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence suggests that Bo has dirty clothes that need to be removed in order for him to put on clean clothes. This implies that the correct answer should indicate a process of removing the dirty clothes. "Take off" is the option that best fits this criteria, as it means to remove something from one's body or a surface. The other options do not involve removing the dirty clothes.
Eating food and drinking water are normal and expected noises to make while having lunch. Burping can be seen as impolite in some cultures, but it is not necessarily a sign of danger. Choking and vomiting, on the other hand, are serious health concerns that should be addressed immediately. The question specifically asks for a noise that does not indicate you might die soon, so the answer must be either eating or drinking.
The sentence mentions that Bill is looking up, which implies that he is looking at something above him. The sky is the most logical answer, as it is above ground level and is visible outside. The other options (nature, sun, rain, and ground) do not necessarily have to do with what someone sees when looking up outside.
The sentence suggests that you are jumping out of a cruise ship, which is typically in the middle of the ocean. The other options (marina, airport, stairwell, island) do not make sense in the context of jumping out of a cruise ship.
Potato chips are a common snack food item that people often keep in their homes. Storing them in a supermarket or bar would not make sense, as these types of places are intended for commercial purposes. Storing them in a toilet or motherboard would not be appropriate either, as these items are not typically used for food storage. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be pantry, which is a common storage area for dry goods and snacks in many homes.
The sentence suggests that the person is being complimentary and making trivial physical contact, which could indicate that they are trying to show appreciation, approval, or recognition for something. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Moreover, the use of terms such as "get laid" and "talk about themselves" sounds inappropriate and unprofessional, so acknowledgment seems like the correct answer.
The sentence mentions that the mustard has been opened, which implies that it needs to be stored in a way that will keep it fresh. Refrigerators are commonly used to store condiments and other perishable foods after they have been opened, in order to prevent spoilage and maintain flavor. The other options are not appropriate places to store mustard, as they do not provide a cool enough environment to keep it from spoiling.
The sentence suggests that people used to use a type of pen called a quill that was dipped in ink. The word "quill" commonly refers to a feather of a bird, which was the material used to make the pen. Additionally, historical documents often mention feathers being used for writing, further supporting the idea that feathers were commonly used for this purpose. The other options, such as peacock or porcupine, do not fit the context and are not commonly associated with writing. Calligraphy is a style of writing, not a material used for writing.
The sentence suggests that one side is winning and the other is losing and that the losers will not get to celebrate something that the winners will. The phrase "victory in war" is commonly associated with celebration, especially with regards to military conflicts where the outcome is seen as a significant achievement. The other options are too broad and not specifically related to the context of the sentence.
Bald eagles are commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which includes Washington state and northern California. Floating bridges are also a common sight in this area, particularly in the Seattle area where Lake Washington is located. This suggests that the most likely location to find a bald eagle on a floating bridge would be in the Pacific Northwest region. Canada is also home to bald eagles, but the sentence specifically mentions a floating bridge, which may be less common in Canada.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where a lot of trash accumulates and continues to increase over time. A garbage dump is a common location for this, as it is where waste is disposed of and can pile up over time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not necessarily imply a continuous and increasing amount of trash.
The context of the sentence suggests that the engineer is presenting a new invention to his bosses, and turning on the microphone indicates that he is preparing to give a speech or presentation. The option "demonstration" is the most appropriate because it reflects the action of showing how the invention works, which is the expected activity in this scenario. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not commonly associated with presenting something new or demonstrating how it works.
The sentence makes a comparison between each person and snowflakes, which are known for being unique in their individual shape and form. Therefore, the correct answer is "different," indicating that each person is distinct and not identical to any other. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the idea of uniqueness.
The sentence clearly states that Billy was a bee, and bees typically live in bee hives. The other options, such as Michigan or the United States, are too broad and do not have a direct connection to the fact that Billy was a bee. Similarly, orchards and apiaries may be places where bees are present, but they do not specifically describe where Billy lived.
When you're standing in line for food, the natural next step would be placing your order. "Wait turn" is too generic as it doesn't specify what you're waiting to do, and "pay" would come after you order. "Frustration" and "pain" are not actions, and don't make sense as answers to this question.
Dentist offices are often found in areas that have a high concentration of residential homes, which is typically the case in suburban areas. The other options listed are less likely to have a high concentration of residential homes and are generally not associated with homes and businesses that would require dental services.
The sentence suggests that the dentist's office is located in an unconventional or unexpected place, which makes the option "candy shop" less likely since dental offices are not commonly found in candy shops. "Medical center" is a reasonable option, but the sentence specifies that the office is in a "strange place," which does not necessarily describe a typical medical center. "Town" and "patient" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most plausible option is "office building," as many dental practices are located within larger commercial or professional buildings.
The sentence implies that the company did not have physical stores in the area, indicating that they likely used other methods of selling. The most logical choice is mail order, as it allows companies to sell products without needing a physical storefront. Shipping goods and peddling may require some sort of physical presence in the area, and owning resources and branching out do not seem to make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that John made a mistake when he picked A, but he later found out that A was the correct answer. Therefore, John was relieved because he didn't make a mistake after all. The word "mistake" and the phrase "picked A by accident" indicate that John did not intend to choose A. The option "correct answer" is the most logical since John was relieved to learn that A was indeed the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
The social benefit of going to a party is the opportunity to expand one's social circle and meet new people. This is often a primary motivation for attending social events, as it provides an avenue for making new friends and connections. Getting drunk and having fun may be associated with partying, but they are not necessarily social benefits. Food and planning are also not typically cited as social benefits of partying.
The sentence suggests that the activity in question involves large four-legged animals running, which is commonly associated with horse racing. Race tracks are venues specifically designed for horse racing and are a gathering place for people to watch horses run. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
An auditorium is a common venue for shows or performances, where tickets can be purchased at a box office or online. A stadium and arena are typically used for sports events, while a home is not a public space to purchase tickets. An opera house may also be a viable option for purchasing tickets to a show, but an auditorium is a more generic term that can apply to different types of shows or performances.
Going fishing is typically done in pursuit of catching fish, which is often seen as the ultimate goal or reward for the activity. Getting food is a possible outcome of catching fish, but it is not the primary reason for going fishing. Wet clothes and wetness are not desirable outcomes but are often a result of being near water while fishing. Getting drunk is not typically associated with the activity of fishing.
The sentence suggests that there is a competitive situation between two people, which often creates tension. This tension may result from the desire to win or the fear of losing, which can lead to heightened emotions such as frustration, pride, or even anger. While emotions are likely to be present in a competitive situation, the focus of the sentence is on the tension that is created when two people are competing against each other. The word "encouraging" does not fit in the context of the sentence as it suggests a positive outcome.
The sentence suggests that something is happening as a result of the warming up of spring, and the phrase "spring forth" indicates growth or emergence. This makes sense given that spring is often associated with new life and growth, as plants and animals come out of hibernation and begin to bloom. The other options, such as "die" or "cause death," do not align with the idea of spring being a time of renewal and growth.
The phrase "not bad" implies that the person is at least average or above average in their work. The word "competent" means having the necessary skills and abilities to do something well, which would fit the context of someone who is not bad at their job. The other options do not necessarily convey the same meaning of being skilled or proficient in a particular area.
Subway stations are typically found in densely populated areas with high traffic, which are usually large cities. The other options may have subway systems, but they do not necessarily have stations in the same abundance as large cities.
Generally, people go to office buildings to work, so this would be the most likely answer. The other options are possible reasons for going to an office building, but they are not as general and obvious as "work." For example, "advertising company" and "project" suggest a more specific purpose. "New York" and "city" are not inherently related to office buildings or why people might go there.
The sentence suggests that the activity being referred to is a game, with one person pretending to be a cop and another pretending to be a robber. The word "play" is the most appropriate choice as it refers to engaging in recreational activities for enjoyment, which is the context of this sentence. The other options, such as "distrust" and "deception", do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to playing a game.
The sentence suggests that the subject went against their doctor's recommendation by eating breakfast in bed, which may imply that the subject was not feeling well. However, the question is asking about the subject's emotions, and the fact that they chose to eat breakfast in bed despite their doctor's orders may suggest a feeling of happiness or indulgence. The other options, such as feeling guilty, weight gain, spills, or indigestion, do not match the context of the sentence.
The context of the question is asking about where to store cold food, which typically requires a cold temperature to keep the food safe and prevent spoilage. The option "refrigerators" is the only choice that involves a cold environment, which is necessary for storing cold food. The other options are not related to the context of the question and do not provide a suitable answer.
The sentence suggests that Danny learned something disturbing about driving and statistics. The fact that "it causes" suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with driving. The choices "deaths," "car wrecks," and "may die" all relate to negative consequences of driving. However, "moving" and "using gas" do not have any clear connection to negative consequences of driving. Considering that Danny is studying statistics, it is likely that the negative consequence he learned about is related to data on car accidents, further suggesting that the correct answer is "car wrecks."
A dental office is where you would typically go to visit a dentist, as this is where most dental practices are located. The other options, such as a fair, phone book, city, or Las Vegas, do not have any clear connection to dental care or visiting a dentist.
The word "bad" in the question implies a negative or harmful action. "Ignore" and "do nothing" suggest inaction rather than actively doing harm. "Hinder" and "giving trouble" may not necessarily be harmful but can still be unhelpful. "Hurting" is the only option that clearly indicates a harmful action that does not benefit the person being hurt.
The sentence suggests that the pricing of the flooring was dependent on the quantity purchased. The word "bundle" implies that the flooring was sold in multiples or in bulk, and the more bundles you bought, the bigger the discount you received. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "end" suggests that the person wants to stop relaxing and move on to something else. Of the choices given, only "invigorating" implies a change from a relaxed state to a more active and energized one. "Feeling better," "sleeping," and "deep breathing" all suggest ways to prolong or enhance relaxation, while "stress" is the opposite of relaxation and not a desirable outcome.
When you need to send a package or letter, you go to the post office to purchase postage and have it weighed on a scale. The weight of the item determines how much postage you need to pay. This connection between weight and price is not typically made in the other settings listed in the choices.
A candy store is a place that typically offers a wide variety of chocolates, including different brands, flavors, and types such as milk, dark, or white chocolate. A box of chocolates may also contain a variety of flavors, but it is not a place where one can regularly find a wide selection of chocolate. Drug stores and movies may have some types of chocolate, but they typically do not offer a wide variety. Christmas stockings may contain chocolate, but they are not a place where one can regularly find a wide selection of chocolate either.
The keyword in the question is "classes," indicating a formal setting for learning. While it's possible to learn on your own in your living room or a music room, those options do not imply a structured curriculum with trained instructors. Similarly, "house" and "band" are too broad and don't specifically address the question of where to take classes. "College" is the best option because it's a common place to take music classes and often has specialized areas for music education.
"Fiddling" is a term commonly associated with playing a fiddle or violin at a hoedown, which is usually a lively and upbeat dance party held in rural areas. Therefore, it can be inferred that someone who is "fiddling at a hoedown" is likely enjoying themselves and feeling happy. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to dry their clothes in a space that is not a traditional dryer. They hung up their clothes and then pointed an electric fan at them, which suggests that they are in a closed space like a closet. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that when things go astray (i.e. deviate from the routine), a person finds it odd. This implies that the routine is a familiar and habitual pattern of behavior, and therefore, any deviation from it would be unexpected. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either describe something that is already part of the routine (habitual, even, expected) or imply a different meaning altogether (common).
The sentence is stating that the person goes on many vacations, which implies that they are someone who enjoys traveling. The term "vacationgoer" could also be correct, but "traveler" is a more commonly used and generally applicable term for someone who frequently goes on trips. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or are more specific terms that are not as appropriate.
Freeways are often the fastest option for driving long distances, such as traveling to an airport for a flight connection. They generally have limited access points, which means that traffic can move quickly and without interruption. The other options, such as "secret passageway" and "computer network," are not realistic options for driving to an airport.
The sentence suggests that playing frisbee is a possible activity after enjoying hot dogs, which is a common food item served at parks during outdoor activities. Playing frisbee is also a popular pastime for people to enjoy at parks. The other options such as the house, Disneyland, bowling alley, and sporting event do not have any clear connection to playing frisbee.
The context suggests that the gold was collected by pirates or sailors with a stereotypical appearance often associated with pirates (peg legs and parrots), which makes it likely that the treasure was stored in a treasure chest. This is a trope often seen in movies and literature about pirates. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person was pretending to read because they were not actually capable of reading due to illiteracy. "Illiteracy" and "illiterate" directly relate to not being able to read or write. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence - "watching TV" and "acculturation" have no relation to reading ability, while "at grade level" suggests the person was able to read but may have been struggling to keep up with expectations in school.
Annual weight checks are commonly performed by medical professionals such as doctors or nurses, which suggests that the person in question is likely going to a doctor's office. While other options such as the bathroom or post office may have scales, they would not be used for annual weight checks in the same way a doctor's office would. The other options such as music store or fish hatchery have no clear connection to weight checks or scales.
The sentence suggests that the home school's team was playing a sport, specifically basketball, and that each score brought a certain reaction from the crowd. The most common reaction to a score in basketball is cheering, so that would be the most likely answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of a sports game - sweating, having fun, and dancing are possible reactions, but not specific to a score, while pain would not be a positive reaction.
The context suggests that the question is asking about a common desire of parents. It is a well-known fact that most parents want their children to be healthy and happy as that is a crucial aspect of parental responsibility. The other options may be desirable for some parents but they do not capture the fundamental responsibility of being a parent as clearly as the option of healthy children.
The use of the phrase "without being killed" suggests that George is in a dangerous situation where any movement could result in his death. Therefore, the correct answer would involve an action that would help him avoid that outcome. Eliminating the options "lay still," "stationary," "staying put," and "be still," leaves "not die" as the most logical answer.
The sentence implies that the shower is located in a room that is commonly associated with bathing, such as a bathroom. The other options, such as a spa or hotel, may have showers available, but they are not specific to the context of a home. A motel room or locker room also do not fit the context of a home.
The sentence asks for the opposite of pain, which is commonly understood to be pleasure. Enjoyment and feeling good are similar concepts, but do not directly oppose pain like pleasure does. Agony is actually a synonym for extreme pain, so it is not the opposite.
The word "passengers" suggests that the question is referring to public transportation. While passengers can wait in a vehicle or a car, those are not typically designated waiting areas. A train station is specifically for trains and not buses. Therefore, the best option is a "bus depot," which is a designated location for buses to pick up and drop off passengers and provides waiting areas for riders.
The sentence suggests that the person was lying down in bed and then did something before standing. The most logical thing to do before standing from a lying position would be to sit up first. The other options, such as putting on shoes or conversing with their spouse, do not necessarily require the person to sit up first. Saying "love" or thanking God might be something a person would do upon waking up, but they would not necessarily have to do it before standing up.
The sentence suggests that John doesn't enjoy watching television and is looking for something to do with his free time. The options "watch film" and "see favorite show" relate to television, which John doesn't enjoy. "Play cards" and "talking on the phone" involve interacting with others, which the sentence suggests John doesn't have available. Therefore, the most logical answer is "surf net," which can be done alone and doesn't involve watching television.
The sentence suggests that the round things are a characteristic commonly found in humans. Two arms, ten fingers, and laying eggs are not round things and are not commonly associated with humans. Living forever is not a physical characteristic and is not a commonly known quality of humans. Two eyes, however, are round and are a well-known feature of humans.
The sentence suggests that the subject is trying to figure out what course of action to take in order to complete a task or achieve a goal. Contemplation typically involves thinking deeply and pondering different options or ideas, but in this case, the end goal is to take some sort of action. The other choices may be related to contemplation or thought processes, but they do not necessarily imply a specific action or decision-making process.
The word "cheap" suggests that the book is being sold at a lower price than usual. Discount stores are known for selling products at a reduced price compared to regular retail stores, and they often have a wide selection of books available. The other options - desk, grocery shop, house, and antique store - are not typical places to buy books or to find them at a reduced price.
The sentence implies that the person was still able to continue living despite the difficulty they faced with breathing. Therefore, the correct answer is "live." The other options ("choke," "give up," "sigh," and "cough") do not fit the context of the sentence and are not relevant to the person's ability to continue living.
The sentence suggests that the housing options in the midwest are plain and lacking in interesting architecture. To find houses with more unique and appealing architecture, the best option would likely be to look for areas outside of the midwest that are known for their interesting architecture. "Countryside" could be a good option for this since it suggests areas outside of urban centers which may have more unique and interesting housing options. The other options do not provide any clear indication of where to look for interesting architecture.
The sentence suggests that grass needs water and light to survive and thrive. If it is given these resources, it will continue to grow. The other options are unlikely outcomes of healthy grass given proper resources.
Soldiers are typically associated with war, so it is logical to assume that they would be found in a place where fighting is taking place, such as a war zone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person's belief has been challenged by new information and they have had a change in perspective, which is commonly referred to as a new realization. Disappointment and wanting more are unlikely outcomes of receiving new information, while a heat wave and joy have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Joe needed to communicate something important to Marsha before she left home, but he forgot to do so. He then spent an hour "desperately" doing something, which suggests that he was under pressure to get in touch with her. Phoning would be a logical option in this scenario, as it would allow Joe to reach Marsha quickly and convey the important information to her. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question keeps all their equipment in a specific place, which is likely to be a storage area. The options "garage" and "hardware store" don't fit the context of the sentence, as they are not typically places where someone would store their personal equipment. "Tool kit" and "toolbox" suggest that the saw would be in a portable container, but the sentence specifically mentions an outdoor location, so "tool shed" is the most appropriate option.
The sentence implies that someone is expressing a negative attitude towards something they don't want. "Reject" and "detest" also convey negative attitudes, but "reject" suggests a more active action, like denying or turning away, while "detest" suggests a strong, emotional dislike. "Annoy" does not fit the sentence's context of expressing a negative attitude towards something, and "stockpile" is unrelated. "Refuse" is the most appropriate choice as it conveys a passive action of not accepting or declining something.
The context of the sentence suggests that Lisa saw a sign while driving that indicated she was near a border. This could refer to a state border within the USA or a country border if Lisa was traveling internationally. The options "street," "every city," and "countryside" do not provide any further information about a possible border. "Texas" could be a possible location if Lisa was driving on a highway in Texas, but it does not necessarily indicate she is near a border.
The sentence implies that the doctor is taking a break from their work and therefore is not likely to be found in a professional setting such as medical school or the emergency room. The choices of a nursing home or a golf course may be possible, but from the context of the sentence, the doctor is more likely to be engaged in a leisure activity on their day off, hence the option of relaxing makes the most sense.
An injured soldier is most likely to be found on a battlefield, where they would have been engaged in combat. The other options do not make sense in the context of an injured soldier, as they are either modes of transportation (helicopter, armored car) or a political location (White House).
A yard is typically a part of a property, which refers to a piece of land that is owned by an individual or entity. A subdivision is a type of real estate development where a large piece of land is divided into smaller lots, each of which may contain a property with a yard. A neighborhood is a community of people who live in a particular area, which may or may not have yards. A file is a collection of documents or data stored on a computer. A city is a large urban area with its own government and infrastructure, which may contain many properties with yards but is not typically considered a part of a property in the same way that a yard is.
The question is asking for a term that describes areas that are located near highways and have been built up with infrastructure and buildings. "Subways" and "desert" do not fit this description, and "mexico" and "atlas" are not relevant to the context of the question. "Developed land" is a commonly used term to describe areas that have experienced construction and urbanization.
The word "elastic" implies that the material has the ability to stretch and then return to its original shape. The other choices, such as "rebound," "recoil," and "bounce," also imply movement or a return to a previous state, but do not necessarily indicate the ability to stretch. "Underwear" is a type of clothing and is not related to the properties of elasticity.
Getting out of bed typically refers to the act of physically leaving the bed after waking up from sleep. Therefore, the correct answer is 'awake'. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the ice in the person's mouth is causing discomfort, and spitting it out is a common way to get rid of it. The other options do not provide a logical solution for dealing with the cold sensation in the mouth.
The sentence suggests that the inspector believed the item in question was not an original work by the artist, but rather a copy. The word "unique" implies that the original artwork had particular qualities or characteristics that set it apart from other works, and therefore are absent in the alleged copy. The other options do not provide any relevant or meaningful information in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the garbage men are not properly disposing of the garbage and that it is ending up somewhere it should not be. The most logical answer to this would be on the street, as it is a common place where garbage can accumulate when not properly collected. The sewer and landfill options do not make sense as the sentence suggests the garbage is not being properly disposed of, while the other two options are essentially the same thing as a landfill.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath or providing false information in a legal setting. It is considered a serious offense and can lead to penalties such as indictment, going to jail, or mistrial. However, the question is asking about how someone might feel, not what the consequences are. It is likely that someone committing perjury would feel embarrassed or guilty for lying in a legal setting and risking the consequences that may follow. Tension and penalty are also possible emotions, but embarrassment is the most likely answer based on the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the teacher is punishing the student by not allowing them to go to recess. The word "punish" and the phrase "not allowing them to go to recess" indicate that the teacher is taking away a privilege. The word "deny" means to refuse to grant or allow something, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the action of the teacher in this situation.
The question asks about the best place to get a bicycle for a child, which implies that the focus is on finding a bike that is suitable and safe for a child. Toy stores typically specialize in selling toys and children's products, including bicycles that are designed for children. Other options like fun, street, university, and garage do not seem like appropriate places to purchase a child's bicycle.
The great white shark is most commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly along the coasts of North America and South Africa. While they can be found in other oceans, such as the Pacific and Indian, the highest concentration of these sharks is in the Atlantic. Sea World is a theme park and not a location where great white sharks can be found in the wild. The Gulf of Mexico is a warm, shallow sea and does not provide the suitable habitat for great white sharks.
The phrase "held at work" suggests that the party is related to the work environment, which implies that attending the party may be an opportunity to make new contacts or network with colleagues. While it's possible to have fun and make new friends at the party, the primary goal in a work-related setting would likely be to establish professional connections. The option of doing drugs is inappropriate and unrelated to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the man is likely in his own home when he needs to shave, which would make the medicine cabinet the most likely place for him to keep his disposable razor. A medicine cabinet is often located in or near a bathroom and is used to store personal hygiene items such as razors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
This answer can be derived from common knowledge about popular tourist attractions in America. Disneyland is known for its theme park attractions, including character meet and greets with Disney princesses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "curiosity" implies a desire to explore and discover new things, which suggests that James was interested in seeing the various exhibits at the fair. The other options do not have a clear connection to curiosity or exploring new things, and therefore are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence indicates that the individual enjoys reading and has likely read a lot. Since the options are related to the context, "learn new" is the most appropriate choice. "Travel new places" may be tempting, but it does not necessarily follow from the fact that the individual likes reading books. Similarly, "learn to read" does not make sense in this context, and "enjoyable" and "bored" are adjectives that do not relate to the sentence in any meaningful way.
The context of the sentence implies that the person is at a railroad crossing. Looking both ways before crossing a railroad is a common safety measure to avoid getting hit by a train. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "fear death." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Freeways are designed to accommodate high speeds and are often the fastest way to travel on roads. Car dealerships and car shows are locations where cars are displayed, not driven, and therefore speed is not a factor. "Superb" is not a location and is not related to driving speeds. Parking lots are typically limited in speed due to pedestrian traffic and safety concerns.
The sentence suggests that the people planning the surprise party saw a car approaching and quickly tried to hide from the guest of honor, indicating that the party was meant to be a surprise. The other options do not fit with the context of hiding and surprising someone, such as sending flowers, being sneaky, or singing.
The verb "give" implies that the answer is an action or something tangible that is presented to someone when they meet others. Out of the choices provided, only "introduce yourself" fits this description as it is a common social convention to introduce oneself when meeting new people. The other choices may factor into a meeting, but they are not directly given to someone in the same way that an introduction is.
Super computers are advanced computing machines that are typically used for scientific research, simulation, and data analysis. While they may be used in various settings, universities are a common place to find them due to the research and academic needs of faculty and students. Libraries and post offices do not typically have super computers, and while technical stores may sell technology products, they may not necessarily have super computers readily available. Large cities are also not necessarily a common place to find super computers.
Many bird species migrate to warmer climates during the winter to avoid harsh weather conditions and to find sources of food. The phrase "head south" suggests that the birds are likely to fly in a southerly direction during this time. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as it is already assumed that the birds are capable of flying and spreading their wings. Learning to fly is something that birds do as fledglings, not as adults. Flying north may be appropriate for some species during the spring and summer months, but it would not make sense for them to do so during the winter when temperatures are cold. Flying high may be an option for some birds, but it is not a necessary or distinguishing behavior for winter migration.
The phrase "procreating too much" suggests that the question is about the potential negative consequences of having too many children. "Overpopulation" is a logical answer choice, as having too many people in an area can lead to various problems such as overcrowding, resource depletion, and environmental degradation. The other options do not directly address the issue of overpopulation.
The sentence states that Sarah loves giving assistance and doesn't expect anything in return. This suggests that Sarah is a compassionate person who values helping others. The option "people helped" directly relates to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that Sarah did not enjoy driving cars, and that the traffic caused her a lot of something. Based on common knowledge and experiences, it is likely that what the traffic caused Sarah was stress, as traffic can be frustrating, time-consuming, and can lead to anxiety and agitation. The other options, such as car crashes, death, and happiness, are not likely to be connected to the sentence, as they are not related to Sarah's dislike of driving and the traffic.
A coup-de-etat refers to a violent overthrow of a government or leader, often by a group within the existing power structure. The sentence suggests that the motive behind the coup is to change society, which implies a desire for a change in leadership. The other options are not specifically related to a takeover of government, and do not make sense in the given context.
The sentence suggests that the woman has a problem with alcohol consumption, which can have negative effects on a developing fetus if she were to become pregnant. Doctors commonly advise women who are regular alcohol users to avoid getting pregnant, as it can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and other health complications for the baby. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the two people were getting hungry, which implies that they were looking for food. The most likely option from the provided choices is "eat eggs," which is a commonly available and easy-to-prepare food that can be found at many quick stops. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to hunger or the quick stop environment.
It is important to wash your hands after using the bathroom, especially after urinating, to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria to yourself and others. Washing your legs or zipping your pants would not be relevant to this situation. Flushing the toilet is also important for sanitation but does not apply to the personal hygiene aspect of the question. Eating should come after washing your hands to ensure you do not transfer any germs from your hands to your food.
The sentence indicates that the area being referred to is not just limited to the baseball stadium, but rather encompasses a larger space. The phrase "sports complex" suggests a large area that contains multiple sports facilities, such as baseball fields, basketball courts, and swimming pools. The other options, such as "peanut" or "major city," do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct.
The sentence suggests that killing people is a criminal offense and will result in some form of punishment. Going to prison is a common consequence for committing murder or manslaughter, which is why it is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity of the crime or the legal consequences.
The sentence suggests that the couple joined a club that offered both golfing and spa treatments. While health centers and resorts may offer similar amenities, the context of the sentence specifically mentions golfing as the activity the man was engaged in. Country clubs are often associated with golfing and other leisure activities, making them the most likely choice for a club that offers both golfing and spa treatments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Going into a trance is often associated with meditation, where the person intentionally enters a deep state of relaxation to achieve certain benefits such as stress reduction, heightened awareness, and spiritual connection. Going into a trance is not associated with feeling confused or having epilepsy, which are conditions that may result in an involuntary loss of consciousness. The options "nothing" and "meditate" are repetitive, and the correct answer is included in both options.
Quiet conversation implies a more intimate setting where people can hear each other without raising their voices. A friend's house is a more private and personal space, as opposed to a party or stadium where there may be loud music or cheering. Dinner may also be a good option, depending on the restaurant or setting. The water cooler is usually a public area and not conducive to private conversations.
The Blue Ridge Mountains are a range located in the southeastern United States, primarily extending through the states of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Roanoke City is located in Virginia, so that would be the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the location of Roanoke City or the Blue Ridge Mountains.
The question asks for what covers the largest percentage of the Pacific Northwest, which implies a physical feature rather than a political boundary (such as the United States or British Columbia). The Pacific Northwest is known for its dense forests and the logging industry, making "forest" the most likely answer. Washington and Oregon are two states located in the Pacific Northwest, but they are not physical features that cover the area.
The sentence suggests that people use their iPhones to cope with their sadness. While some people may cry or watch tragic films, the more common activity associated with using phones to distract from negative emotions is listening to music. Listening to music is a widely popular way to relax and improve one's mood, especially with the accessibility of music streaming services on mobile devices. The other options do not match the context of using an iPhone to cope with sadness.
The sentence suggests that Billy was having difficulty getting up from bed, indicating that he may already be lying down. The phrase "arise" typically means to stand up from a sitting or lying position, indicating that Billy was not sitting down at the time. "Fall down" and "get down" involve movement in a downward direction, which does not fit the context of the sentence. "Lay down" may be a possibility, but it is less likely since the sentence suggests that Billy was already having difficulty getting up, indicating that he was already lying down.
The word "cogitating" is derived from the Latin word "cogitare" which means "to think" or "to ponder." Thus, the correct answer is likely to be an option that indicates a process of thinking or contemplating. "Sit comfortably" and "enjoy" do not accurately describe the act of thinking. "Might understand" may suggest a possibility of comprehension but not necessarily the act of thinking. "Brain work" is close in meaning but not as precise as "think about things," which better captures the meaning of cogitating.
When a tree hits power lines, it often results in power outages. Therefore, a person would be missing electricity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a cat's nervousness can lead them to exhibit certain behaviors, one of which is mentioned in the question. Clawing is a common behavior seen in cats when they are stressed or anxious. Growling and purring are also behaviors that cats can exhibit under various emotional states, but they do not necessarily indicate nervousness. Drinking water and thinking do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question specifically asks where a lawyer would look for a rule they are governed by, which is most likely to be found in a lawbook. A lawbook contains the laws, regulations, and rules that govern the legal profession and are essential for lawyers to know and follow. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or the legal profession.
The word "excitement" suggests a high level of energy and enthusiasm, and dancing is a common way for people to express such emotions. Going somewhere, visiting a library, or attending a music festival may also be exciting activities, but they do not necessarily involve physically showing excitement in the same way that dancing does. Expressing information is also not likely to be associated with excitement.
The sentence suggests that having lunch too many times can result in a negative outcome. Since feeling full and feeling satisfied are both normal outcomes after having lunch, they can be ruled out. Also, dying is an extreme outcome that is unlikely to happen just from having lunch too many times. Digestion is a normal process after having food, so it cannot be the answer. Obesity, however, is a well-known health concern that can arise from consuming an excessive amount of food, including lunch.
Beans are commonly used to make coffee, which is a popular beverage around the world. While beans can certainly be used in cooking or boiling, these choices do not fit the context of the question, as the question is specifically asking about a drink. Food store and cooking pot may be tangentially related to the question, but they are not direct answers to what beans are typically used to make in a drink.
Ponds are more commonly found in rural areas, which are typically characterized by low population density and a high proportion of natural landscapes. Ponds may be found in meadows and countryside areas as well, but they are less common in forested areas where bodies of water such as streams and rivers are more prevalent. Therefore, it is more likely that the pond in this scenario is located in a rural area rather than the other options.

The context of the sentence suggests that James was looking for his razor, which is typically kept in a shaving kit. The fact that he also found cream and a small comb further supports this idea, as these are commonly used for shaving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Carnivals are known for offering a variety of sweet treats, including cotton candy. Cotton candy is a common carnival snack made from spun sugar that is often brightly colored and served on a stick. The other options, such as "own house," "kitchen," and "meaningful work," are not related to carnival treats and do not make sense in the context of the question. "English house" may be a red herring designed to distract the reader from the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is where one can purchase a variety of items, such as notepads, condoms, and toothpaste, all in the same place. The most likely location that fits this description is a drug store or pharmacy, which typically carry a wide range of products, including health and personal care items, and often have a stationery section. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location in question is a Bavarian town, which narrows down the options to Germany and town. Rio de Janeiro is not located in Bavaria and dance dance dance and hotel do not provide any clues about the location. Thus, the correct answer is likely town.
The sentence suggests that the doctor can prescribe antibiotics in different forms, and the question specifically asks for the type of antibiotic that might have a gel coating. Capsules are a common form of antibiotics that can have a gel coating to make them easier to swallow. The other options do not provide any information related to the potential presence of a gel coating.
A rosebush is a type of plant that is commonly grown in gardens or outdoor spaces. Flower beds and backyards are often places where people would plant rosebushes. A park or a ballpark might have landscaping that includes rosebushes, but it would be less likely that a person would plant one there themselves. "Outdoors" is too general of a term and doesn't provide enough context to determine the correct answer.
The word "analyze" implies a scientific or technical approach to examining something. The options "city hall," "anything," "fabric store," and "physical world" do not have a clear association with scientific analysis, while a "science lab" is a place specifically designed and equipped for conducting scientific experiments and analyzing materials.
A small hole is often a sign that a mouse has been in the house. Mice can fit through tiny spaces and will create small holes in walls or floors to gain access to different parts of a home. Cheese may be a food that attracts mice, but its presence alone does not necessarily indicate the presence of mice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the behavior or habits of mice.
The sentence provides information about dogs having four legs which indicates their physical ability. Dogs are known to be fast runners due to their four legs and muscular build. The other choices do not match the given information about dogs having four legs.
The sentence implies that the lamp is being placed in an area where two walls meet, which is commonly referred to as a corner. Placing the lamp on a desktop or in a bedroom does not necessarily require it to be in a corner, while placing it in an office or corner of a garden may be irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
A hardware store typically sells a wide range of tools and equipment, including saws that customers can purchase and take home with them. A tool shed refers to a small storage facility for tools, while a toolbox or tool kit would only contain a limited selection of tools and generally would not include a saw. DIY stores may also sell saws, but they typically offer a broader range of products for various DIY projects, whereas a hardware store specializes in hardware tools and supplies.
A rosebush is a type of garden plant that is typically found in well-maintained outdoor spaces, such as backyards, flower beds or parks. However, a jungle is a natural environment that is typically characterized by dense vegetation consisting of a variety of trees, shrubs, and other plants - not a typical location for a cultivated rosebush. Therefore, it is unlikely to find a rosebush growing in a jungle.
Neuroepithelium is a type of tissue that contains nerve cells and is responsible for sensory perception. It is found in several parts of the body, such as the nasal cavity, inner ear, retina, and other areas. However, the question is asking specifically which part of the body is being used to read the text if you're human. The retina is the part of the eye that contains sensory receptors responsible for detecting light and transmitting signals to the brain to interpret visual information. Therefore, the correct answer is retina. The other options are not directly involved in reading text.
The sentence implies that the person being described fits a stereotype, and that this is related to having thick glasses. This is a common association with the stereotype of the "nerd" or the "intellectual", which is often depicted with thick glasses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that going into a deep trance to purge the subconscious could have negative consequences such as loss of control. Going into a deep trance may involve letting go of conscious control in order to access the unconscious mind, which could potentially lead to a loss of control. Memory loss, closed eyes, confusion, and meditation epilepsy do not necessarily relate to the context of going into a deep trance to purge the subconscious.
The sentence suggests that people are looking for a place to sit on a couch near their own home, which typically refers to the comfort of one's own living space. The other options, such as an apartment, bus stop, den, or neighbor's house, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not imply a sense of comfort or familiarity.
The question suggests that the clip will be used while working, which implies that it is related to office or desk work. The option "desk drawer" is the most logical answer as it is a common place to store office supplies like paper clips and is easily accessible while working at a desk. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Playing sports is generally seen as a leisure activity that people engage in for entertainment and enjoyment. While winning may be an important goal for some individuals, most people play sports as a means of having fun and engaging in physical activity. Cheating is not considered a legitimate way of achieving success in sports, and running and earning an MBE are not typically associated with the primary objectives of participating in sports.
Sitting down in front of a TV is commonly associated with relaxation and entertainment. Many people watch TV to unwind after a long day or to enjoy a favorite show or movie. "Can rest" is similar to relax but not as specific to the context of sitting down in front of a TV. "Meditate" and "fart" have no clear connection to the context of sitting down in front of a TV, and "drink" could be a reason for some, but doesn't apply to everyone.
The question is asking where one can purchase sunglasses, which suggests that it is a retail location. The options "glovebox," "purse," "on your head," and "shirt pocket" are all locations where one might store sunglasses, but not necessarily purchase them. However, a drugstore is a common location to buy sunglasses, along with other items such as toiletries and medication.
The mention of going into a trance suggests a state of altered consciousness, which can be associated with sleep disorders such as sleepwalking. Sleepwalking is a type of unconscious involuntary movement that occurs during the non-REM stage of sleep, often triggered by stress or sleep deprivation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah did not believe that the subject in question should be divided, indicating that they were once whole or together. The phrase "putting together" is commonly associated with creating something whole or complete, and thus would make sense in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A bugle is a brass instrument traditionally used in military settings, particularly for communication and signaling. Army corps is the only answer choice that is directly related to the use of a bugle in a specific context. The other choices are not relevant to the question's context.
The sentence implies that pretending involves using one's imagination, as it states that "to pretend you need something special." The other options do not relate to the idea of using imagination to create a pretend scenario. A cell phone, thinking, and having fun may all be involved in pretending, but they are not necessary factors in the way that having an imagination is. Day dreaming, while related to imagination, is too narrow a term to capture the general concept being described in the sentence.
A lamp is a common accessory used for reading or working, and is usually placed on a surface that is near the person doing the task. The choices 'office' and 'bedroom' are too vague to give a clear indication of where the lamp should be placed. 'Desktop' is a similar option to 'desk' but may not be as commonly used in daily language. 'Corner' is too ambiguous and doesn't provide enough context to determine where the lamp should be placed.
The sentence suggests that Donny enjoys going up against other people in a violent context, which is often associated with contact sports such as hockey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they relate to different types of violence and conflict.
The other options, such as "outback," "neighbor's house," and "waterfall," do not typically have swimming pools. A gym may have a pool, but it is not guaranteed, and it may only be available to members. A hotel, on the other hand, commonly has a pool available for guests to use.
The term "procreating" implies that Billy and June were trying to have a child or children. The sentence suggests that the process was enjoyable, but there would be an uncomfortable end result. The option "lack of sleep" is a common issue that parents face after having a child, as newborns require frequent feeding and care throughout the night. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the couple is trying to conceive a child, which typically involves engaging in sexual intercourse. Planning to marry, communicating, sleeping in separate rooms, and dancing do not necessarily have a direct connection to conceiving a child.
Secular holidays are usually associated with taking time off work or school, so they are not typically eternal or frequent. They are scheduled in advance, so they are not unpredictable, and they are usually only observed for a short term, such as a day or a weekend. The option "time off work" makes the most sense in this context, and is supported by common knowledge about secular holidays.
The sentence suggests that Jim waited until the last minute to start his essay, indicating a tendency towards procrastination. Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing a task, often resulting in added stress and poor quality work. The other options do not have any clear connection to Jim's behavior of starting his essay late.
A dream vacation for children is likely to be a fun and exciting experience. Disneyland, a popular amusement park with various rides and attractions, fits this description. The other options, such as a zoo or a museum, may be interesting for some children, but do not typically have the same level of excitement and entertainment as Disneyland. School and toy store are unlikely to be considered dream vacation destinations.
The sentence suggests that Joe and Mac were concerned about making a significant impact in their future, as they wanted to be important. The phrase "amount to" implies that they wanted to achieve something significant and meaningful, rather than just making money or doing well academically. The other options do not offer a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest a desire to make a meaningful impact.
The sentence mentions the aorta, which is commonly known as the largest artery in the human body. The aorta originates from the left ventricle of the heart and travels down to the abdomen, providing oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. Therefore, the correct answer is heart. The other options do not accurately describe the location of the aorta.
The sentence suggests that Sam is presenting to his partners, which implies a business or work-related context. The other options, such as a theatre or movie showing, do not fit this context. A conference may be a possibility, but it is a larger-scale event, whereas a meeting is more likely to involve a smaller group like Sam's partners.
The sentence suggests that playing baseball is something that brings joy and satisfaction to children, which is most closely associated with the idea of happiness. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - sore muscles, injury, and errors are all negative consequences that may come from playing sports, while sadness is unlikely to be a common emotion associated with playing baseball.
The sentence suggests that the hair gel has an unpleasant odor, which may be a result of it being too messy. Hair gel can become messy if too much is applied, or if it is not evenly distributed throughout the hair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking specifically about what is used to wash clothes, not just any general item related to laundry. The context suggests that detergent or soap is needed to properly clean clothes, and "laundry soap" is a common term used to refer to this type of product. The other options, such as using just water or relying on time alone, are not effective methods of washing clothes.
The sentence indicates that the suspect showed little emotion during his sentencing, but did express remorse for the effects of his actions on the victim's families. "Sorrow" is a feeling commonly associated with regret or remorse, which makes it the most appropriate choice among the options given. The other options are either not related to emotions or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the creek is located in a specific area that is characterized by trees, which is a characteristic commonly associated with forests. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to lose mass, which means they need to focus on reducing their calorie intake. Eating healthy food is an effective way to support weight loss by providing the body with essential nutrients, while avoiding processed and high-calorie foods. The other options are related to general health and fitness, but do not directly address the goal of losing mass.
The question is asking for an overarching category that the world belongs to, and the term "universe" is commonly used to describe everything that exists, including all galaxies, solar systems, and celestial objects. "Galaxy" refers specifically to a collection of stars and planets, while "solar system" refers to the collection of planets and other objects that orbit around a star. "Sky" and "space" are more general terms and do not necessarily encompass everything in existence.
The sentence suggests that James was heading to another place, which implies that he was likely planning on traveling a longer distance. A duffle bag is a common type of luggage that is easy to carry, which suggests that James was not traveling by car or plane. The options "store," "sporting goods store," and "locker room" do not suggest any connection to travel or transportation. "Transit" is a more general term and could refer to any mode of transportation, but "bus station" specifically suggests someone walking to a central hub for catching a bus to their destination.
The question is asking about where a drop of blood comes out of, which is typically associated with bleeding from a wound or cut. Veins and the human body are too broad and do not necessarily imply bleeding, and a needle typically causes a controlled and intentional extraction of blood rather than accidental bleeding from a cut. A person is also too broad and does not provide specific information about where the blood is coming from.
The sentence suggests that people were able to see the moon surrounded by stars, implying that they were observing it from Earth. As the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it is not likely to have been seen from outer space, air, or the universe. The context also mentions stars, which are typically visible in the night sky. "Magic" is not a plausible answer as the sentence suggests a factual observation.
The sentence implies that the merchant needed a physical location to sell his goods, which is commonly done through a store. A business or mall may contain multiple stores, but the sentence specifically talks about the merchant building something. A house is not typically used for selling goods, and "sell goods" does not describe a specific type of building.
Sundays are typically associated with religious observance, with many people attending church on this day. The other options do not align with this context, and going to jail or staying at home may not be something one chooses to do voluntarily. Going out to eat at a restaurant or spending time with loved ones are possible options for a Sunday activity, but they do not fit the context of the question as well as attending church.
The question is asking for the closest place outside of one's own home where a grill can be found. While a backyard or neighbor's house may have a grill, they are still considered part of someone's home. A restaurant, on the other hand, is a public place where grills are commonly found in the kitchen for cooking food. Barbeque could also be a viable option, but it is relatively vague and can refer to both a cooking method and a social gathering. "These twos places are cannot be found" is a grammatically incorrect option and can be eliminated.
The sentence suggests that there are easy-to-see creatures in a city, which is a reference to a zoo. Zoos are designed to showcase a variety of animals in a confined space for easy viewing. The other options, such as forest, library, woods or black lagoon, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are unlikely to showcase a variety of animals within a city.
The sentence suggests that Sam and his friend did something to acknowledge each other's presence, but nothing specific is mentioned beyond exchanging greetings. "Say hi" is a common way to greet someone when you see them, and it would be a likely choice in a casual meeting like this one. While other options like "shake hands" or "have coffee" could also potentially happen during a meeting, the sentence does not provide enough information to support those choices. "Say goodbye" is not appropriate because the sentence implies that Sam and his friend are just starting their meeting, so they wouldn't be saying goodbye yet.
The sentence suggests that Billy wants to impress his family and the most logical option that would impress people is to make something creative like art. The other options like believing in god, leaving or coming home or going out do not necessarily imply that he would impress his family by doing those things.
The sentence suggests that John had a period of time where he was not conscious, but does not imply that he died or experienced forgetfulness. The fact that a year had passed also suggests that it was a prolonged period of unconsciousness, ruling out the options of falling down or dreaming which are typically much shorter experiences. Therefore, the most likely option is that John was in a coma.
The sentence suggests that discovering truth is a part of serious research, and it would come during a specific part of the research process. The conclusion is the logical end of research, where researchers analyze the data they collected, draw insights, and make conclusions based on their findings. Therefore, the logical choice would be "conclusion," as it directly relates to the idea of finding the truth. The other options, such as "sick," "pain," "relief," or "happiness," do not have any clear connection to the process of research.
Greed is a desire or excessive hunger for something, usually material possessions or wealth. "Get" is the correct answer since someone who is greedy wants to acquire more than they need or deserve. The other options do not make sense in the context of greed.
The sentence suggests that something external prevented the person from leaving work, and one of the choices that could potentially block someone in the street would be a demonstration. Demonstrations often involve a large group of people gathering in public spaces to protest or raise awareness about an issue, which could lead to blocked roads or restricted movement. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cacti are known for their ability to survive in arid and dry environments, making them a popular choice for people who want low-maintenance plants. Cacti are adapted to store water in their tissues, which allows them to go for long periods without being watered. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that when birds fly overhead, something unpleasant happens to Sarah. The word "covered" suggests that it is a physical substance that lands on her, and the word "loved" implies that it is not something she enjoys. The word "poop" is commonly associated with birds and is a logical choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
illing people is a serious crime that is punishable by law in most jurisdictions. The sentence suggests that there will be consequences for killing people, which will likely involve some form of punishment. Options such as vengeance and joy do not make sense in this context as they imply an emotional response rather than a legal consequence. Going to prison and going to jail are similar options that could be correct, but get punished is a more general and accurate answer that covers all possible types of punishment for the crime.
A park is a public outdoor area that people use for various recreational activities, such as walking, jogging, picnicking or relaxing. Many parks have benches strategically placed throughout the area, providing a convenient spot for people to take a break or sit down to enjoy the scenery. A state park is a specific type of park that is usually maintained by a state government to preserve natural areas, historical sites, or other features of interest. The other options do not have the same association with the presence of benches.
The sentence suggests that the lead character is confident and has a tendency to defy expectations. He then makes a quip about "every rule having its exception," which means he believes that there are always some situations where a rule does not apply. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "tearoom" is often associated with England, where the tradition of taking tea in the afternoon was popularized in the 19th century by Queen Victoria. While tearooms can be found in many parts of the world today, England is where they first became popular and are still an important part of British culture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Headaches can have many causes, including physical trauma such as a fall, mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, emotional stress such as being made fun of, and incorrect information such as a false diagnosis. However, a brain tumor is a known medical condition that can cause frequent or severe headaches, making it the correct answer to the question. It is important to consult a healthcare provider to accurately diagnose and treat any potential causes of headaches.
Borrowing sugar is a common gesture between neighbors, as they are often in close proximity and may need to ask for small favors from time to time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the contextual knowledge of borrowing sugar, such as internet or buildings. Apartments could work, but it would not be specific enough as it could be multiple apartments or complexes. End of line is not relevant to the question.
The sentence suggests that someone could give you a plate with a grape on it, which implies that it is a dish or a meal. The most likely place to receive a prepared dish with a garnish like a grape would be in a restaurant. The other options, such as a grocery store or a food store, do not typically serve prepared dishes.
The sentence suggests that the stream had not been flowing for a while due to a drought. As a result, the water levels would have likely decreased or lowered. The other choices do not capture the same sense of water levels decreasing or stopping. "Stagnant" and "stagnate" suggest that the water was not moving, but do not necessarily imply a decrease in levels. "Hold up" and "stopping" suggest a sudden cessation of flow, rather than a gradual decrease.
The context of the question suggests that the person is enjoying sunshine on the beach, implying that they are physically present at a beach. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be something that is commonly associated with beaches. One of the common features of a beach is a view of the sea, which makes it the most probable option. The other options, such as windowsill, sunbathers, disneyland, and summer, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
To listen effectively, you must first stop speaking in order to give the speaker your full attention. Continuing to speak during a conversation can be distracting and prevent you from fully understanding what the speaker is trying to communicate. While it is important to concentrate on the sounds and words being spoken, the first step is to simply stop speaking and focus on the speaker. The other options are less likely to be the first thing you need to do in order to listen effectively.
The question is asking about an action related to drinking liquids. Swallowing is the action of moving liquids or food from the mouth to the stomach through a series of muscle movements in the throat and esophagus. The other options are not related to drinking liquids. Needing to urinate is a bodily function related to excreting waste, vomiting is the involuntary expulsion of stomach contents, having fun is a subjective experience not related to drinking liquids, and sickness may be a result of drinking something harmful or contaminated, but it is not an action related to drinking.
The sentence mentions Hoboke, which is a city in New Jersey. Therefore, it is likely that the toll road mentioned is also in or near New Jersey. The other options do not have any clear connection to Hoboke or to toll roads in that region.
The question is asking about where a furnace typically heats, which suggests that it is a household appliance. "House" and "basement" are the most likely choices, as furnaces are typically located in basements or crawl spaces and heat the entire house. The other options, such as "antarctic" and "cellar," do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that a stud bull was brought in to breed with a prize winning animal, and the term "stud" typically refers to a male animal that is used for breeding purposes. Furthermore, the choice of "female" as an option implies that the prize winning animal is a female. The other options, such as "horse" and "feeble", do not make sense in the context of breeding with a bull. "Bullbleep" is not a valid option as it is not a real word.
The context of the sentence suggests that a cat is hunting for a mouse, which is most likely to be found in a back alley. Back alleys often have a lot of hiding places and small spaces where mice can hide, making them an ideal location for cats to hunt. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys nature and likes to spend time in green spaces, particularly by a pond. Parks are public spaces that often have ponds or lakes, and are commonly visited by city-dwellers for relaxation and recreation. The other options, such as forests or countryside, do not fit the context of a city setting.
The sentence describes a scenario where a hard piece of rubber, most likely a puck, was deflected off a stick and struck a fan. This type of incident is common in sports that involve the use of sticks and pucks, such as ice hockey. The use of the word "sporting event" in the answer choice suggests that this incident could happen in any sport that involves the use of equipment that can potentially fly off during play. The other options, such as living room and football stadium, do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the electricity is completely out in the house, which suggests that it is not a localized issue like a short fuse, shock, or a fire caused by an electrical malfunction. The man suspects the cause of the power outage, indicating that it is not a scheduled maintenance or maintenance-related issue that would likely be communicated in advance. The correct answer is power outage because it is the most logical and probable cause of a sudden loss of electricity in the house.
The sentence suggests that there is an action that some people do their whole life in order to show their love. The verb "wait for" implies that these people may be waiting for someone or something, which could suggest a romantic or emotional context. "Live life" and "entertain" do not have a clear connection to the idea of waiting for love, while "emotion affection" is not a grammatically correct phrase. "Kiss" could be a way to express love, but it does not fit the phrasing of the sentence as well as "wait for."
The sentence suggests that the people mentioned were wearing mouse ears and purchased balloons, both of which are commonly associated with the Disney theme parks. The mention of Southern California further supports this idea, as Disneyland is located in Anaheim, CA. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah had a desire to do something that she was not yet old enough to do. The options "marry", "dress himself", "drive train", and "ball stopped" do not fit the context of the sentence. The only option that makes sense is "drive car", as it is a common activity that requires a certain age and licensure.
The sentence suggests that John was not good at testing himself, so it would be best for him to continue doing something else instead. The most likely option is his homework, as this is a common task that students are expected to complete regularly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the location of the most authentic Japanese restaurant, which implies that the restaurant must be located in Japan. Therefore, the correct answer is Tokio (Tokyo), which is the capital of Japan and is known for having a wide variety of authentic Japanese restaurants. The other options may have Japanese restaurants, but they are not necessarily known for being the most authentic.
The sentence suggests that John did something wrong, specifically committing perjury. Perjury is a serious offense and can have legal consequences like penalties, arrests, and going to jail. However, the question asks for the emotion that John felt. Based on the context, John's emotional response is likely related to the fact that he did not like committing perjury, which indicates that he recognized it as a morally wrong act. Shame is an emotion commonly associated with feeling guilty or embarrassed about a wrongdoing, making it the most likely answer. Tension does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the story has reached the highest point of tension or excitement, which is often called the climax. It also indicates that the story is not quite finished yet, since it is only near the end. The other choices, such as "floor" or "falling down," have no relation to the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect. "End badly" might be a possibility, but it is not a sure thing based on the information given in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that officers will use a pistol to shoot deserters, which is a military term referring to a soldier who abandons their duty or post. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to military operations, and "war" is the only option that fits this description. The other options, such as "police officer's belt" and "pants," are not related to military activities.
A saw is a common tool used in woodworking and other DIY tasks. It is typically stored with other tools in a toolbox or tool kit, which makes it easily accessible when needed. While a hardware store may sell saws, it is not a place to store them. Similarly, a tool shed or storage area may be used to store larger tools or equipment, but a saw is small enough to be kept in a toolbox.
Monkeys are arboreal creatures, meaning they live primarily in trees. This makes tree tops a logical choice for where they would hang out. Additionally, the other options do not necessarily apply to all monkeys - for example, monkeys in zoos do not necessarily "hang out" but rather are kept in enclosures. South Africa and tropical areas may be habitats for certain types of monkeys, but not all. The great outdoors is too broad and could apply to a variety of animals, not just monkeys.
The sentence suggests that cats have a particular reaction when they are near water, and "be excited" is the most likely choice based on common knowledge about cats. Many cats enjoy playing with water or watching it, and some even enjoy swimming. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are unrelated to cats.
The sentence suggests that the celebration in question involves both food and games, which is a characteristic commonly associated with carnivals. Carnivals typically involve a lot of noise from the various games and attractions, which explains why the sentence mentions "plenty of noise." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking about how to satisfy curiosity about a new show, which suggests that the show is likely intended for television viewing. Using television would be a logical way to access and watch the show. The other options do not provide a clear or relevant means of satisfying curiosity about a new show.
The other options listed all suggest a setting where a formal dining area may be expected. "Coming together" could refer to events such as weddings, where formal dining is often part of the celebration. A "supper club" is a location specifically designed for dining out, often with a dress code that requires more formal attire. Cruise ships often have formal dinners as part of the cruise experience. Even in a home setting, some individuals may choose to have a formal dining area for special occasions. In contrast, a mall is not typically associated with formal dining experiences.
The sentence suggests that the soldier needed a deeper level of motivation, which is likely to come from a feeling of hatred towards the enemy. However, for the squad member, all it took was orders, indicating that they were willing to follow commands, and didn't necessarily require a personal motivation such as hatred. This makes "advance into battle" the most likely choice as it relates directly to following orders in a military context. The other options may be related to combat, but they do not match the specific context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that running in bad shoes can cause something painful, which may be a physical condition or injury. Among the choices, calluses are the most likely because they are a common result of wearing poorly fitting shoes or shoes that have worn out. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy had too much Mexican food and was unable to catch his flight as a result. This implies that he was experiencing some sort of physical discomfort or illness, which is commonly associated with overeating or consuming spicy foods. The fact that he missed his flight suggests that he was unable to leave the location where he had eaten the food, and the most likely place for him to have been stuck would be the bathroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person became intoxicated and was then sent to prison, which implies that they engaged in some form of illegal behavior. The word "arrest" relates to this idea and makes the most sense as a consequence of such behavior. The other options are not directly related or do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the term used by Joan is less polite than "servant," suggesting that it may be a more negative or derogatory term. The option "in charge" has a positive connotation, and "freedom" and "rich person" do not relate to the context of the sentence. "Free person" could be a possibility, but it does not convey any negativity. "Hired help," however, is a term commonly used to refer to domestic workers or servants, and has a negative connotation.
The sentence suggests that the cat was bothering James by persistently staying near him when he was trying to focus on his work. The answer choices that have nothing to do with being inside the house or keeping close proximity to James (like microwave, meat loaf, or outside) can be eliminated. The choices that are more likely to be indoor areas, like bedroom or backyard, suggest a closer proximity and make sense in the context of the sentence. However, since the cat is clearly annoying James and entering his private workspace, the most likely answer is the bedroom.
The drum is commonly associated with marching bands as it provides the beat and rhythm for the group to march in time to. While drums can be used in other types of musical organizations, such as rock bands or symphony orchestras, the sentence specifically mentions the "key part" of the musical organization, which implies that the organization is primarily known for its use of the drum. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James is looking for a disposable or low-quality saucer to use for cat food, which is more likely to be found in a drawer for miscellaneous items rather than a specific cabinet or tea room. The other options are either too formal or not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person wants to cheer up a group that is feeling down. Making someone laugh has been shown to have a positive effect on mood and can lift people's spirits. Socializing and meeting people may not necessarily cheer up the group if they are already feeling down, and meeting a friend is too specific and may not be an option for the person trying to cheer up the group. Telling jokes is related to making people laugh, but not everyone enjoys jokes and they may not be appropriate in all situations.
The sentence implies that whatever "this" is, it is dangerous and something that should be avoided. "Harm's way" is a common expression used to describe a situation or location that poses a potential risk or danger to an individual. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions jumping over a rope, which is a common activity in jump rope, an exercise that involves continuous jumping while swinging the rope under and over the feet. It is a popular form of exercise for children and adults alike and is considered an effective cardiovascular workout. The other options, such as headaches, broken, or fun, do not seem to have any direct connection to the context of the sentence. Getting warm could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough to be a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person is admiring an apple tree in a quiet and intimate setting. The choices "meadow" and "park" suggest open spaces that are often busy and less intimate, while "Idaho" and "Rhode Island" are geographic locations that do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Garden" is the most logical choice, as it is a small, intimate space that is often associated with trees and plants.
The context of the sentence implies that the answer refers to a type of door that is opened and closed when driving to a store. Among the choices, only "car door" fits this description. The other options may be doors found in homes or buildings, but they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the sentence mentions "oil" as a solution to fix a squeaky hinge, which is a common maintenance item for car doors.
The sentence implies that the calm seas are about to change because their sails filled, which indicates an increase in wind speed. The word "windy" is the only option that describes a change in wind conditions, while the others are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
A tourniquet is a medical device used to constrict blood flow in a limb or extremity in order to control bleeding. While it may be used in a hospital or ambulance setting, it is also commonly included in emergency kits for use in the event of accidents or injuries in remote or outdoor locations. The other options - ghetto, hospital, ambulance - are not related to the use of a tourniquet.
The sentence suggests that the person wanted to fix their car, which implies that they needed a specific part to repair it. Therefore, the correct answer is machine part. The other options do not relate to car repair and are not logical choices.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to eat outside of their own home, which eliminates the option of "own home." The word "dining room" typically refers to a space within a restaurant or hotel where people can sit down and eat their meals, which makes "restaurant" and "hotel" likely options. "Mansion" does not fit the context of the sentence and is not typically associated with dining rooms. However, there is a typo in "resteraunt", so the correct answer is "restaurant."
The question is asking about the origin of cuisine served in a Mexican restaurant. Since Mexican cuisine is characterized by dishes with flavors and ingredients indigenous to Mexico, it would make sense that the cuisine comes from Mexico itself. Tex-Mex, San Diego, Southern California, and Tijuana are all places where Mexican cuisine is heavily influenced, but they are not the origin of the cuisine itself.
The sentence suggests that the kitten is using its claws, but needs to be taught when to do something with them in order to avoid hurting others. This implies that the solution involves the kitten being able to control its claws in some way. The verb used in the sentence, "extend", suggests that the claws are being pushed outwards. Therefore, the correct answer would be the opposite action of retracting the claws, which involves pulling them back inwards. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the bad man littered by tossing his bubblegum out of his window, which would most likely land on a surface near his car, such as the sidewalk or the street. The other options, such as the theater or the supermarket, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and it would be unlikely for the bubblegum to end up there.
Maine is known for its lobster industry, and it is a popular destination for lobster lovers. The other options are not typically associated with lobster or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. South Carolina is known for its seafood, but lobster is not a local specialty. Chesapeake Bay is known for its blue crabs, but not lobster. New England is known for seafood and could be a viable option, but Maine is specific to lobster and is a safer choice. A cruise ship could be anywhere, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence mentions people in uniform training for war, which implies some sort of military training. Guns are commonly used in military training, so it makes sense that a gun would be present in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a crime scene would likely involve detectives rather than people training for war, a backyard is unlikely to have people in uniforms training for war, a police station would have officers training for law enforcement rather than war, and a police car would not be a suitable location for military training.
Suicide is often a result of severe emotional pain, commonly referred to as "misery." Other factors, such as the loss of someone or physical scars, may contribute to a person's emotional state, but they alone are not typically the sole cause of suicide. Additionally, the phrasing "kill yourself" is a problematic term that can contribute to stigma and should be avoided. The correct answer is the more appropriate and sensitive term for the underlying cause of suicide.
Drinking alcohol in excess to the point of poisoning can cause severe harm to the body, including death. Alcohol poisoning can cause respiratory depression, seizures, and a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels. Disorientation and frequent urination are also common symptoms of alcohol poisoning, but they are not as severe as the risk of death. Having sex and bad breath do not have any clear connection to alcohol poisoning.
The question is asking about what helps a human to move, and muscles are the primary body part responsible for movement. Humans have over 600 muscles in their body which work together to enable us to walk, run, jump, and perform other physical activities. The other options - two arms, drinks, stupidity, and one body - do not directly relate to the question or provide a plausible answer.
The question is asking for something that could specifically prevent someone from doing housework that involves dust. Asthma is a respiratory condition that can be triggered by dust and can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing. Fatigue, headache, and arguments are all potential reasons why someone may not want to do housework, but they do not directly relate to the presence of dust. A maid could certainly help with housework, but they are not a preventive factor in this scenario.
The sentence is discussing the basic needs of a person for survival and thriving. While breathing is necessary for survival, the sentence suggests that there are two additional things that are required for a person to thrive. The options "freedom of expression" and "freedom of information" are not basic needs for survival, and while hugs and owning a house may contribute to a person's well-being, they are not necessary for basic survival. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "food and water," which are basic necessities for the human body to function and thrive.
The sentence mentions "Mediterranean breezes," which refers to a warm climate and a specific body of water called the Mediterranean sea. Southern Europe is known for having numerous countries located along the Mediterranean coast, such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. None of the other answer options relate to this context.
A stepladder is a commonly used tool for reaching high places or accessing items that are out of reach. It is a type of ladder that has a platform for standing on and two or more steps or rungs. The most likely place to find a stepladder if you do not have one would be a hardware store, as they typically carry a wide variety of tools and equipment for home improvement and maintenance. The other options may also have ladders available, but they are less likely to have a specific stepladder designed for household use.
This question is referencing Cerberus, the three-headed dog in Greek mythology who guards the entrance to the underworld. The question is asking about a characteristic that is unique to humans and absent in Cerberus. The correct answer is "lay eggs" because humans are mammals and give birth to live young, while Cerberus is a mythical creature and not capable of laying eggs. The other options are not unique to humans and are either shared by other animals or not applicable to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that the person spends a few hours hitting the bottle, which suggests that they are consuming alcohol. Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it increases urine production, leading to a full bladder. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally was looking for a home that was close to the city, but not too far away. The suburbs are typically residential areas located on the outskirts of a city, which would make them a likely option for Sally's search. The other options do not have any clear connection to Sally's desire for a home close to a city.

Forgetting your tickets when going on vacation is likely to cause anxiety and stress, as it may prevent you from being able to travel as planned. Panic is a common reaction to such situations, as individuals may feel helpless and unsure of what to do next. Debt, peace, laugh, and having fun do not seem relevant to this scenario.
The sentence mentions "crowded," which implies a high volume of traffic. "State highway" refers to a road maintained by a state government, rather than a federal or local government. The options "of states" and "united states" do not provide any relevant information, while "american state" is redundant since the sentence already mentions a state highway. Therefore, "traffic" cannot be the correct answer. California is known for having heavy traffic congestion, especially on its highways, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that children are getting ready for an activity that they will enjoy in the future. Out of the options given, only a soccer game fits this criteria as it is an outdoor activity that children often enjoy playing. While a toy store may offer tools for play, children would not be preparing for play there. A zoo and a classroom do not suggest an activity that children would be actively playing in the future. A bathroom is also an inappropriate choice as it has no connection to playing or preparation for it.
The word "expensive" suggests that the knowledge was not something that could be easily obtained, and attending a university is often associated with high costs for tuition and fees. Universities are also known for offering in-depth and specialized education, which may require more resources and funding than other options like books or meetings. The other choices may provide access to knowledge, but they do not necessarily imply that the knowledge itself was expensive to obtain.
The use of the term "animated" suggests that the entertainment in question involves some form of animation, which is typically associated with films. Additionally, anthropomorphized talking animals are a common feature in animated films for children, which eliminates options such as forrest, mulberry bush, and outdoors. The phrase "on an adventure" also implies a narrative structure, which is another characteristic of animated films. Therefore, the correct answer is animated film.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is missing their aunt, which implies that they have a desire to see her. The most appropriate answer would be to visit relatives, which could include the aunt in question. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not logical actions a person would take if they miss their aunt.
All planets in our solar system are located in orbit around the sun. While they are technically located in outer space and the universe at large, the term "orbit" specifically denotes their path of travel around the sun. The term "sky" refers to the visible expanse above the Earth's surface and does not accurately describe the location of planets. The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our solar system but is not the location of the planets themselves.
The context of the question suggests that the answer is likely to be a place where families gather and interact. The phrase "begin" also implies that this is a starting point for a family. The option "around dinner table" is the most likely answer as it is a common place for families to come together and engage in conversation, discuss their day, and share a meal. The other options, such as a wedding or a supermarket, do not necessarily have the same association with family bonding and interaction.
Local area codes are typically associated with specific geographic regions or cities, so if a call is coming from a local area code, it is likely that the caller is located in that area or nearby. The other options (office, motel, desktop, rest area) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the use of a local area code.
The question is referring to the concept of life having a limit or an end date. The word "finite" means having limits or bounds, which accurately describes the idea being referenced in the question. The other options ("over," "good," "important," and "ending soon") do not accurately describe the concept being referred to.
The sentence suggests that the gun was not in a proper storage or carrying device, which resulted in discomfort for the person carrying it. The most logical option to alleviate the discomfort would be to put the gun in a holster, which is a device designed specifically to hold a firearm securely and comfortably on a person's body. The other options, such as a drawer, crime scene, police helicopter, and police station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "laconic" means using very few words, or being brief in speech. Therefore, the professor was not using a lot of words or being overly talkative, indicating that he was probably avoiding verbose language. The other options are all words that would describe using too many words, being overly complex, or overly dramatic in language, which is opposite to the meaning of "laconic".
Greeting someone verbally is a common practice in human interaction. While other options may be part of human behavior, such as eating or sleeping, they do not necessarily relate to the act of greeting someone. Saying hello is a common and polite way to greet someone in many cultures, which makes it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the travelers were moving away from a mountainous area, as they were no longer seeing signs warning of falling rocks. This implies that they were entering a flatter area, which is commonly associated with countryside. Volcanoes and mountain ranges would not be described as "less steep" as they are inherently steep. "Ground" and "bridge" do not logically fit in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that towels are not available in the bathroom, which suggests that an alternative method for drying hands is needed. The most logical choice among the options is a dryer, which is commonly found in public restrooms as a hand drying option. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is concerned about what the washing machine might do to his good jeans. The options 'shrinkage,' 'wear out,' 'wet clothes,' and 'torn' all refer to potential damage that could be caused to the jeans, but 'ruin' is the most severe option and would seem to best match with the person's concern.
Eating hamburgers in a sufficient amount will lead a person to get full, consume a high number of calories, and potentially gain weight over time. Additionally, consuming large amounts of red meat can cause digestive issues such as stomach aches. Therefore, all of the answer choices provided could be correct responses to this question.
The sentence suggests that leaves are sliding from a higher place (likely a roof) and ending up in a gutter. This would make sense as leaves on trees or the ground would not have the necessary elevation to slide into a gutter. A spout is also unlikely as it is usually connected to the gutter and wouldn't allow leaves to slide in. The street also does not make sense as gutters are usually located on the sides of buildings or homes, not in the middle of a street.

The sentence implies that bald eagles are not exclusive to the USA, and that they can be found in another place that is described as a "two word province." The option "british columbia" fits this description as it is a Canadian province located in the western region of the country, known for its abundance of wildlife and diverse ecosystems including coastal rainforests, mountains, and islands - all of which are ideal habitats for bald eagles. The other options do not fit the description of a two-word province, and do not have any clear connection to bald eagles.
Fear can often cause people to freeze or become paralyzed, preventing them from taking action or making decisions. This is a common response to a perceived threat or danger, and can manifest in many different ways. While fear can also motivate some people to take action or make changes, the sentence suggests that fear has a negative impact on people, specifically in terms of stopping them from doing something. The other options may also be possible effects of fear, but they are less directly suggested by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the sickness is getting better after a period of rest, which would lead to the person feeling better. The other options may be related to rest in general, but do not specifically imply an improvement in health.
The sentence suggests that the group was on a tour and the tour guide was providing information about different things. The phrase "then took the group to" implies that the tour guide was leading them to a specific destination. The option "see exhibits" is the most logical answer as exhibits are usually the main attraction of a tour and are something people would be taken to. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to a physical destination that the tour guide would lead the group to.
An emergency situation typically involves a critical medical condition where a patient's life is in danger. In such a situation, a doctor or any medical professional must perform resuscitation, which includes techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using a defibrillator to restart the patient's heart. Studying medicine, caring for patients, providing care, and performing a physical are all essential responsibilities of a doctor, but they may not be directly related to an emergency situation.
The sentence implies that the iPhone has features that can replace those of an iPod, which is a music player. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to music. Of the options provided, "play music" is the most closely related to the function of an iPod, while the others are more general features that the iPhone offers.
The sentence suggests that the problem with getting away from it all is that many people are also visiting the same place. This makes sense for state parks, which are often popular destinations for nature lovers looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. However, the other options are less likely to be crowded, especially considering that the sentence implies that many people are also visiting the same place. Disneyland, circus, supermarket, and carnival are generally crowded places, so they would not be suitable for getting away from it all.
The most commonly accepted way to improve your skills in playing guitar is through practice. This involves consistently playing and practicing your skills over time, which helps you develop muscle memory and improve your technique. While polishing your guitar and having fun may also be important factors in enjoying the experience of playing guitar, they are not necessarily the key to becoming good at it. Similarly, having a desire or passion for playing guitar may motivate you to practice more, but it alone will not make you a skilled player. The term "pick" may refer to a guitar pick, but it is not a complete answer to the question and does not provide enough information to demonstrate knowledge of guitar-playing.
The sentence suggests that the dog was able to get the sheep in line, which requires a certain level of organization to achieve. Basic organization skills, such as grouping similar items together or arranging things in a particular order, can be useful in controlling and directing the movements of others. Patience, intention, and decision-making skills may also be useful for a dog in this situation, but the sentence specifically mentions the dog's ability to organize the sheep. Buying movie tickets is unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Mary was singing as a way to improve her mood, as she was not happy. Singing is often used as a form of self-expression and can be a cathartic activity that helps to release emotions. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as Mary's singing is not related to physical ailments such as sore throats or hoarse voices, and being heard or sad are not specific motivations for her singing.
The question is asking for a positive action to take with used glass. Shattering, shatter, tempered, and broken all suggest destructive actions, so those options can be eliminated. Recycling, on the other hand, is a positive and environmentally-friendly action to take with used glass. Glass can be melted down and reused to create new products, reducing waste and conserving resources.
The sentence implies that the marathon involved physically demanding activity (dancing) for a prolonged period of time, which would logically result in exhaustion. The other options (humiliation, sweaty, blisters) do not necessarily follow from the information given and seem less likely to be a direct consequence of the activity described. Fatigue is also a possibility, but exhaustion is a stronger and more specific answer choice.
The sentence suggests that the person's belief in a philosophy is not slight, but extreme. The word "radical" means extreme, especially in terms of political or social beliefs. The other options do not convey the same level of extremeness or intensity. "Significant" and "important" are neutral words that do not imply any extreme beliefs or actions, while "essencial" is a misspelling of the word "essential."
The sentence suggests that Bob has access to electricity next to his nightstand, which is typically found in a bedroom. This eliminates the options of church, concert, opera, and restaurant, which are unlikely places to have a nightstand with an electrical outlet.
The sentence suggests that John initially thought that the distance between him and Sally was a problem, but that they later found out that they shared something. Based on this, it seems that the answer is likely to be a term that refers to emotional or psychological closeness between two people. "Closeness" therefore seems to be the most appropriate option, as it directly implies a sense of intimacy or emotional proximity. "Near," "proximity," and "close" are similar in meaning but do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection. "Duration" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about where employees, in general, would be likely to carry a weapon. The options "war," "police station," and "army bunker" are all specific locations where members of the military or law enforcement might carry weapons, but they do not apply to all employees. "Holster" is a device used to carry a weapon, rather than a place where an employee would carry one. "Security personnel" is the only option that makes sense as a general category for employees who might be expected to carry a weapon in the course of their work.
Tacos typically involve a meat filling, such as ground beef, that needs to be cooked before it can be added to the taco shell. The phrase "cook on the stove" is a clue that the answer involves a cooking method, and out of the given choices, only "brown meat" is a cooking method that involves cooking something on a stove. The other choices, like "Mexico" and "bake bread," do not make sense in the context of cooking tacos.
The sentence suggests that there are potato fields in this region, which narrows down the choices to regions known for potato farming. Alaska, Hells Canyon, and South Lake Tahoe are not typically associated with potato farming, while both Idaho and Canada are well-known for their potato production. However, the mention of "central" in the sentence indicates that the correct answer is Central Idaho, rather than Canada which is a larger country with potato fields in multiple regions.
A cord is often used to help secure or tighten different parts of a tent, such as the rainfly or the poles. It is unlikely to be found in a delivery room, hardware store, or sporting goods store unless it is specifically sold as a camping accessory. While a backpack may have cords or straps to fasten the bag, it is less likely to be the correct answer as it doesn't have a direct connection to tents. The most likely option is inside the tent, since this is where the cords are typically used.
The sentence suggests that workers are surrounding materials, which implies that there is some sort of construction or building work happening in the area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hazardous waste zone might have materials and workers, but the sentence does not mention anything about hazardous materials specifically. A fabric store, science lab, or house would not typically have workers surrounding materials in the same way a construction site would.
Lawns are typically associated with residential areas where homeowners have front or back yards. Suburbia is a term used to describe the residential areas that surround a city or town, which are typically characterized by single-family houses with front and backyards. Golf courses may have many lawns, but they are not common in everyday life and are usually reserved for recreational activities. The other options, such as a neighborhood or Michigan, do not have a clear association with lawns.
alas are native to Australia and are not commonly found in other parts of the world. Therefore, James must be living in Australia to have spotted the animal while driving to work. The other options, such as wilderness, great outdoors, and jungle, are more general terms and do not provide any specific information that would help in answering the question. Queensland is a region in Australia and could potentially be a correct answer, but the other options are not relevant.
The word "obsolete" means that something is no longer in use or has become outdated. Tube televisions are old technology that have largely been replaced by newer, more advanced displays like LCD and LED screens. Therefore, it would be accurate to describe a tube television as obsolete. The other options don't fit the context of the question- addictive, entertaining, bycone and legal all don't make sense in relation to a tube television.
The question is asking specifically for a gift shop where one would be able to buy a Mickey Mouse product. Disneyland is a well-known theme park that is heavily associated with Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, so it is a logical choice for the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to Mickey Mouse or gift shops in general.
The question is asking where you would be unable to read a newspaper, suggesting that there is a reason why reading a newspaper in this particular location is not possible. The other options (porch, school, jail, library) are all locations where reading a newspaper would be possible, but a rug is not a suitable surface for reading as it is too soft and uneven.
Texas is a state in the United States of America, located in the southern part of the country. It is bordered by Mexico to the south, but is not located within Mexico. Texaphyrin is a chemical compound and has no relation to the location of Texas. Southwest and Gulf States refer to regions within the United States, but do not answer the specific question of where Texas is located.
The sentence implies that the square is a location that John could go to despite his dislike for it, suggesting it is a place that is frequently visited. "Town center" is a common term used to describe the central commercial and social hub of a town, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not relate to a place that someone could go to on a regular basis.
The context of the question implies that the teacher wants to begin projects that involve collaboration among students. Therefore, the logical choice would be to group students together to work on the project. The other options do not directly relate to the idea of group work and may be less effective or not applicable in this scenario.
The sentence suggests that the reason why the person doesn't kill others is related to a personal moral or ethical stance. Values typically guide personal behavior, and valuing human life is a common moral stance that people hold. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Grandma always had baked cookies that were easily accessible by looking in a particular location. The most likely location for storing cookies in this context would be a jar, which is often used for storing baked goods. The other options do not make sense in the context provided.
The question asks for something that is likely to crash in an intersection, which is a place where multiple roads meet and cars are likely to cross paths. The other options, such as a fork in the road, town center, city street, and street corner, do not necessarily indicate a higher likelihood of crashes.
The sentence suggests that there is something that everything is made of, which is a broad concept that encompasses all the choices given. However, the use of the phrase "when one thinks enough about it" implies that the answer may not be immediately obvious or intuitive. The options "cupboard," "own home," "stuff in home," and "garbage dump" are all specific and limited in scope, making them unlikely correct answers. "Everything" is the most all-encompassing and abstract option, aligning with the idea that all things are made of something.
The question suggests that watching television too much can cause a certain type of pain. The word "pain" and the options provided suggest that the answer is related to physical discomfort rather than emotional or psychological effects. Of the options provided, only headaches are commonly associated with prolonged screen time, particularly with television viewing. Fatigue and addiction may be associated with prolonged television viewing, but they are not a direct result of the screen itself. Power gains and entertainment are not related to the negative effects of television viewing.
The sentence indicates that the speaker was waiting for a specific event to happen, but they knew it wouldn't happen right away. They then waited a quarter past a certain time before turning on the football game. The most likely option for this time is an hour, as it is a common unit of time measurement and fits with the quarter-past reference. The other options do not make sense in the context of waiting for a specific event to happen at a particular time.
The only option that makes sense is "volunteer," as it suggests that the person is working for free. The other options do not provide any logical explanation for why someone would continue to work without receiving payment. "Thank god," "wait in line," "offer help," and "enjoy working" are all unrelated to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions a physical need to move and suggests that if this need is not met, something will atrophy, which typically refers to a decline or wasting away of muscles. This implies that the correct answer would be something related to the body or physical activity, such as muscles. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a job and used their connections to secure an interview. The word "company" is a commonly used term for a business or organization where someone could potentially work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Wall" and "store" are too vague and could refer to many different types of businesses, while "computer network" and "airport" are too specific and do not fit the broader context of the sentence.
The phrase "in the old days" suggests that the question is referring to a time before the internet, which was not widely available until the late 20th century. The options "dewey decimal system" and "newspaper" are not places to find information, but a system of organization and a medium for news dissemination, respectively. The correct answer is likely a book or a library, which were the primary sources of information before the advent of digital media.
The sentence suggests that Joe and Jane have started engaging in unprofessional behavior that compromises their objectivity. The term "fucking" is often used figuratively to mean collaborating or collaborating intimately. Therefore, it could be the unprofessional behavior that Joe and Jane are engaging in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Dirty clothing is typically put in a washing machine to be cleaned. The other options are places where clean or folded clothing may be stored, but they are not typically used for dirty clothing. A closet is for hanging clothes, a trunk is for storage while traveling, a drawer is for organizing clothes, and a suitcase is for traveling.
The sentence indicates that artificial intelligence is bringing about changes in society. The word "revolution" often refers to a significant and far-reaching change, which makes it a suitable choice in this context. The other options do not appear to relate to the topic of artificial intelligence and societal change.
The sentence suggests that George has difficulty expressing his emotions, as he keeps things bottled up. The option "say love" refers to expressing a deep emotional feeling towards someone, which would be difficult for someone like George. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Sit-ups are a type of exercise that can help strengthen and tone the abdominal muscles. This can lead to a reduction in belly fat and a more toned appearance in the waist area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the effects of doing sit-ups.
Contact with poison ivy causes an allergic reaction in most people, resulting in an itchy and uncomfortable rash. The other options do not accurately describe the typical symptoms of poison ivy contact.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a combination of trees and heavy rain. The option "sahara" is a desert and doesn't have trees or heavy rain; "disneyland" is a theme park and not a natural area; "street" is not an area with trees, and the option "seattle" is known for its heavy rainfall but doesn't specify any trees. This leaves "forest" as the only option that fits both criteria. Forests are known for their abundance of trees, and certain types of forests, such as rainforests, experience heavy rainfall.
Death Valley is a large national park located in the western United States. It is well known and often visited by tourists from all over the world, making it highly unlikely that it would be located in a region as specific as West Virginia or Mountainous Area. Additionally, Death Valley is a significant enough location to be referred to by the continent it is located on, rather than just the country. Therefore, the correct answer is continent.
The phrase "ignorance is bliss" is a common idiom that suggests that sometimes it's better not to know the truth or to remain ignorant because it can lead to a sense of peace or happiness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of ignorance in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking to get a cheap room and that they are currently at a reception desk. Since reception desks are typically found at hotels, the answer is likely to be "at hotel." The other options (lobby, office park, cellphone, motel) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "fashionable" suggests that the satchel is likely to be found in a store that sells clothing and accessories instead of a place like an airport or luggage compartment. The other options are also unlikely to be the correct answer because they do not provide any context related to the purchase of a satchel.
The sentence suggests that the weasel was searching for something specific in the garbage, which is likely to be food. Backyards are a common place where people dispose of food scraps and other organic waste, which would make them a likely target for a scavenging weasel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "why would I be killed" implies that the reason for potential harm is not related to personal actions, such as attacking someone or being gay. The use of the preposition "of" also suggests that the harm is coming from a feeling or attitude, rather than an action. "Hatred" is a common motivator for violence and harm towards individuals who are perceived as different or who belong to a marginalized group. The other options may be reasons for violence or self-defense, but do not directly address the question of why someone would be targeted for harm.
The sentence mentions that the graphic designer worked with digital tiles, which suggests that they worked in a digital medium. The fact that these tiles were used to make maps further supports the idea that they were creating content for a computer game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "transgressed" implies that Bill broke a rule or boundary that was socially or morally significant. The fact that the context does not mention anything about politics or sports suggests that the correct answer is likely to be "society". The inclusion of "basketball" twice in the choices is likely a mistake or typo.
Teeth whitening bleachers are a cosmetic dental product, which would not be found at a gymnasium or sporting event. The correct answer would likely be a place that sells dental or oral care products, such as a pharmacy. The presence of "bleachers" in the question may be a typo or a misused term, as bleachers are typically associated with seating arrangements at sports events rather than dental products.
Louisiana is one state out of 50 in the United States, so the correct answer is "united states." The other options are either specific to Louisiana (deep south, gulf states), unrelated to geography (98 of the world's crayfish), or vague (swamp).
The sentence suggests that the child has finished playing with their toys and needs to do something next. The option "clean room" is the most logical choice as it is a common instruction given to children after they finish playing with their toys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "go to bed" is more suitable as a bedtime instruction, "become adult" and "grow up" are milestones that occur over time and not something that can be done immediately, and "read book" is not related to cleaning up after playing with toys.
The sentence is asking for the name of the feet on a dog. The word "paws" is commonly used to refer to the feet of dogs (and other animals with similar feet). The other options (two ears, one mouth, big heart, tail) do not refer to the feet of a dog, and therefore are not the correct answer.
Rest areas are public areas along highways or major roads where travelers can stop to take a break and use the facilities. They usually have restrooms that are accessible to anyone who needs to use them, regardless of whether they are a paying customer or not. The other options may have public restrooms, but they may not be available for use by just anyone or may have restrictions on who can use them.
The use of an arch as a doorway is a common architectural feature in buildings, where it adds both aesthetic value and structural strength. While arches may also be used in bridges and cathedrals, the sentence specifically refers to a doorway, suggesting that it is more likely to be found in a building. The option "ancient Rome" may be a distractor, as the use of arches was prominent in Roman architecture, but it does not directly relate to the context of the sentence. The option "hole" is clearly not appropriate for the sentence.
Threaded rods are commonly used in construction and can typically be found in hardware stores. The other options do not have any clear connection to threaded rods or their use in construction.
A vase is a type of vessel used for holding flowers or other decorative items. The base of a vase is the part that sits on a flat surface and provides stability for the vessel. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the shark is in a location that is specific to Northern California. Sea World and aquariums are general terms that do not refer to a specific location. Tropical waters and great oceans are too broad to pinpoint the shark's location to Northern California. Tamales Bay is a specific location in Northern California that is known for having a diverse range of marine life, which could explain why the shark is there.
The sentence suggests that the picture was framed for personal enjoyment, as the speaker wants to look at it while eating dinner. This implies that the picture is likely in their home or a personal space, making the most likely location for it to be on a table. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that rocks can be found on planets and moons, but there is a wide variety of them on a specific location. The only choice that relates to a location where rocks can be found on earth is the surface of the earth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Joe bought grapes as a topping for something, and the most likely option is a bowl of fruit. Grapes are a common fruit that can be used in fruit bowls, often as a colorful and juicy addition. The other options do not make as much sense in this context - Joe is unlikely to use grapes to make wine or shop with them, and they do not make a great topping for desserts or a source of sunshine.
The word "store" in the sentence suggests that the answer has to do with a location where items are kept. "Chess set and other such entertainment items" are typically stored in a cupboard or cabinet, which makes it an appropriate option. Coffeehouse or coffee house is a public place where coffee is served, and therefore is not a good choice for home entertainment storage. Laundry room is mostly used for washing clothes, so it doesn't fit either. Game room is also a possibility for storing board games, but the most commonly used term for storage is cupboard.
The sentence suggests that the token was not a genuine coin and was found among other coins in a collection. A coin collection is a grouping of rare or valuable coins, and it makes sense that a fraudulent token would be identified in such a context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or have any clear connection to coins or tokens.
The term "alley cat" specifically refers to a feral or stray cat that lives in urban areas, often in alleys or other places with limited human traffic. Therefore, the most likely answer is "alley." The other options may be comfortable for a cat, but they do not have the same association with the term "alley cat."
The sentence suggests that inflation is a concern in economics, but the focus is on the impact of inflation on someone who is about to become a homeowner. The phrase "had to worry about" implies that the impact of inflation is negative, which suggests that the correct answer is related to inflation having a potential impact that would be problematic for someone in the process of purchasing a home. The correct answer, "raising interest rates," is the most plausible choice, as inflation can lead to higher interest rates, which in turn would make it difficult for the homeowner to afford their mortgage payments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James desires to have tea but does not have any options available to him at home. He then rushes out, which indicates that he is seeking a location where tea is available. The options "internet cafe" and "refrigerator" do not make sense in this context, as they do not typically offer tea. "Teapot" and "cupboard" suggest that James may be able to make tea at home, but the sentence clearly states that he does not have any tea or teabags. "Coffee shop" is the most likely option, as coffee shops commonly offer a variety of tea options.
Bald eagles are commonly associated with the United States, and are particularly prevalent in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. However, Florida is also a known habitat for bald eagles. The question suggests that there is a location where foreigners might expect to see a bald eagle, but where they probably won't. This indicates that the answer is not one of the typical habitats for bald eagles, such as Canada, Washington, or Colorado. Utah is also not known as a particularly common habitat for bald eagles. Therefore, the correct answer must be Florida, which may surprise foreigners who are not aware of the state's bald eagle population.
The sentence suggests that the poet needed to write about his distant past, which is likely to be related to his personal life experiences. Therefore, the most appropriate place for the poet to go to write about his past is likely to be his own home, where he may have access to personal documents, photographs or other memorabilia that can help him remember his past experiences. The other options do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Nightclubs are often associated with music, dancing, and socializing. The phrase "on the floor" refers to the dance floor, where people typically come together to dance and enjoy the music. The other options do not make sense in the context of a nightclub, where the focus is on socializing and having fun.
A stylus is a small tool used to interact with touchscreens, and is typically associated with devices like smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) like the Palm Pilot. While it's possible that a stylus could be used in a school or garage setting, the other options (hand and record player) are unlikely choices for where one would keep a stylus.
A towel is often used in a gym for wiping sweat off during or after a workout, and it makes sense to keep them close by in the locker room where gym-goers change and store their belongings. In the showers or swimming pool, towels may also be provided, but they would likely be kept there rather than brought from home. A linen closet or cupboard may be used to store towels in other contexts, but it is less likely in a gym setting.
The sentence suggests that Bob is not going to bed despite it being a weekday, which implies that he is not able to sleep. The word "insomnia" refers to the condition of being unable to sleep, which is the most likely reason why Bob is staying up late. The other options either have no connection to the context of the sentence or do not fit the situation presented.
The sentence suggests that a ticket booth is located at the front of a specific type of establishment. Movie theaters commonly have ticket booths located at the front of the building, where patrons can purchase tickets before entering. The other options may also have ticket booths, but without additional context, it is unclear where they might be located.
The sentence implies that people typically bring a reusable bag with them to the grocery store and use it to carry their purchased items. The phrase "keep a bag" suggests that the bag is already in their possession, and the most likely place for them to keep it is in the shopping cart that they use to navigate the store. The other options, such as a drawer or shelf, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that the eraser will be used in class, so it should be brought to school. The choices "office supply store" and "schools" are not places to put the eraser, but rather places to acquire an eraser. "Under the arm" is not a practical place to put an eraser while traveling. The most logical answer is to put the eraser in a pencil box, which can be easily carried to class.
The sentence suggests that the flashing LED is visible on some sort of display or monitor, which is typically associated with a computer screen. The other options, such as electronic equipment or pc board, are too broad and do not specifically refer to a computer screen. It is also important to note that not all flashing LEDs indicate a serious problem, but the sentence implies that in this case it might be a cause for concern.
Sharks are typically found in saltwater environments, such as the ocean. Bull sharks are one of the few shark species that can tolerate freshwater and are sometimes found in rivers and lakes. However, the question specifically states that it is not a bull shark, so the answer must be one of the options related to saltwater environments. Sea world is a theme park and not a location where a shark could go to live, so it can be ruled out. "Medium" and "seawater" may not be specific enough to indicate that the shark needs to go to a saltwater environment, whereas "Atlantic Ocean" specifically refers to a saltwater environment. Therefore, "saltwater" is the best answer.
The question is asking about what can come before or lead to civil action, which is a legal process. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the law. Options such as hurt feelings or bad feelings are not directly related to the legal process and are unlikely to precede civil action. Going to court and trial are part of the legal process, but they are not necessarily the initial step that comes before initiating civil action. Therefore, law is the most appropriate answer as it refers to the legal framework under which civil action takes place.
The sentence indicates that the men had a positive conversation and found common ground, which suggests they had a friendly relationship. Describing their feeling toward one another as "like" would be a natural choice to convey this sense of mutual respect and agreement. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Problem" and "contract" have negative connotations and do not fit with the positive tone of the conversation. "Peace" and "love" are also unlikely choices as they suggest a deeper emotional connection that may not be present in this context.
The question is asking where to get a specific item, a table. A furniture store would be the most likely place to purchase a table as they specialize in selling furniture for homes and businesses. The other options, such as demonstration, kitchen, hallway, and apartment, do not offer a clear connection to purchasing furniture.
The question implies that the person being asked is a man and therefore, the answer choice that would apply specifically to men's clothing is "pant pocket". Men's pants often have pockets that are suitable for carrying small items such as eyeglasses cases. The other options such as purse or bag are more commonly associated with women's accessories. Store and drawer are also not appropriate because they do not suggest a specific location on a person's body for carrying an eyeglasses case.
The word "intense" suggests a high level of competition, which can be a source of stress for many people. Stress is a common response to intense competition because it can cause feelings of pressure, anxiety, and overwhelm. The other options, like argument and tension, may be outcomes of intense competition, but they are not directly related to how someone might feel in response to it. Anger and happiness are also unlikely because they are emotions that are typically associated with a personal victory or defeat, rather than a response to competition itself.
The sentence implies that the person meets their friend every Monday morning to engage in an activity that involves both coffee and conversation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Saying "hi" or shaking hands could be a part of the greeting, but they would not typically be the main activity. Having sex or taking a train do not make sense in this context.
The context of the sentence suggests that the noise is being made intentionally by a group of people. A big city, transmission, and classroom would likely have some level of supervision or regulations in place to prevent excessive noise. In the front yard, it would be unlikely for a group of people to gather and intentionally make noise without supervision. A bowling alley, however, is a social gathering place where people often come to make noise and have fun, with little to no supervision.
The question suggests that the answer should refer to a place where most people can get food, which rules out options like the fridge, oven, and kitchen as not everyone has access to these. The table is also not a good answer as it is not a place where one can get food, but rather a surface where food can be served. The most plausible answer is the supermarket, as it is a place where a variety of foods can be purchased and is accessible to most people.
The word "murder" implies that the predator intentionally caused the death of their victim, so the correct answer would be "kill." The other options may also be associated with causing harm or pain to someone, but they do not specifically relate to causing death.
The options suggest different places where a garden could be located. A park is a public space and unlikely to be available for personal gardening. A fence is a structure that one can attach plants to, but it is not a location for a garden. Ground is too general and does not give a specific location. A balcony is a small space and is not ideal for most types of gardening. A backyard is a typical location for a personal garden, as it is a readily available outdoor space owned by the individual.
The sentence suggests that the consumer should be cautious when presented with proof that seems too good to be true. Scrutinizing means examining something closely and carefully, which is a good approach to determine whether the proof is legitimate or not. Exasperation, change of heart, and boredom do not suggest any action the consumer can take to evaluate the proof. Reading is a general action and does not necessarily relate to the context of being presented with proof.
The sentence suggests that the man ate his lunch quickly and did not chew his food properly, which led to a negative consequence. Choking is a common risk of swallowing large pieces of food without proper mastication, so this is the most logical choice. Getting full, burping, eating food, and regurgitating do not fit with the context of the sentence or contribute to the logical progression of events.
The sentence suggests that Susan spent most of her day listening to the radio, but did not like talk shows. The most likely alternative for her preferred listening genre would be stations that play music. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "entertained" suggests that the person enjoyed watching the film, which could lead to a feeling of joy. Laughter and liking are also possible reactions to being entertained, but masturbation and erection are not appropriate or common reactions to watching a film.
The sign is specifically referring to picnickers, suggesting that they are in a public area where people go to have picnics, such as a park. Squirrels can be found in many environments, including forests, trees, roofs, and yards, but the mention of picnickers implies an area specifically designated for recreational activities. Therefore, the correct answer is park.
The question states that the astronaut needed to know the location of the English Channel, which is a body of water located between England and France. Therefore, the correct answer would be England, as that is the location of the specific geographic feature the astronaut was trying to locate. The other options are not relevant to the question or do not provide an accurate answer.
The sentence is asking about a negative association with baseball, and "stupid" is the only option that suggests a dislike or disdain for the activity. The other options all suggest positive feelings towards baseball, which would not make sense in the context of someone who does not enjoy it. "Fun," "entertainment," and "love" are all positive words that indicate enjoyment, whereas "stupid" is a negative word that suggests a lack of interest or distaste.
The sentence states that John and James loved making friends. This suggests that the act of making friends brought them positive emotions. The choice "good feeling" is synonymous with happiness and therefore the correct answer choice. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they suggest negative outcomes rather than positive ones.
The sentence indicates that John had a problem that made celebrating with his friends awkward. The word "awkward" suggests discomfort or unease in social situations, which may be caused by a difficulty with intimacy. This could include a fear of opening up emotionally, feeling uncomfortable with physical touch or closeness, or having a history of trauma or abuse. The other answer choices do not align with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person had been sitting in meetings for a long time and needed to move, implying that they were sitting still for an extended period. The other choices (be still, stay put, stay still, standing still) do not fit the context of the sentence as they imply a state of not moving or changing position, whereas the person clearly needed to move.
Foxes are wild animals that typically live in their natural habitat, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. They may occasionally wander into residential areas like backyards or hen houses in search of food, but these are not their everyday habitats. Storybooks and bathrooms are not places where foxes would typically go, making natural habitat the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the person needs ice to have a refreshing drink, but the appliance that they usually use to keep their drinks cold is not working properly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that it is asking about a place where people go to view multiple rosebushes. While small plantings of roses may be found in some of the other options (such as a backyard or hedgerow), the only option that specifically refers to a location with multiple varieties of plants is a botanical garden. Additionally, botanical gardens often have dedicated rose gardens or sections, making them a likely answer.
Glue is a common item used in office and school settings, and it is typically stored in a desk drawer or supply cabinet when not in use. The other options, such as art room or bathroom, may also be places where glue is used, but they are not as common for storage purposes. The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a common location for storage rather than a specific use case.
The sentence implies that the woman was concerned about the environmental impact of washing clothes, which suggests that she may have been trying to conserve resources like water. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to involve her actions related to water usage. The other answer choices do not address this concern directly and are less likely to be correct.
The word "false stories" suggests that the act of talking to others about them may lead to the spread of rumors. Rumors are often based on untrue or exaggerated information that is passed from person to person through conversation. Adverse reactions, such as disagreement or anger, can be a result of spreading false stories, but it is less likely to be the direct outcome. Teaching, friendship, and increased understanding are not directly related to the act of talking about false stories.
The word "achromatic" refers to colors that have no hue, such as white, black, and shades of gray. The yellow color of the sun, while appearing bright and bold, is actually achromatic because it has no hue of its own but rather comes from a combination of different wavelengths of light. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the spirit was leaving the physical body of a human being and transitioning to the afterlife. The options "bar," "cemetery," and "graveyard" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are locations rather than the thing that the spirit was leaving. "Earth" is too general and could refer to many things, but "human being" directly relates to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a helium tank being used for research, suggesting that the correct answer is related to scientific work. The options "sadistic dentist's office" and "moon" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. "Atmosphere" is a possibility, but it does not specifically relate to research. "Chemistry lab" and "laboratory" both indicate a scientific purpose, but "chemistry lab" may be too specific and limiting, whereas "laboratory" could encompass various fields of research that may use helium tanks. Therefore, the best choice is "laboratory."
The best way to locate the United States is by using a map. The other options do not provide a clear method for finding the country. North America is a continent that includes the United States but does not pinpoint its location. The northern hemisphere and western hemisphere are not specific enough to locate a country within them. Magnets have no relevance to geographic location.
Excavating for new roads in a city is likely to cause traffic jams as it involves closing off streets and rerouting traffic. The other options do not involve the same kind of urban infrastructure and would not have a significant impact on road traffic.
The sentence explicitly states that James is concerned that potatosol might not be legal for long, suggesting that there is a possibility of it being banned in the future. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Baseball is a sport that is typically played in stadiums, and is referred to as a "game" rather than a "sporting event," "watch show," "show," or "demonstration." While other events may take place in stadiums such as concerts or demonstrations, the context of the sentence specifically mentions being a spectator at a baseball stadium, indicating that the correct answer is "watching a game."
The mention of "shopping bag full of food" suggests that the person went to a place where they purchase groceries in bulk or large quantities. A garden typically would not produce enough food to fill multiple shopping bags, a closet is not a place to buy food, and a restaurant or mart would not usually result in large amounts of food being taken home in shopping bags.
The sentence suggests that achieving a goal requires hard work, despite the fact that you may not always get what you want. Working hard is one of the key elements of achieving a goal, as it requires time, effort, and patience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not offer a clear solution to achieving a goal.
The verb "awake" implies that the person is currently sleeping or unconscious. Therefore, the most reasonable action to follow being awake is to open their eyes, which is a natural response when one regains consciousness. The other options do not make sense in the context of being awake, as they either refer to a state of sleep or being unconscious.
The sentence suggests that the speaker experienced a romantic breakup, which can often result in emotional distress and a feeling of heartbreak. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence – annoyance may be a reaction to the breakup, but does not describe the speaker's emotional state, and hospitalized and schizophrenia are not related to the situation at all. Stress could be a result of the breakup, but the phrasing of the sentence implies that the speaker is specifically referring to the emotional pain of heartbreak.
The question is asking about the reason for going to bed, suggesting that there is a benefit or purpose to doing so. The most likely reason for going to bed is to get good sleep, as that is the primary function of going to bed at night. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is hoping to ride a rollercoaster, which is a ride typically found in amusement parks. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "amusement park." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "yourself" suggests that the question is asking about personal hygiene. The word "dirt" implies that something is dirty or soiled. The most appropriate action to take to clean oneself thoroughly would be to take a bath, as this would allow the person to wash their entire body. The other options either refer to cleaning clothes or using a cloth to wipe off a specific spot on the body, which may not be sufficient for removing all dirt.
The sentence implies that despite coming from different backgrounds, everyone mentioned in the sentence shares a common trait. The term "human" encompasses all individuals regardless of their background, making it the most appropriate choice. The other options may also apply to some individuals, but they do not encompass everyone and therefore are not as suitable as the answer.
Exercise is known to have many health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and improving overall health. The sentence specifically mentions "preventing" something, which suggests that exercising can help with a specific health issue. Heart attacks are a major health concern and are often caused by a lack of exercise and poor heart health. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "emotional" implies that the person is likely to show or express their feelings. Therefore, the choice that matches this description is "expressive". The other options do not necessarily relate to being emotional.
The sentence suggests that the wind was warm, which means it was not likely blowing hard or changing direction. Dry hair and cotton mouth are not typically associated with the effect of wind on a person's body. However, warm wind can have a drying effect on the skin, which is why dry skin is the most appropriate choice.
The sentence mentions that the crab was being netted off the coast of Louisiana, which is a state located on the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, it is likely that the crab was caught in the Gulf of Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Tidepools are typically located near rocky shores and would not be a common place to catch crabs, while the North Sea is located in Europe, making it an unlikely location for a crab caught off the coast of Louisiana. A grocery store is a place where people buy food, not where crabs are caught. A fishing boat is a possible location for catching crabs, but the sentence does not provide any direct evidence to support this option.
The sentence suggests that thinking about nice memories will lead to a particular outcome. The word "relax" is most commonly associated with recalling pleasant experiences and can often have a calming effect. None of the other options are clearly linked to the context of the sentence.
The word "facts" suggests that the sentence is referring to knowledge that is based on objective evidence and can be verified. The phrase "know truth" is a common expression used to describe the pursuit of accurate, verifiable knowledge. The other options, such as "intelligent children" or "wonderful memories", do not directly relate to the concept of factual knowledge. Similarly, "acknowledgment" and "confidence" may be desirable outcomes of knowing the truth, but they are not the same as knowing the truth itself.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person needs an electric motor to power some sort of transportation. While an electric mixer, electric hammer, electric typewriter, and drum sander all use electric motors, they are not typically used for transportation. An electrabus, on the other hand, is a type of bus that is powered by an electric motor. Therefore, this would be the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that the ticket offices being referred to are all of the same type, which implies that they are part of a larger organization, such as a chain of movie theaters. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of ticket offices being uniform or part of a larger group.
The sentence implies that after getting paid, there is something specific that people should do. Among the options provided, paying bills is the most practical and responsible option. The other options, such as shopping and spending money, may bring temporary happiness or satisfaction, but they do not address the immediate financial responsibilities that come with getting paid.
The word "motel" typically refers to a type of lodging that is usually limited to one or two floors, as opposed to a hotel which may have multiple floors. The other options, such as Mexico or magic, do not suggest anything about the number of floors in a place to stay, and a phone book would only provide a list of options, not information about the type of lodging.
The sentence suggests that the farmer was good at raising chickens, but he wasn't ready to move up to something else. The options "rooster" and "hen" are both types of chickens, so they do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bought at store" is also unrelated, as it doesn't refer to any specific animal. "Tuna" is a type of fish, which is also unrelated. "Cow" is a larger animal and would represent a step up in terms of the complexity of the farming operation, making it the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person is describing a dish made with chicken and grape vinaigrette dressing. This type of dish is commonly referred to as a salad, which typically includes lettuce or other greens as a base. The other options, such as a bowl of fruit or a table, do not make sense in the context of describing a dish. Food store and restaurant are possible options, but the sentence doesn't give enough information to suggest whether the dish was bought from a store or eaten at a restaurant.
A green bill refers to a paper currency note, typically in the United States, where the most common denomination of paper currency is a green $20 bill. These bills are most commonly found and exchanged at banks, making "bank" the correct answer. The other options do not typically involve the exchange or use of paper currency.
Saying hello is a common way to greet someone. It is a polite and friendly way to acknowledge someone's presence and start a conversation. The other options may also be associated with greeting someone, but saying hello is the most direct and commonly used phrase.
The sentence suggests that there is a place where people intentionally avoid animals. Laboratory is a common place where animals are kept for scientific experiments, and people try to avoid disrupting their study or harming the animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as most people do not avoid animals in places like state parks, fairgrounds, zoos, or grocery stores.
The word "reception desk" implies a place where guests or visitors are greeted and checked in. In most cases, this would be located in a public area such as a lobby, where it is easily accessible and visible to those who are arriving. The other options may have desks, but they are less likely to have a dedicated reception desk, and would not be appropriate in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a physical sensation related to their bladder, which typically indicates a need to urinate. Restrooms are the most common place to relieve oneself in this situation, while the other options do not provide obvious relief or may be inappropriate. Going outside or into a cornfield may not be socially acceptable or sanitary, and school or Star Trek do not offer any logical solutions to a physical bodily sensation.
The sentence suggests that the Mississippi River is the largest in a certain region, which is further specified as North America. This means that the other options, such as wilderness or city, are not likely to be accurate choices since they do not describe a larger region. The word "continent" makes sense as a choice because it refers to a large landmass, and it also matches with the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person playing poker is not good at it, and the question is about what will happen if they continue to play. Losing money is a common result of playing poker, especially if one is not skilled at it. Discord, social events, competition, and heightened awareness are not necessarily related to playing poker or the consequences of not being good at it.
Illegal drugs are not approved by regulatory agencies for safe use, and therefore, they pose a high risk for negative health effects. The long-term use of illegal drugs could result in addiction, mental disorders, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular diseases, liver failure, and other serious health problems. The other options do not accurately reflect the negative consequences of taking illegal drugs.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is not well enough to go to school and needs to stay in bed to recover. Mom tells Sarah to stay in bed until she is able to go to school again, implying that she needs more rest. The option "get back under the covers" is similar but not exactly what mom said to Sarah, and the options "you're sick" and "were sick" are not relevant as they do not provide any information on what mom said to Sarah when she tried to get up.
The sentence suggests that the wild rosebush being referred to is a special or unique one, indicating that it may not be commonly found in most locations. The options "botanic garden," "flower garden," and "landscaping" all suggest more controlled and planned environments, making it less likely for a wild rosebush to be found there. "Courtyard" could potentially be a location where a rare wild rosebush is found, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Therefore, "California" is the most likely answer since it is a large state with diverse geography and flora, and could potentially be home to a special wild rosebush.
The word "runway" has multiple meanings, but in the context of this question, it is likely referring to the long platform used in fashion shows for models to walk on. In this case, the question is using a play on words, suggesting that the runway (platform) is trying to escape from the fashion show. The other options (city, military base, bowling alley, maze) do not have any clear connection to the context or meaning of the word "runway" in this question.
The sentence suggests that mines are typically located under something, which could be a geographical feature like a valley or mountain. Of the options provided, only "mountain" fits this description. Pennsylvania and Cambodia are both regions that have mines, but the sentence does not suggest a specific location. The words "desert" and "valley" do not provide any information about where mines are typically found.
The question is asking for an object that has a knob but does not have a display. A knob is typically used to adjust or control something, while a display is used to show information or visual output. Therefore, an object that has a knob but no display is likely to be a piece of hardware or equipment that is used for some sort of physical control or adjustment, such as a doorknob or a faucet handle. The other options either have displays or do not typically have knobs.
The term "several businesses in the same location" suggests a commercial area or a business district. A park is typically a recreational area, while an art museum or gallery would feature artistic works rather than businesses. A skyscraper or an office building could contain multiple businesses, but they could also be standalone facilities. A big city, on the other hand, is known for having numerous businesses within a relatively small geographic area, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the writer was struggling with his story and trying to reconnect with its purpose. The phrase "soon he began to finally" implies that a positive change occurred. "Get ideas" is the most logical choice because it suggests that the writer was able to overcome his writer's block and generate new ideas. "Daydream" and "become distracted" are possibilities, but they do not necessarily suggest that the writer was able to solve his problem. "Headache" and "gave up" are clearly not the correct answer, as they are negative outcomes.
The sentence suggests that the trombone is a lively and energetic instrument, which is a common characteristic of instruments played in marching bands. Marching bands perform outdoors and often move around, so they need instruments that can be heard over the noise of a crowd and the movement of the performers. The other options may not necessarily require an animated instrument like the trombone.
The sentence suggests that John used music as a tool to help him focus, which implies that the music had a calming or soothing effect. The choice "quiet mind" is the most logical answer, as it directly relates to the purpose of using music for concentration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Snakes are known to hide in areas with plenty of cover, and tall grass is a common place for them to seek shelter in meadows. The other options - underwater, tropical forest, amazon river, and western Texas - do not provide any context or indication for where a snake in a meadow would likely hide.
The sentence indicates that the person is feeling a burden or weight on their mind while driving to work, which suggests a feeling of stress. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to making important decisions or feeling a sense of burden. Agitation and impatience suggest a more reactive emotional state rather than a feeling of pressure or responsibility. Promotion is a positive occurrence that would not typically cause stress in this context.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person's primary intention for going fishing was to relax and be in nature. Therefore, it would not make sense for them to be solely focused on catching fish, as that would make the activity more stressful and less enjoyable. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "old" suggests that the clavichord is an antique item. Antique musical instruments are often found in museums, where they are preserved and displayed for the public to see. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
In order to take off, an airplane needs to accelerate down the runway. This is a critical step in the takeoff process, as the speed of the airplane directly impacts its ability to lift off the ground. The other options are not accurate or appropriate, as they either describe negative outcomes or unrelated actions.
The sentence suggests that the reason they decided to buy food from the stand, despite acknowledging that it was unhealthy, is because they were suffering from something that made them desperate for food. The option that best fits this context is hunger. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is specifically referring to something that can form above treeline, which is the elevation point beyond which trees cannot grow. Mountains are typically found at high elevations and can form above treeline due to various geological processes such as folding and faulting. The other options (surface of earth, pit, bridge, minerals) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "maze" suggests that the farmer is creating a corn maze, which is a popular activity in many regions. Corn is a common crop used for mazes because it grows tall and dense, making it easy to create pathways through the stalks. The other choices do not relate to the activity of creating a maze.
The question implies that crossing a busy road is a dangerous action, so choosing an answer that suggests the chicken survived the crossing would be inaccurate. "Stupid" is a negative adjective that implies the chicken was foolish or didn't understand the danger of crossing the road. "Eaten" and "smashed" both suggest the chicken met an unfortunate end. "Egg" and "beef" are not appropriate choices as they are not related to the context of the question. "Being brave" is the most appropriate choice as it suggests that the chicken took a risk by crossing the road and demonstrated courage or fearlessness in doing so.
It is common for players in hockey games to experience physical contact and collisions, which can result in injuries such as lost teeth. This is not typically seen in football or soccer, which are known more for their physicality and endurance rather than direct body-to-body contact. The other options, such as race tracks and generic "sporting events," do not have any clear connection to teeth loss.
The question is asking for a positive social interaction with others, and making friends is a common and healthy way to do so. Shaving legs, believing in God, and using drugs are personal choices that do not necessarily involve interacting with others. Standing upright is a physical posture and not related to social behavior.
The sentence implies that the people in the protagonist's neighborhood were likely facing difficulties that caused them to quit or drop out of something. The fact that the protagonist still possessed ambition in spite of the challenges suggests that he is determined to achieve something that is positive and impactful. Among the given choices, "go to school" seems to be the best fit as it is commonly associated with ambition and personal betterment. The other options do not seem to align with the sense of ambition conveyed in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that dust accumulates in the corner, which is a common location where dust can gather due to lack of airflow or cleaning. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as dust does not typically collect on a windowsill or with frogs, and while it can accumulate on a carpet or ground, the sentence specifically mentions the corner as the target location for the dust.
A fan is typically used in a setting that is hot or lacks air circulation, such as a hot room. It can help to circulate the air and create a cooling effect. A sports stadium is usually open-air, so a fan may not be necessary. An appliance store and hockey game do not require the use of a fan, and a sauna usually has its own ventilation system.
tchup is a condiment that is commonly found in grocery stores. While it may be stored in a refrigerator, the question is asking where to buy it, not where to find it once it has already been purchased. Ketchup is also commonly available in fast food restaurants, but the question is not pointing to where to find ketchup while eating out. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
The question suggests that the mailbox is located within a residential building, which eliminates the options of street corner and post office. The use of the word "residents" implies that the mailbox is only used by those who live in the building, ruling out door bell and front door as options. Therefore, the only logical choice is apartment complex.
The sentence mentions a dynamite expert checking fuses, which implies that explosives are being used. Explosives are commonly used in mining and construction, but specifically mentioning a dynamite expert suggests that the context is related to mining. The phrase "profitable day" also implies that the operation is a business, which further supports the idea that the context is related to mining. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of explosives or a profitability aspect.
The verb "attacking" implies an act of aggression towards the individual, which means that the correct response to the situation would be to defend oneself. The other options, such as "attacked" and "of hatred" are not actions but descriptions. "Call home" and "get rid of" are not appropriate responses in this context.
Milk is usually described as being white, as it is the natural color of milk produced by mammals, including cows, goats, and sheep. The other options do not relate to the color of milk.
Sheep typically graze in grassy areas such as meadows, fields or pastures. Fairgrounds and goat are not generally associated with grazing sheep, and it is not possible for sheep to graze on Mars. While some sheep may be found on farms, the term "farm" is too broad and does not specifically indicate where sheep graze.
The name of the expressway suggests that it is located in a specific area, which is likely to be Michigan since Ann Arbor is a city in Michigan. The other options such as "american city," "large city," "eastern united states," and "metropolitan area" are too broad for this specific question and do not provide any specific information about where the Ann Arbor Expressway can be found.
Teachers are known for encouraging children to ask many questions in order to stimulate curiosity and facilitate learning. Asking questions helps children to develop critical thinking skills and fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. None of the other options are relevant to what teachers typically encourage children to do.
The sentence mentions that the jelly needs to be preserved, which implies that it needs to be stored in a way that will allow it to last for a longer period of time. A jar is a common container used for preserving jelly, as it can be sealed tightly and kept in a cool, dark place to prevent spoilage. Refrigerating the jelly is another option, as the cold temperature can slow down the growth of bacteria and keep the jelly fresh for a longer period of time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that it is asking about the physical features of a human's upper body. Among the options, "two arms" is the only correct answer as it accurately describes a key feature of the upper body. The other options, such as "processing power" and "stupidity," are not physical features of the body and are not relevant to the context of the question.
The use of the word "humidity" suggests that the ficus requires a humid environment to grow vigorously. The tropical rainforest is known for its high levels of humidity, making it the most suitable choice. The other options, such as trees or a sunny window, do not necessarily provide the necessary humidity for the ficus to thrive. Additionally, the use of the word "weather" suggests that the ficus requires a consistent environment, which a rainforest can provide.
The sentence asks what is required to be good at driving cars, which suggests a need for a skill or ability. One of the options, concentrate, is a necessary skill for driving as it requires focus and attention to detail in order to safely operate a vehicle. The other options, such as having fun, listening to the radio, or speeding, are not necessarily related to being good at driving and may actually hinder one's abilities. While parking is a necessary component of driving, it is not the only requirement for being good at driving.
Livestock competitions are commonly held at fairgrounds, where there is ample space to accommodate livestock and their handlers. Ticket booths are often located at the entrance to such events to collect entry fees, so it is reasonable to assume that the ticket booth in this scenario would also be located at the fairgrounds. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the roadway did not lead towards an urban or populated area, as it is stated to lead away from town. The word "countryside" refers to rural, natural or agricultural areas, and is a natural fit for the direction described in the sentence. The other options may be possible destinations, but there is no clear evidence in the sentence to support them.
A book store is a place where one can buy a variety of books, including poetry books or collections of poems. The other options may also include poetry but are less likely to offer a wide selection or specialize in poetry specifically. A book of poetry and poetry book are essentially the same thing, while literature books may often contain poems but not exclusively, and bookshelves could refer to any collection of books at home or in a library.
The sentence mentions Concord, which is the capital city of New Hampshire. Additionally, the fact that an apple tree was planted suggests that the state is known for apple cultivation, which is a well-known industry in New Hampshire. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a risk associated with letting children participate in wrestling, which requires parents to sign a waiver. The sport involves constant physical contact between the wrestlers, which can potentially result in injury. The other options, such as sweat or Michigan, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Property damage or strong are not related to the concept of wrestling.
The sentence suggests that the person in question was running late for a class, which implies that they are a student. The sentence mentions that the person forgot their book, which further supports the idea that they are in a classroom setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the child was very active and energetic, and the speaker promises that eventually, the child will become tired and need to sleep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the baby was thirsty, and the mother took some action to address that need. The most likely and obvious action for a mother to take in this situation is to let the baby nurse, which satisfies the baby's thirst and hunger at the same time. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to the baby's needs or the mother's actions.
The sentence suggests that the lady needs to temporarily store a writing instrument while away from home, which is a situation that is commonly addressed by carrying a purse. Purses are often used to carry personal items while out and about, including writing instruments. The other options do not provide a practical or common solution for this situation.
The question asks about the type of structure that contains an eatery, implying that the eatery is a type of restaurant. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant, as it directly implies an enclosed structure designed to house a food-serving establishment. The other options, such as eating fast foods and veterinarian, do not imply a physical location or structure in the same way that restaurant or commercial building do.
Opera glasses are typically used to enhance the viewing experience when attending an opera or other live performance in a theater. They are not typically used in theme parks or museums, and while they may be sold in antique stores, this is not the primary use for this item. While some women may carry opera glasses in their purses, this is not the intended use of the item.
The question implies that the location being searched for is related to travel, and specifically for a place to stop before embarking on a long journey. Among the given choices, the airport is the most logical since it is a transportation hub where travelers often have to wait for extended periods before their flights depart. The other options, such as Las Vegas, Public House, Restaurant, and Michigan, are unrelated to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that Sarah was in a high-rise building when the fire started, which suggests that the difficult thing for her to escape would be the building itself. The other options (carpet, hallway, obesity, exchange) do not make sense in the context of a fire in a tall building.
The sentence suggests that the person was required to turn off the electric fan in a specific location, likely due to it being too loud and bothering others in that area. The options "closet", "hallway", "hot room", and "home" do not make sense in this context. "Office" is the most logical choice as it is a place where people work and where the electric fan is likely being used.
Razors are commonly used for shaving, which is a daily personal hygiene routine. Therefore, it is likely that a person would take a razor with them on vacation, and the most common place to transport personal hygiene items on vacation would be inside a suitcase along with other toiletries. The other options are less likely places to find a razor while on vacation, with the exception of a medicine cabinet, which may be present in a hotel room or vacation rental. However, the suitcase is still the most likely option.
The word "flat" usually refers to an apartment or a unit within an apartment building. Option A (city) and option D (town) are too broad, as flats can be found in both cities and towns. Option B (shoes) is completely unrelated to the question. Option E (London) is also too specific, as flats can be found in many places around the world, and the question does not provide any context to suggest that the location being discussed is London. Therefore, the correct answer is option C (apartment building).
The sentence suggests that the person (Sarah) was told by her doctor that she couldn't procreate, which indicates that she didn't think she could become pregnant. Therefore, the surprise she experienced must have been related to discovering that she was carrying one or more babies, which is the correct answer - twins. The other options (animals, population increase, venereal disease) are not related to the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence provides a clue that the steakhouse was located near the largest cattle ranch in America, which suggests that it was likely located in a state with a large cattle industry. From the choices given, Utah is the most likely option as it is known for being a major producer of beef and cattle. The other options do not have a significant connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the father is trying to teach his daughter a typically masculine activity, throwing a football. The daughter's reluctance to learn and her presumption that her father wants her to be a boy reinforces this idea. None of the other options relate to the gender aspect of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the brother is attending a school in a southern state known for high humidity levels. The mention of a Bulldog school could also be a hint towards the University of Georgia, which has a famous sports program called the Georgia Bulldogs. The other options either don't have any mention of geography or don't fit the context of a school located in the south.
Large speakers playing music are typically associated with live performances, such as concerts, where the audience is gathered to hear music played by a performer or group of performers. The other options, such as headphones or a desktop computer, do not typically involve large speakers playing music for an audience. The option of a car could be a possibility, but it is less specific than a concert and does not match the context of the sentence as well as the option of a concert.
A bean bag chair is a type of furniture that is designed to sit directly on the floor, without the need for any additional support or structure. It is typically filled with small polystyrene beads or other similar materials that conform to the shape of the user's body, providing a comfortable and supportive seating experience. The other options, such as den, rooms, house, and family room, do not specifically describe a surface that a bean bag chair would sit on.
The sentence suggests that the machine was used for academic or scientific purposes, which is commonly associated with laboratories. Laboratories are known for conducting experiments and research, and often rely on various machines and equipment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the teacher believed that everything mentioned in class was important, but it turned out that the information was only somewhat important for the upcoming quiz. The word "trivial" indicates that the information was not completely useless or insignificant, but rather unimportant in the grand scheme of things. The other options all suggest that the information was completely useless or unimportant.
The sentence implies that James collected literature, but does not provide information about where he specifically went to obtain it. All of the options listed are plausible choices for someone looking to collect literature. A public library would provide access to a wide variety of books and magazines, while his own home could contain books he has purchased or received as gifts. Shelves could refer to any type of bookshelf, whether in a library or home. Yard sales could be a good option for finding vintage or rare books at a lower cost. Books and magazines could refer to any store that sells those items.
A roadblock is a common method used by police to stop cars for various reasons, such as conducting a search, checking for proper documentation, or enforcing traffic laws. The other options such as the park, police station, front door, and street are not typical places for a police officer to stop a car.
In general, a party is a social gathering where people often engage in lively and energetic conversation with others. This can lead to the volume of the conversation increasing and becoming loud in order to be heard over music or other background noise. The other options do not inherently suggest that conversation would be more likely to get loud.
The sentence implies that the action of slapping a horse's butt results in it galloping, but the context suggests that this only applies when the person is on the horse. If someone were to slap a horse's butt while they were off of it, it is unlikely that the horse would respond by running quickly or galloping. Instead, it might be startled or frightened and try to move away from the person. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James thought his home was too hot, which can be associated with a hot and dry environment. Arizona is known for its hot and arid climate, making it the most likely option. Farm yards and Michigan do not provide any information about the climate, and the option of a western movie is too general to be a likely answer. South is too broad and could refer to many different locations with varying climates.
The question suggests that someone is going to court for someone they love, implying that the person is taking a morally upright action. Among the given choices, "tell the truth" is the only option that aligns with this moral responsibility. Obstructing justice would be the opposite of the right thing to do in court, while "forgive" and "get" do not make logical sense in this context. "Reproduce" is not related to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the faucet is located in a place where people come in, and the rainbow created by the water is considered annoying and gross, which suggests that the location is a restroom. The other options do not make sense in the context of a faucet spraying water in a confined indoor space.
The sentence suggests that the mail service does something with packages besides just dropping them off. The phrase "pick up" is commonly used in reference to mail services, indicating that they will collect packages from a location and transport them elsewhere. The other options do not make sense in this context; "open them" would not be a common practice for a mail service and "lift up," "picking up," and "catch" are not commonly used phrases in this context.
The sentence suggests that John is looking for a specific environment where he can find marmosets. Marmosets are native to South and Central America, which makes this the most likely answer. Grassy field, texas, wilderness, and american tropics do not have any clear connection to marmosets or their habitat.
Schools are institutions where students learn various subjects, including geography, math, and history. While it is possible to learn these subjects outside of school through other means such as books or online resources, the context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking where a computer user can learn these subjects. Therefore, the best option would be school, as it is a common place for computer users to access educational resources and online learning materials. The other options do not have any clear connection to education or learning.
New York is widely known as the birthplace of disco, as the music genre originated in the city's underground club scene in the 1970s. Rio de Janeiro is more commonly associated with samba and other traditional Brazilian music styles, while Germany and Town could refer to numerous different locations without any specific musical connections. Hotel does not make sense as an answer choice, as it is not a town or city.
The sentence suggests that a tense person is trying to achieve a certain state or feeling by listening to soft music. Soft music is often associated with relaxation and creating a peaceful atmosphere, which could help alleviate tension and stress. Therefore, the correct answer is relaxation. The other options, such as hunger or deafness, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The other options are all places where a person might play a trumpet, but they are unlikely to sell trumpets to customers. A music shop is the most logical option because it is a place where musical instruments are sold, and a person looking for a new trumpet would likely find what they need there.
Deodorant is typically used to reduce or eliminate unwanted body odors, particularly in the underarm area. The armpits contain sweat glands and hair follicles that can produce odor when bacteria on the skin break down sweat. Applying deodorant directly to the armpits can help prevent or diminish this odor. The other options do not relate to the context of using deodorant.
A clerk is a person who works at a front desk or reception area of a business, and is typically responsible for checking people in and out. In the context of a beauty salon, a clerk would likely be the one to greet customers, schedule appointments, and check them in for their services. The other options are not relevant to the context of a beauty salon, with a bellhop typically working at a hotel, a strip mall being a type of shopping center, and "beautifying hair" and "neighborhood" not being job titles or roles.
The word "occupation" suggests that the item in question is related to work or a job. The other options (nightstand, kitchen cabinet) do not typically have drawers that are useful for work-related purposes. File cabinets and filing cabinets are specifically designed for storing files, so they may have more than one drawer and are less likely to be associated with a single drawer. Therefore, the most likely item with a single drawer that is used during work would be an office desk.
The question implies that the presence of uneven land would make it difficult for an apple tree to grow in a certain location. Orchards, by definition, are areas where fruit trees are grown, so it is unlikely that an apple tree would not be grown in an orchard. On the other hand, the other options are states or locations that do not provide any information regarding the terrain or climate. Therefore, the correct answer is orchard.
The sentence suggests that the person is waiting in a place where machines and instruments are being used, which is likely a medical or dental office. The option "dentist" is most closely associated with this context, as it is common to hear the whir of dental instruments in a dentist's office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Spring is a time of growth and rejuvenation for many plants, making them happiest in a space where they have room to grow and receive adequate sunlight. A garden is a natural environment that provides both of these needs, and is therefore the best choice among the options presented. The surface of the earth could refer to any outdoor space, but does not suggest the additional factors of sunlight and growth that are important for plants in the spring. In the shade and in a greenhouse, plants may not receive enough sunlight to reach their full potential. A park is not necessarily designed for plants to thrive, but rather as a space for recreation and relaxation.
The options "suitcase", "begging", "head", and "lawnmower" are unlikely places to keep an unused hat. A "suitcase" is typically used for traveling and would not be a logical choice for keeping a hat that is not in use. "Begging" has no connection to the context of the sentence. "Head" would be a logical place to keep a hat that is in use, but not for an unused one. Similarly, a "lawnmower" is not a place to keep any type of clothing. Therefore, "closet" is the most logical answer as it is a common storage place for items of clothing.
The question implies that lawyers are known to react in a certain way when they are not treated well at a restaurant. Keeping quiet is a reasonable option as lawyers are often trained to maintain their composure in stressful situations. The other options are not likely to be typical reactions for lawyers in this situation.
The sentence suggests that the cat was inside a house since it pawed at a couch and walked in front of a TV. The options "back yard," "residential area," and "bathroom" do not fit this context. The option "comfortable position" may be a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to accurately answer the question. "Family room" is the most appropriate answer because it is a common area in a house where a couch and TV would be found, and where a cat would likely be inside the house.
When a real estate agent is showing a property that has some sort of issue or problem, they may try to cover it up or hide it from potential buyers. This can include things like painting over water stains, using strategic lighting to hide imperfections, or simply not mentioning certain issues unless specifically asked. The other options all have negative connotations and don't align with what a real estate agent would typically do in this situation.
The sentence suggests that the tires are part of vehicles that are designed for traveling long distances, which eliminates options like airport and car show. The use of the term "repair shop" implies that the vehicles in question may experience wear and tear on their tires, and may need to have them replaced or serviced periodically. "Black" and "under the bed" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Catching a cold is a common reason why someone may not be able to attend school temporarily. A cold can cause symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat, and coughing, which can make it difficult to concentrate in class and participate in activities. The other options do not relate to physical illnesses or circumstances that could prevent someone from attending school temporarily.
The sentence suggests that the person is at a field hospital, which is usually associated with military bases or locations where there is active military conflict. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Detroit and other cities and towns may have hospitals, but they are not typically referred to as "field hospitals." "Urban area" is also too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location of a field hospital.
The question is asking about the purpose of exercise, which is typically to improve physical fitness and strength. The option "tiredness" may occur as a result of exercise but is not the purpose of it. "Use energy" and "exhaustion" may also occur during exercise, but they do not describe the purpose of it. "Depletion" is not commonly associated with exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is "become stronger."
The context of the sentence suggests that people take a certain action when seeing a pretty sky. The most logical action would be to look up at it, as that is the most natural reaction to seeing something in the sky. Outdoors and atmosphere are too broad or general to be the correct answer, place on earth is not relevant to the question, and photo is also an unlikely answer as it suggests that a person takes a photo of the sky rather than simply looking at it.
The question is asking where bacteria is easy to wash off, which implies that some locations or surfaces may make it more difficult to remove bacteria. The ground is a relatively easy surface to wash bacteria off of, as it is typically not porous and can be hosed down or cleaned with soap and water. The other options are less likely to be associated with easy bacterial removal, as septic tanks are closed environmental systems, fingers and hands have crevices and folds that can trap bacteria, and the mouth has a natural microbiome that can make bacterial removal difficult.
The sentence suggests that doing housework for a long time can have a negative effect on a person. One common consequence of extended physical activity is fatigue or feeling tired, which is likely the correct answer. Low pay, nice home, boredom, and dizziness are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense as a consequence of doing housework.
City halls are usually located in the central business district or downtown area of a city. This is because the city hall is the administrative center of a city where government officials work and make decisions that affect the entire city. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the person was found guilty of neglecting their child, and as a result, the judge took away the child. The phrase "taking away the child" implies that the judge's decision was related to the welfare and care of the child. The option "taking care" is therefore the most appropriate as it is linked to the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

The context of the sentence suggests that the man passed out due to the consumption of alcohol, which can lead to alcohol toxicity. Alcohol toxicity occurs when there is an excessive amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, which can lead to impaired cognitive functions and even unconsciousness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement or come to a resolution, suggesting that they were in a dispute. The other options do not accurately describe the situation presented in the sentence. "Question" implies that the parties were merely unsure of something, "contradict" suggests that they were actively opposing each other's positions, "deny" implies that one party refused to accept the other's proposal, and "asking" does not make sense in this context.
The question asks for a method that will give a smaller result, which suggests that we need to reduce the size of the number. Adding or multiplying positive integers will always result in a larger number, so we can eliminate those options. Written down and start number game do not make any sense in the context of the question. Dividing a positive integer by another positive integer will always result in a smaller number, which makes it the correct answer.
Breaking someone's nose is likely to cause bleeding as this part of the body has many blood vessels close to the surface. Erections, wins, bruises, aches and pains do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not likely to be a result of breaking someone's nose.
The sentence suggests that Bill did not have extreme feelings of either admiration or disdain for the holy man. The word "revere" means to show deep respect or worship whereas "disdain" means to look down upon or despise. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bill had a moderate level of respect for the holy man, which is the best option among the choices. "Honour" and "admire" both suggest a higher level of admiration than what is described in the sentence, while "thankfulness" is not relevant to the context.
The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is creating a space where people can spend time reading and browsing books. This is a common feature of bookstores, where cozy chairs are often placed in quiet corners and nooks to encourage customers to stay and read. The other options do not have any clear connection to creating a space for reading and browsing.
The question suggests that the context is related to a place where students might get bored enough to look at the ceiling. While it is possible that this could happen in other locations, such as a house or loft, it is more likely to happen in a classroom where students are expected to sit still and listen to a lecture or read quietly for an extended period of time. Temples and most architectural structures may not necessarily be places where students spend a lot of time getting bored.
The question is asking where prepared mushrooms are purchased, suggesting that they have been processed or packaged in some way. The option "refrigerator" does not specify where the refrigerator is located or what it contains, making it an unlikely choice. "Ground" is nonsensical in this context. "Pizza" refers to a dish that can contain mushrooms, but it does not answer the question of where prepared mushrooms are purchased. "Forest" refers to where mushrooms may grow naturally, but it is not a place where they are typically purchased in a prepared form. "Grocery store" is the most logical choice as it is a common retail location where packaged and processed foods, including prepared mushrooms, can be found.
Bears are often attracted to human-generated waste, and dumpsters are a common source of food for them. State parks may have designated areas for waste disposal, but it is unlikely that a bear would know to seek those out. A dustbin is a British term for a trash can, so it may not be familiar to all readers. A recycling bin typically only contains materials that are not appealing to bears, such as paper and plastic. "Container" is a vague term that could refer to many different types of receptacles, so it is not a likely answer.
The sentence suggests that John turned on a light and saw a severed gazelle head, which is commonly associated with trophy rooms where hunters display their animal trophies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person has a great love of music, but it does not specify that they play an instrument or sing. The most likely activity they engage in while in the car is listening to music, and the option "listen to radio" is the most general and encompassing answer. The other options are specific and may not apply to everyone who has a love for music.
The sentence suggests that the formerly lonely man chatted with friends for a long time. It is likely that he would feel happiness after spending time with friends and enjoying their company. Tiredness may be a possibility, but it is not the most likely option given that the sentence contains no indication that the man was physically or mentally taxed after the conversation. Communication and agreement are too vague to be the answer, and answers is not a fitting option given that it suggests that the man was seeking responses to specific questions, which is not implied in the sentence.
A fluffy chair typically refers to a comfortable and cushioned chair, often with a soft fabric. The living room is a common area of a house where people sit and relax, making it a likely location for a fluffy chair. The desk and office are typically associated with work and may have more functional chairs. The porch may also have chairs, but they are more likely to be outdoor furniture rather than the plush and cozy chairs that would be found inside a home. "Fluffy house" is not a common term and does not provide any useful information.
Oxygen is highly flammable, and when combined with a source of ignition, can lead to an explosion. This is a well-known fact and is often taught in science classes or discussed in safety guidelines. The other options do not accurately describe what can occur when starting a fire near oxygen.
The sentence suggests that the animal was killed, so it is logical to assume that the animal would be in the process of dying. The term "dies" suggests that the animal has already passed away, which contradicts the idea that it was in the process of dying. "Not living" is also not a suitable choice, as it is not a specific action that the animal was taking. "Grief" and "suicide" are unlikely choices, as they are human emotions and actions and not typically associated with animals.
The term "trash" typically refers to waste or unwanted items, which are commonly disposed of in a garbage dump. While trash may be emptied from other locations, such as a dumpster or broom closet, these options are less likely to be a primary location for trash disposal compared to a garbage dump. A state park and subway are also unlikely locations for trash disposal.
The sentence suggests that Billy thinks he is intelligent, but his attitudes are regressive, meaning he holds outdated, conservative beliefs. "Backward" means the opposite of progressive, which fits the context of the sentence. "Ignorant" could also fit the context, but it doesn't necessarily convey the idea of conservatism that is implied by "regressive." "Garish" and "annoying" are not related to the context of the sentence, and "intelligent" contradicts the idea that Billy's attitudes are regressive.
The sentence implies that when people are out and about running errands, they need to store their cars somewhere temporarily. While it is possible they may store them at home or a race track, those options are not practical in the given context. Freeways are for driving on, not storing cars, and car shows are events where people display and admire cars, not store them while running errands. Therefore, the most logical choice is a parking lot, which is a designated space for temporarily storing vehicles.
The question mentions having a large quantity of steel pens, which would require a larger storage space than a hand, desk drawer, TV stand, or farm. A warehouse would be a logical choice for storing such a large quantity of items.
The context of the sentence suggests that the teacher was discussing a prehistoric animal, the mammoth, and the time period in which it lived. The Pleistocene epoch is a well-known geological time period that lasted from about 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago and is associated with the rise and fall of many extinct animals, including mammoths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The yellow pages are a traditional phone directory that lists businesses and their contact information, including their hours of operation. Therefore, if someone needed to find out the hours that a business, such as Marmot, is open, it would be logical to consult the yellow pages. The other options, such as a hiding place or the ocean, are unlikely places to find information about a business's hours.
The sentence suggests that the back courtyard is a common feature found in every house in the neighborhood. The options "palace" and "country estate" suggest expensive and luxurious properties, which would not be common features of every house in a neighborhood. "Poor suburbs" may not necessarily have back courtyards, and "large house" does not necessarily imply the presence of a back courtyard. Therefore, "suburbs" is the most likely correct choice as this is a common feature in neighborhoods of this nature.
The word "ranch" is commonly associated with cattle and livestock, as it is a place where animals are raised for meat production. Therefore, it is likely that the question is referring to where in the country beef cattle are most commonly raised on ranches, which would make "ranch" the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that John and Seth have a problem, and John is taking legal action against Seth. The word "tensions" implies a rising level of conflict between the two parties, which is a likely outcome when one person sues another. The other options do not necessarily fit the context: "going to court" is already stated in the sentence, "resentment" may already exist and not necessarily increasing, "verdict" refers to a legal outcome and not a relationship dynamic, and "civility" is the opposite of tensions and not an appropriate answer in this context.
The verb "getting" combined with the noun "gift" suggests that the outcome of receiving a gift will be positive. The phrase "you wanted" reinforces this idea, indicating that the gift is desired and will likely bring joy. The other options, such as disappointment and anger, have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of receiving a desired gift. Headaches is also not a likely outcome of receiving a gift.
The sentence suggests that Dan was unable to play chess anymore because he had been debilitated by something. The word "debilitated" implies that it's a serious condition that prevents him from doing what he enjoys. The option "arthritis" is the most likely answer because it's a medical condition that can affect a person's ability to move their joints, including their hands for playing chess. The other options - boredom, humility, frustration, and headaches - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James chose glass walls because they allow more light into the room. This implies that the glass walls are transparent or clear so that light can pass through them. The other options, such as "inventive," "half empty," "recyclable," and "very fragile," do not have any relevance to the sentence and are not likely to be the reason why the glass walls let light in.
The sentence suggests that the sky affected the color in some way, indicating that the original beauty of the day may have been diminished. The word "overcast" also implies a lack of sunlight, which would further support the idea that the colors were not as vibrant as they could have been. "Dull" is the most appropriate choice as it accurately describes a loss of brightness or vibrancy, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that Sam valued his ability to make his own decisions and do as he pleased, which is a common attribute associated with freedom. Being a prisoner of war would severely limit his freedoms, making the desire to escape a natural response. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Gills are the organs that enable fish to extract oxygen from water, so they are essential for their survival. Fish are not able to breathe air like land animals, which means that they must have specialized respiratory structures to extract oxygen from their watery environment. Bones, tail, and no legs are physical features of fish, but they are not directly related to oxygen exchange. "See work" is unrelated to the question.
The verb "procreating" implies having children, and the sentence suggests that after doing so, some people struggle with something that leads them to turn to the government for assistance. The phrase "added responsibilities" is a common way to describe the challenges that come with having children, such as financial burdens, time constraints, and other lifestyle changes. The other options may also come with added responsibilities, but they are not directly connected to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John was on a business trip for a company-sponsored event. It is common for companies to hold events at convention centers, which are designed to accommodate large groups for meetings, conferences, and trade shows. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as business interviews could take place anywhere, Michigan is a state and not a specific location, resorts are typically associated with leisure travel, and cities could refer to any urban area.
The phrase "used by a single family" suggests that the entrance hall in question is part of a private residence rather than a public building or institution like a school or large building. The options "person" and "mansion" are more specific types of houses that could also have an entrance hall used by a single family.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for guests and has arranged cookies on something. It is common to arrange cookies on a plate when serving them to guests, which makes "plate" the most likely answer. The other options are unlikely because a jar may not be big enough or appropriate for cookies, a house is not a place to set out cookies, a mouth is not something to set out cookies on and a hubcap is not typically used for serving food.
The sentence clearly states that Sean intentionally made a mistake on the test, ruling out options such as "accident" and "correction". The word "torment" does not seem appropriate in this context, and "success" and "correct answer" are unlikely to be the reasons for intentionally making a mistake on a test. Therefore, "on purpose" is the most appropriate answer.
Typing involves the physical act of pressing keys on a keyboard to input letters and characters into a computer or other device. While thinking and having a nice keyboard may be helpful, they are not essential to typing. Digital dexterity, or the ability to use one's fingers in a coordinated and precise manner, is important for efficient typing. Speed is also a desirable skill for typing, but it is still secondary to the primary action of pressing keys.
The question is asking specifically about human nerves, which are found in the human body. The other options (possum, animal, organism) are too broad and could refer to a variety of different organisms. Fingertips are a part of the human body, but the question is asking about nerves in general, not just in a specific part of the body.
The sentence suggests that the human is thinking deeply about something, which is a common expression used to describe being in a state of deep thought. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Jellyfish are marine creatures that live in the water, specifically in the ocean. Therefore, it can be inferred that people may swim in the same place where jellyfish live. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
Toothpaste is commonly used for oral hygiene, so it is likely to be found in places where people brush their teeth. The bathroom and medicine cabinet are both common locations for storing toothpaste. The sink may also be a possible location, but it is not as specific as the bathroom or medicine cabinet. The kitchen and mouth are unlikely locations for toothpaste as it is not typically used for cooking or to be kept in the mouth for an extended period of time.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to coffee since it mentions a "cup of hot brew" and a "free refill." The word "little" suggests that the customers liked something about the coffee shop specifically. The other options don't seem to fit the context as well, as they are not necessarily associated with coffee or free refills.
The question refers to people who use a puck for their living, which is a clear reference to ice hockey players. Ice hockey is played on a hockey rink, and it is where players typically go at the end of their work day. The other options do not align with the context of the question.
The sentence indicates that Danny wrote an address on the box, suggesting that he intends to send it somewhere. The most logical place for him to take the box in order to send it would be the post office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jim talked without pause, which indicates a continuous or uninterrupted pattern of speech. The word "constantly" is the best choice to describe this rate of talking, as it means without stopping or pausing. The other options may have some overlap in meaning, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence. "Always forever" is repetitive and redundant, while "all day" suggests a specific time frame rather than a pattern of behavior.
The word "young people" suggests that the reading material is likely to be aimed at children or young adults. Weasels are common characters in children's stories and fables, so it is likely that young people would read about them in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Mary is suggesting an alternative to salt that can add flavor to John's salad. Vinegar is a common ingredient used as a salad dressing and can add a tangy flavor to the dish. Peppers, black pepper, and cured meat are not commonly used as salad dressings, while "adding flavor" is too vague and not specific to the context of the sentence.
Lizards are known to be skilled climbers, and rock walls provide the perfect surface for them to grip onto and climb up. The other options do not provide a suitable surface for lizards to climb on - a stream bed would be too wet, a plane is too smooth and flat, a garden may have plants but not surfaces for climbing, and the great outdoors is too broad and doesn't specify any particular surface.
The question is asking about the location people would go to after they pick up some food to buy in a store. The most common reason people would need to leave the area after picking up food is to use the restroom. The other choices do not have any relevance to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the mom is watching her children play in the rain and expects them to get dirty as a result. "Getting dirty" is the only option that directly relates to this context. "Being dirty" and "get messy" are not appropriate because they are not happening yet, and "get messy" may not necessarily be related to getting wet in the rain. "Getting wet" is a possibility, but since the focus is on the children getting dirty, it is not the best answer.
The question suggests that the map is for a specific type of location that can only be accessed on foot. Amusement parks often have maps that show the locations of various rides, attractions, and amenities that can only be reached by foot. Neither the cafeteria, classroom, truck stop, nor gas station have anything to do with locations that can only be walked to.
The sentence mentions the need to walk while playing the trumpet, which suggests a marching band. Marching bands typically perform while marching in parades or on a football field during halftime shows, and members must be able to play their instruments while moving. The other options do not involve walking and performing at the same time.
The sentence suggests that the person's speech was difficult to understand after getting drunk, which is a common symptom of slurred speech. Slurred speech is a condition where the person's speech is slow, distorted, and difficult to understand, which can happen when the person's brain is affected by alcohol. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Jumping rope is a popular form of aerobic exercise that involves continuously jumping up and down while swinging a rope under your feet. Aerobic exercise is known to have various health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. The other options, such as smiling, pleasure, and sweating, do not have a clear connection to how jumping rope can affect your body above your shoulders.
The context suggests that large guard dogs are being discussed and it is likely that people feel fear or intimidation when they see them because of their size and reputation for being protective. The option "anxious" could also be possible, but the word "frightening" is a stronger and more direct choice. The options "fleas" and "found outside" are not relevant to the question, and "faithful" does not accurately reflect the emotional response people have towards guard dogs.
The sentence suggests that dreaming scary things can result in a negative feeling upon waking up. Nightmares are commonly associated with unpleasant or frightening dreams, which is the most likely result of dreaming scary things. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
While art can have many positive effects, such as promoting communication and providing a sense of pleasure or recognition, it can also be controversial. Art can challenge societal norms, provoke strong emotional reactions, or be interpreted in different ways by different people. This can sometimes lead to controversy, criticism, or even censorship of the art.
The sentence suggests that the game being discussed includes various types of spaces, such as "chance" and another type that is similar in nature to "chance". The only option that fits this description is "community chest", which is a space on the board where players draw a card that may grant them rewards or penalties based on chance. The other options ("sure thing", "skill", "for sure", and "bingo") do not match the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that having "beauty" is contrasted with something else. Since "beauty" is a positive descriptor, it makes sense that the opposite would be something negative, such as "ugliness." The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
Classical stringed instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass, are commonly used in classical music, particularly in orchestral and chamber music settings. A string quartet is a type of chamber ensemble that consists of four stringed instruments (two violins, a viola, and a cello) and is typically used to perform classical music compositions. The other options, including concert, music store, rock band, and barbershop, are not typically associated with the use of classical stringed instruments.
The question suggests that the speaker wants to listen to the movie, which implies that they need to be able to hear the movie's audio. Paying attention, closing eyes, being very quiet or telling someone to shut up may help with focusing on the audio, but they do not help with the main goal of listening to the movie.
The sentence suggests that the mother is looking forward to going somewhere and getting a whole new house to decorate. The word "excitement" is the most appropriate answer since it conveys a positive emotion that is consistent with the context of the sentence. The other options may not be as relevant or appropriate given the context.
Banks are often concentrated in specific areas known as financial centers, where other financial institutions and businesses are also located. This concentration allows for easy access to banking services and financial expertise for businesses and individuals in the area. Main streets may have some banks, but they are less likely to have a large concentration of them. City, subway station, and grocery store do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that yelling is meant to redirect a person who is going in another direction. Turning around is the most logical action to take in response to the sudden loud noise, while the other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the mixer works with a band, which is a common activity in a recording studio. The comparison to a NASA engineer in a control room implies that the mixer has a high level of control over the sound, which is also a characteristic of a recording studio. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that playing basketball carelessly may result in a negative outcome. Knee injuries are a common occurrence in basketball, especially when players are not cautious and accidentally twist or hyperextend their knees. Losing or having fun are not necessarily negative outcomes and sweating and pain may not be directly related to playing basketball carelessly.
The question specifies that it is asking about a building in Washington D.C. that has the most books. The Library of Congress is a well-known building in Washington D.C. that also happens to be the largest library in the world. It contains millions of books, manuscripts, maps, and other documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that doing housework is a physically demanding activity, which can lead to exhaustion or feeling extremely tired. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Boredom and arguments are emotional responses that are not necessarily related to physical labor, while magic powers and headache are unlikely outcomes of doing housework.
The question implies that there is a common trait shared among most birds. One of the most notable characteristics of birds is their ability to fly, which is made possible by their wings. While some birds may not have the ability to fly, such as flightless birds like penguins and ostriches, the majority of birds are known for this distinctive feature. "Beak" is a physical characteristic, while "learn to fly" is not necessarily shared by all birds.
Perjury involves giving false testimony under oath, which is essentially lying while under legal obligation to tell the truth. The other options do not accurately or directly relate to the act of perjury. Joining a jury, for example, is not related to perjury at all.
Atheists typically believe in the finality of death, and that there is no afterlife or continuation of consciousness after the body dies. The options "unable to work," "born again," and "body decays" do not accurately reflect this belief, while "no longer exist" and "would cease to exist" suggest the idea of non-existence after death.
The question is asking about the consequence of living for an extended amount of time, which is commonly associated with aging and ultimately, death. Palpitations and perspiration are medical conditions that may occur during life but are not directly related to the extended nature of living. Making friends is a social activity that may occur throughout one's life but is not related to the duration of life.
The word "dreaded" suggests that the child was afraid or unhappy about something. The phrase "fall and having to" implies that there is an event or action that the child is not looking forward to. Among the given choices, only "go to school" fits this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the phrase "fall and having to."
The sentence suggests that cow farms have an unpleasant odor, which is why they are typically located away from populated areas. The term "rural" refers to areas that are sparsely populated and generally characterized by agriculture and farming, making it the correct choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Playing a musical instrument, such as the guitar, is usually associated with creating or making music. It involves learning how to strum or pluck the strings to produce different sounds and notes. While listening to music may inspire someone to pick up the guitar, the purpose of actually playing it is to make music. Arthritis and obesity are health conditions that are not directly related to playing guitar, and singing refers to a separate activity that may be combined with guitar playing, but is not the main purpose.
A hand is a body part that is located at the end of the arm and is used for grasping, holding, and manipulating objects. It has fingers and a thumb that allow for fine motor movements such as writing and typing. The other options do not accurately describe what a hand is.
To accomplish something in a short amount of time, one would need to move quickly and efficiently. The phrase "make haste" means to hurry or move quickly, which would be appropriate in this situation. The other options do not relate to completing a task quickly, for example "make trouble" would have the opposite effect of hindering progress.
The word "attraction" implies a romantic or sexual interest, which typically involves flirting as a precursor to other physical displays of affection such as hugging and kissing. "Love else" and "love another" do not make sense in the context of the question and are not commonly associated with initial romantic attraction.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a bench seat, which typically has seats on either side and a middle seat. The youngest person in the group is always stuck in the middle seat, suggesting that she never gets the "outsides" of the bench seat. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence - "left" and "right" are specific positions that don't necessarily relate to the bench seat, "window" is a feature that may or may not be present, and "extremes" and "outer" don't really have any clear connection to the sentence.
Red Lobster is a well-known chain restaurant in the United States that specializes in seafood dishes, which matches the items listed in the question (crab, shrimp, and fish). The other options do not relate to seafood or dining, and therefore can be eliminated as choices.
The phrase "bringing suit" typically refers to initiating a legal action or lawsuit. The likely "end" or outcome of such a legal action would be a ruling, typically by a judge or jury, which would determine the outcome of the case. The other options, such as tensions, randomness, swimming, do not make sense in the context of legal action or lawsuit. "Going to court" is a close option, but it is not as specific as "ruling" which directly relates to a legal decision made by a court or judge.
The context of the sentence suggests that clouds are something that typically occurs outside and not inside of a structure such as a house. The other options (top of a mountain, ground level, air, and sky) are all places where clouds are commonly seen or expected to be seen.
The sentence suggests that the location of the freeway is a country that uses miles instead of kilometers as its primary unit of measurement. America is one such country, as the United States uses miles for long distances on its freeways and highways. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence, making them unlikely candidates for the correct answer.
The sentence mentions that Friday was being interrogated for ten hours, which implies that he was likely experiencing fatigue from answering questions for such an extended period. The option "sharing information" is unlikely because the sentence suggests that Friday didn't want to answer questions. The options "rich" and "teaching" are unrelated to the context of the sentence, and "boredom" does not accurately capture what Friday was feeling.
The context of the sentence suggests that Joe is a musician who needs a replacement cymbal for his instrument. Out of the given choices, a music store would be the most likely place to find cymbals for sale. A marching band typically uses a specific type of cymbal that may not be suitable for Joe's needs, and a symphony orchestra typically does not use cymbals as extensively as a drumkit musician would. Furthermore, a grocery store would not carry musical equipment.
The sentence implies that James only wore his suit to court when he heard a certain thing. The most logical reason for this would be that he was only willing to dress up for a momentous occasion, such as a verdict being reached in his case. The other options do not provide a reason for James' behavior.
The phrase "routine checkup" suggests that the question is related to a medical appointment. A needle is commonly used in a medical setting for blood tests or vaccinations, which are typically done during a checkup at a doctor's office. The other options, such as "sewing basket," "eat cake," and "haystack," do not relate to the medical context of the question. While a hospital may also have needles, a routine checkup would typically be done at a doctor's office.
The mention of a tree and other trees surrounding it suggests that the bald eagle made its nest in a wooded area, most likely a forest. Forests provide ample opportunities for bald eagles to build their nests and find prey, making it a common habitat for these majestic birds. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable habitat for a bald eagle.
The sentence refers to the part of the apple that is left behind after eating, which suggests that the answer should be a part of the apple itself. The grocery store and farmers market are locations where apples can be purchased, and the stems and seeds inside are parts that are typically removed before eating. The peel, however, is typically left behind after eating an apple and discarded.
Saying hello is a common greeting used when meeting someone for the first time. It is a friendly way to acknowledge someone's presence and start a conversation. Smiling and shaking hands are also common greetings, but the sentence specifically mentions the person saying hello. Goodbye is not a suitable option as it is used when parting ways, while greet is too broad and does not provide enough context.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place that sells eggs along with many other types of food, which is a characteristic commonly associated with supermarkets. Supermarkets typically offer a wide range of food products, including eggs, and are common places for grocery shopping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is struggling with expressing their thoughts using proper language, which indicates a difficulty with constructing sentences. This implies that the person may not know how to choose the right words to convey their meaning effectively. Therefore, the correct answer would be "word sentence". The other options do not address the issue of expressing thoughts with proper language.
The sentence is asking for the opposite of an odd number, which is a mathematical concept. In math, even numbers are defined as numbers that are divisible by 2 without a remainder, while odd numbers are not. Therefore, the opposite of an odd number is an even number. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of even and odd numbers.
The sentence suggests that the dog did not venture far from the house to find the stick, as the man could tell it came from a nearby small area. The options "grass", "forest", and "woods" suggest a larger and more distant natural area. "Yard" and "outside" are more likely to refer to the immediate surroundings of the house, but "yard" is the more specific and likely option, as it implies a defined and managed area adjacent to the house where the stick could have come from.
Old newspapers are often kept for reference and historical purposes, and libraries are common places to find them. Libraries often have archives of newspapers that go back several years and are available for public use. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that travellers need a place to stop and take a break from driving, specifically to stretch their legs. A rest area, also known as a rest stop, is a designated location along a roadway for motorists to rest, use the restroom, or take a break from driving. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not provide a place for motorists to stretch their legs during a road trip.
The sentence suggests that a person who is a weasel tends to work in a certain type of employment. Used car lots are often associated with the stereotype of being places where dishonest or tricky sales tactics are used, which may be why a person who is compared to a weasel would be associated with this type of workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Learning about a subject is typically done with the goal of increasing one's understanding and knowledge in that area. The other options do not align with the typical motivations for learning, as "change" is too broad and could apply to any activity, while "elation" and "headache" are emotional states that are not direct outcomes of learning. "Boredom" may be a common feeling associated with unengaging materials, but it is not a goal someone would have when seeking information.
When considering what is usually next to a door, the options of apartment, office, building, and kitchen do not give any indication of what would be physically located next to a door. However, the option of wall is a logical choice as walls are typically adjacent to doors. Therefore, knowing that walls are commonly found next to doors can help in selecting the correct answer.
Fish are often scared of boats since they can pose a threat to their safety by disturbing their natural habitat, creating waves that may upset their balance or scare them, or accidentally catching them with fishing equipment. The other options may not necessarily pose a threat to fish, and some may even be favorable to their survival, such as a pond or stream, which provide a natural environment for them. A market or end of line are irrelevant in this context.
The sentence suggests that Joe had trouble with city zoning laws, which indicates that the problem was related to the legal requirements for businesses in a particular area. The phrase "neighborhood barbershop" implies a small, local business, which may need to conform to specific zoning regulations that restrict the type of businesses allowed in residential or commercial areas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person moved down the river while their partner remained behind. The word "upstream" indicates a direction opposite to the flow of the river, which would be where the partner remained. The other options ("upstairs," "inside," "over," and "above") do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "killing" is commonly associated with causing death or taking a life, which is often considered a crime. While there may be other actions associated with killing such as feeling anger or laughing in certain contexts, the most direct and accurate answer is to "commit crime" because it directly relates to the act of taking a life. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "spend" suggests that the person is looking for a place to use their money. Supermarkets and banks are places where people typically spend money, either on groceries or financial transactions. Car shows and art shows are not necessarily places where people would spend money, as they are more for browsing and admiring than purchasing. A water fountain is not a place where people typically spend money at all.
The context of the sentence suggests that the executives were discussing something related to their work, as they were walking through the lobby. The option "business plan" is the most directly related to this context, as it refers to a plan for a company's future success. The other options, such as "opera," "office building," "receptionist," and "game plan," are not directly related to the context of the sentence and are therefore less likely to be correct answers.
The sentence implies that the food is already prepared and ready to be eaten, which suggests that it is most likely already on a plate. The other options may be places where food is stored or prepared, but they are not the last step before consumption. The stomach is technically where the food ends up after being eaten, but the question asks about the last place before being eaten.
The reception desk is typically the first point of contact for visitors to a business, and it is usually located in the lobby or entrance area of the building. The lobby is the area where people enter the building, and it often contains seating areas, a reception desk, and other amenities such as restrooms and vending machines. The other options do not make sense as a location for a reception desk in a business context.
The sentence suggests that the subject was critical of his own team while doing something else with the opponents. The word "opponents" implies that the subject is involved in some sort of competition or game, and if he is critical of his own team, it is unlikely that he would be trivializing or dismissing the importance of the game. Furthermore, the word "praising" suggests a positive evaluation, which would contrast with the negative criticism directed towards his own team. The other options either have a negative connotation or do not provide a clear contrast to the subject's critical evaluation of his own team.
A lounge lizard is a slang term for someone who frequents lounges or bars, often dressed in fancy or flashy clothing. Since jazz clubs are a common type of lounge, it makes sense that a lounge lizard would like to hang out in a jazz club. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they are not places where lounges or bars would typically be found.
The question is asking for the cheapest way to get food. Stealing is illegal and not a viable option. Purchasing food from a specific website may not necessarily be the cheapest option, as prices can vary. Eating in this context is not a method of obtaining food. Working for food may be a possibility, but it may not always be the cheapest option. Growing food can be an affordable way of obtaining food, especially if done at home or in a community garden. Therefore, the correct answer is "grow food."
The term "skepticism" is often used to describe an attitude of questioning or doubting something. This implies that the person is not completely convinced or has reservations about the truth or validity of the thing in question. The other options, such as "doubt" or "disbelief," may have similar connotations, but "skepticism" is the most precise answer that fits the context of the sentence. "Deny" and "depression" do not fit the context at all.
The question implies that Bill is looking for a way to learn from a teacher, which makes attending school the most logical choice. While reading a book can also provide knowledge, it does not offer the opportunity to ask questions or receive personalized guidance, which Bill may desire. Memorizing or understanding better are actions that require prior knowledge or materials, which Bill may not have access to. Church may offer some educational opportunities, but attending school is a more direct and comprehensive way to learn.
A mobile heat source is something that can be moved to different locations to provide heat. Out of the given choices, only fire meets this criteria as it can be created anywhere with the right materials and provides heat when burning. A bedroom, solar energy, and coal or wood are not typically mobile heat sources, and a car may have a heating system but is not considered a heat source itself.
The sentence indicates that the person wants to buy food items, which suggests they should go to a place that sells groceries. The term "grocery store" specifically refers to a retail store that sells food and household items, making it the most relevant option among the choices. The other options, such as "refrigerator," "horse's mouth," "desert," and "greengrocer," do not make sense in this context.
The word "diving" suggests that the activity was more intense than just sightseeing. The question also implies that the activity was chosen for a specific reason, as opposed to just being a means to get from one place to another. The word "exhilaration" suggests that the people were diving through the cave for a thrill or excitement. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah went to a restaurant that specializes in the cuisine and atmosphere of the American West, which is a cultural region that includes states like Texas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "swamp" typically refers to a wetland area characterized by waterlogging, which is commonly found in Louisiana. Additionally, Louisiana is known for its alligators and snakes, making it a likely place to find a snake in a swamp. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James looked at a menu and placed an order, which implies that he is at a place where food and drink are being served. Of the options given, a cafe is the most likely location for this to happen, as cafes typically have menus and serve food and drink. The other options, such as a shop, internet site or advertisement, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that many horses are brown in color, and mentions a common misconception that their milk might taste like chocolate because of their color. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "heifer" suggests that this question is referring to a female cow, which is commonly raised for meat and dairy. Texas is known for its large cattle industry, with over 13 million head of cattle, making it the largest cattle producing state in the United States. Therefore, it is likely that the attitude of the heifer is a reference to the temperament and behavior of Texas cattle. The other options do not provide any context or clues as to why a heifer's attitude might be associated with a particular state or location.
The sentence suggests that the area being referred to is located between two significant bodies of water (oceans) and land masses (continents). Therefore, it is more likely that the area is wide in extent rather than narrow or limited. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "talking" in the sentence suggests that the therapist is referring to the need for better communication between the individuals. The therapist is likely suggesting that the first step in improving their relationship is to talk and communicate effectively with one another. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The process of digesting food begins in the mouth, where food is broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva. From there, it travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where enzymes and acids break down the food further before it moves into the small intestine for absorption. The other options, such as pantry, kitchen, and plate, do not accurately refer to a part of the digestive system where food is processed.
The word "fresh" implies that the tomatoes have not been stored for long periods of time, and instead have been recently harvested. Therefore, it is likely that the freshest tomatoes can be found at a market or farm stand, where they are sold shortly after being picked. The other options such as pizza, squashed or even the refrigerator do not guarantee fresh tomatoes, and the phrase "on pizza" is not a location where the tomatoes can be found but rather where they may be served.
The sentence implies that standing in line all day can be physically exhausting. This makes "get tired" the most likely answer, as the other options do not relate to physical fatigue. "Learn a new way to bake bread" and "order" are not activities that typically result from standing in line for an extended period of time. "Tiredness" is very similar to "get tired" and may also be a suitable answer, but "get tired" is more specific in describing the action that is likely to occur. "Fidgeting" may be a result of being restless from standing in line for too long, but it does not describe the overall physical impact on the body.
The sentence suggests that James is concerned about losing value when he does something specific. This implies that James is experiencing inflation, which is causing the value of his money to decrease over time. The best option among the choices is "save money" because saving money allows James to preserve its value, even in the face of inflation. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not address the issue of inflation.
The sentence suggests that the fox saw itself wearing silly clothes on a piece of paper, which likely indicates that the fox was looking at a representation of itself in a printed or drawn medium. This is most commonly associated with storybooks, which often feature animal characters wearing clothing and engaging in anthropomorphic activities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person felt pride after improving their mile time, indicating that they put in effort to train and become better. The options "paint house," "compete against," "tell many people about," and "pass class" do not have any clear relationship to the context of feeling pride after improving one's mile time.
The context of the sentence suggests that Nate washed his personal silverware and put it away in a place where it would be easily accessible for future use. The most logical location for this would be the kitchen, where plates, glasses, and other utensils are typically stored. The other options (bedroom, table, restaurant, and cupboard) are less likely to be the location of where Nate stored his silverware.
Having sex without protection puts individuals at risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of unwanted pregnancy, which can lead to emotional, physical, and financial consequences. While sex may feel pleasurable in the moment, it is important to consider the potential consequences and take steps to minimize risk. The choice "bliss" does not accurately reflect the potential consequences of unprotected sex.
The sentence suggests that the bookshop specializes in course texts, which are typically used by students. The option "student union" is the most relevant choice because it is a common gathering place for students on a college or university campus, and would therefore be a natural location for a bookshop specializing in course texts. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A laser is commonly used in scientific and research settings, such as in laboratory experiments for physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is not commonly used in cd players, aircraft, hospitals, or cdrom drives, which eliminates those options.
The sentence suggests that fighting inflation has a negative impact on the public, which is likely to lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction. Inflation often leads to higher prices and reduced purchasing power, which can be frustrating for consumers. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence.
The verb "fiddling" typically refers to playing the violin, so the most appropriate answer in this context would be "make music". Dancing about, bluegrass music, and drop are not related to the act of playing the violin. While "playing" is technically correct, it is not as specific or contextual as "make music" in this sentence.
The phrase "evening of remembering" suggests a time of reflecting on the past, which often leads to nostalgia. Nostalgia refers to a sentimental longing for the past, which is a common feeling when remembering past events or experiences. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the act of remembering or reflecting on the past.
The context of the sentence suggests that the action being described is the act of drinking alcohol to the point of becoming intoxicated. The term "getting drunk" specifically refers to the effects of alcohol consumption, and the other options listed are synonyms or technical terms for alcohol, but do not capture the meaning of the phrase in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James installed curtains in his own personal space in order to block out light from a particular source, which is likely his television. Therefore, it is most likely that he hung his curtains in his own house rather than at a show, grocery store, department store, or theater which would not be his personal space.
The sentence suggests that Sean was not counting on the weather to stay nice because he knew it could change quickly. This implies that the weather in the area is known to be unpredictable and prone to sudden shifts in conditions. The other options either do not fit with the context of the sentence or are not supported by any information provided.
The question suggests that the context is related to obtaining a bean as an ingredient for cooking or consumption. While some of the options such as cooking pot, coffee, and beantown are associated with beans, they do not provide a clear solution to obtaining a bean when you don't have one. Neighbor may seem like a viable option, but it is not the best solution as it may not be practical to ask for a bean from a neighbor. The most practical and obvious option is to go to a food store where you can purchase a bean.
Hiking is a physically demanding activity that requires a lot of energy and effort. The word "utilize" in the question suggests that the answer is a type of action or process, rather than a specific location or condition. "Mountain" and "adventure" are not types of exertion, while "exercise" is too broad and could apply to any physical activity. "Shin splints" is a condition that can result from hiking, but it is not a type of exertion itself. Therefore, "physical exertion" is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that prisoners were employed to do a specific task that would be helpful in fighting something. The options "work for," "sack," "lay off," and "make redundant" do not make sense in this context. "Fire" is the only choice that fits with the idea of fighting something, and digging lines can be a technique used to contain or control a fire.
The sentence suggests that the job involves collecting cardboard, which is a commonly recycled material. The use of the phrase "special needs" may indicate that the company was specifically looking to hire someone with a disability or other special circumstances, and the task of collecting cardboard from a recycling bin might be a good fit for someone with certain physical or cognitive challenges. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the student took an unpaid membership for a reason. One possible reason for taking an unpaid membership is to gain experience in a particular field (e.g. volunteer work). Taking notes and studying books do not necessarily require a membership, and capitalist exploitation does not make sense in this context. "Listen carefully" might be a plausible option, but it is less likely than "gain experience" given the word choice in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the topic being discussed is science and that the person being referred to enjoys learning about it. The phrase "like learning about" implies a desire to acquire knowledge, which is most closely associated with "gain information." The other options do not reflect a desire to obtain knowledge about science. "Experiment" and "invent" suggest actively doing science rather than learning about it, while "frustration" has a negative connotation that does not fit with the positive tone of the sentence. "Smiles" is a vague option that does not provide any meaningful information.
The question is asking for a suitable container for giving a grape as a gift. Out of the options provided, a fruit basket would be the most appropriate choice for presenting a single grape as a gift. A kitchen or field would not be suitable containers, and a bowl of fruit may be too large or contain other items that could detract from the singular grape as a gift. A box could be an option, but a fruit basket would add a decorative touch to the gift presentation.
The word "expensive" suggests that the lantern is valuable and therefore likely to be sold in a location that specializes in selling expensive or rare items. An antique shop fits this description as it typically sells vintage and valuable items. The other options, such as a collector's house or a dark place, do not necessarily imply that the lantern is expensive, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the man and the woman were unable to distinguish or differentiate between reality and lies. The word "likened" suggests that they compared their experience to something else, implying that they may have been mistaken or misled in their perception of what happened. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Taking medicine is a common method for treating illnesses and recovering from sickness. On the other hand, throwing up and exercising may not always be recommended or effective methods for recovery. Battling cancer requires a combination of treatments and a longer period of time compared to a regular illness, which makes it an unlikely choice for this question. Finally, "get better" is not a concrete action or method that a sick person can take to actively aid in their recovery.
The context of the sentence suggests that John was searching for a shirt, which is an item of clothing typically kept in a drawer. The other options - closet, chest, dresser, and suitcase - may also contain clothing but are less commonly associated with storing shirts specifically. It is important to consider the context and associations of each option to make an informed choice.
The sentence suggests that the automaton wants to save money like normal humans, which indicates that it needs to learn about a financial system. Banking is a logical choice because it refers to the system of conducting financial transactions, such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds, that is commonly used by humans. The other options, such as museum or science fiction plot, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that James's first priority was finding information, indicating that he was seeking knowledge or a better understanding of something. The other options, such as "exciting" or "gratification," do not align with the purpose of seeking information for understanding. "Hatred" and "thoughts" are also not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question refers to a mouse being found in a box, which typically suggests that the mouse is inside a container or enclosure. Out of the given choices, a cupboard is the most likely place where a box containing a mouse could be found because cupboards are commonly used to store household items and are often enclosed spaces. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question specifically asks for something that can be used to play music. The only option that directly relates to playing music is "play piano." The other options have no clear relationship to playing music, for example: "listen" is what you do when you hear music; "skate" is an activity that is unrelated to music; "fiddle" is a type of stringed instrument, but not all fiddles can play all types of music; and "have fun" is a general phrase that is not specific to music.
The sentence implies that the government has a tendency to impose control on various aspects of society or individuals, hence the word "anything." The other options don't fit, as they're either specific places (Washington D.C.) or too general (country and all of us) and don't provide the same level of specificity as "everything."
The sentence suggests that having blemish-free, flowing skin is a characteristic commonly associated with good health. This is because good health often results in clear skin and a healthy complexion. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that needlepoint requires multiple accessories, one of which is used to hold the work taut. A frame is a common accessory used in needlepoint to keep the fabric stretched tightly while working on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Policemen are typically responsible for patrolling specific areas, such as neighborhoods or business districts. They ensure that laws are being followed, respond to emergencies, and maintain public safety. Patrolling a street is a common duty for police officers, while the other options have no clear connection to the role of a police officer.
The sentence implies that the individuals are hosting guests and apologizing for the sleeping accommodations. This suggests that there is a designated guest room in the house, and that the sofa bed is a temporary solution for extra guests. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a basement, garage, or hotel would not typically have a sofa bed for guests, and horseradish is not related to the topic at all.
The sentence suggests that Sarah had to reschedule the meeting because she couldn't make it in the afternoon. She then promises to skip dinner and go to bed early, implying that the meeting will take place later that same day. Based on the options given, the most likely time for the meeting to be rescheduled to would be in the evening, after dinner. The other options (before noon, morning, before lunch) do not make sense given the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about how the shape of wood can be changed. Nailing usually does not change the shape of the wood but only attaches it to another piece of wood. Grinding and polishing can shape and smooth the surface of wood, but not its overall shape. Warping refers to the wood bending or twisting due to changes in humidity or temperature. Carving, however, refers to the act of removing pieces of wood to alter its shape, making it the correct answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is purchasing a magazine and taking it home. While a library can also provide access to magazines, they are not typically sold and taken home by patrons. "Bed" and "airport" are unlikely options as they do not typically sell magazines, and "shop" is too generic to make an assumption about the type of store. A bookstore is the most likely option since they typically sell magazines and allow customers to take them home after payment.
The sentence suggests that the answer given was not what the professor was expecting and that he/she was expecting something more complex and difficult to understand. The word 'convoluted' means complex and difficult to follow, which makes it the correct answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply a more straightforward and serious approach.
The question is asking about the potential effect of learning about science. One possible outcome is that it can inspire a "sense of wonder" as someone learns about the amazing complexity and interconnectivity of the natural world. This option is supported by the fact that science often reveals new and fascinating phenomena that can inspire awe and curiosity. The other options (scientific knowledge, intimidation, boring, become educated) are all possible outcomes of learning about science, but they do not necessarily capture the emotional response to this knowledge.
The context of the sentence mentions that there is an aquarium, which is likely to have fish in it. Since cats are natural predators and often hunt fish in the wild, it is likely that they are looking to eat the fish in the aquarium. The other options like heat, play, drink water, and come to dinner do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A cemetery is a place where people are buried, often with headstones or other markers to commemorate their lives. Therefore, it would be a logical place to visit a monument to a deceased loved one. The other options do not have any explicit connection to death or memorials.
The sentence suggests that people are waiting for a vehicle to arrive, which is a common occurrence in airports where people wait for their flights or for someone to pick them up. People may sleep in a chair due to long layovers or delays, and this is a common image associated with airports. The other options, such as bedroom or desk, do not have any clear connection to people sleeping in chairs while waiting for a vehicle.
Waging war often involves violent conflict and the use of weapons, which can result in the death of individuals involved in the fighting. This is a common and well-known consequence of war, whereas heartache, evil, and suffering are more abstract concepts that may be associated with war but do not directly describe a tangible result. Killing people is also a possible consequence of war, but it is more specific than people dying and may not always occur in every war.
The phrase "on the move" implies movement or mobility. The option "sit still" directly contradicts this movement, making it the correct answer. The other options are either synonyms (stationary, stand still, stay still) or describe a type of movement (running), which do not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there are two different approaches to communicating, with one preferring to lie and the other preferring to do something that is the opposite of lying. The last option, "state facts", aligns with this opposite approach, as stating facts is typically associated with being honest and straightforward. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence and are not opposites of lying.
The question is asking where you can find the most variety of oboe brands, so the most likely place to find a wide selection would be a music store. Orchestras and bands may have oboes, but they would typically only have a few select brands for their players to use. A case is not a location where oboes are sold, and Guitar Center is a store that specializes in guitars and other stringed instruments, so it is less likely to have a large selection of oboes.
Blowfish are marine animals that can typically be found in the ocean, so the correct answer would be a location related to the sea. The other options, such as the jungle, Cuba, or a lake do not have any connection to the habitat of blowfish. The Atlantic Ocean is a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "sea water," which directly relates to where blowfish are commonly found.
The question suggests that the drink needs to be transported from one location to another, which indicates that it should be placed in a container that can be carried easily. Of the options given, only 'backpack' fits this criteria as it is a type of bag that can be used to carry items. The other options - cup, cabinet, cardboard box, and stumble - do not seem like practical choices for storing a drink during transportation.
The sentence suggests that the action being described has a negative impact on someone else's life. Baking biscuits or making progress are unlikely to have negative consequences for someone else. Making haste or taking time may affect one's own life but not necessarily someone else's. "Making trouble" is the only option that implies the action makes life harder for someone else.
The sentence provides a contrast between the previous reports of bad weather and the actual weather on the wedding day, which is described as gorgeous. This suggests that the weather must have improved and looked beautiful on the day of the wedding. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect the improvement in weather.
The question specifically asks about a place in the US with a lot of mines. Knowing that mines are typically associated with extraction of natural resources like coal, oil, and minerals, it is reasonable to eliminate options like ground, cambodia, and mine craft game. Additionally, mountains are often associated with mining activities, but may not necessarily have a lot of mines. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, has a strong history of coal mining, making it a likely answer choice.
The sentence suggests that Charlie is focused on experiencing something that makes him feel good and wants to make the most out of it. The only option that fits this context is "fun." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Billy stole a cheap item, which is commonly found in department stores. Jewellers typically sell high-priced items such as gold, diamonds and precious stones. The guard tower and police station are unlikely places where watches would be sold. A bedroom drawer is a place where people keep their own belongings, not where one would go to shoplift.
The question is asking where the person can ride their bike in order to take graduate classes, implying that they want to ride their bike to a location where they can attend classes. The options "schoolyard" and "street" do not necessarily suggest a location where one can attend classes. "Netherlands" is a country and therefore does not provide a specific location. "Bike path" may suggest a route to take, but does not indicate a specific destination for taking classes. "University" is the best answer because it directly relates to attending classes and is a common location for graduate studies.
Contraceptive devices are typically sold at pharmacies or drug stores. These stores usually have a section dedicated to sexual health and family planning, and may offer a variety of options such as condoms, birth control pills, and diaphragms. It is unlikely that a person would give you a contraceptive device, and it is not appropriate to obtain one from an adult squirrel or a bedroom.
The sentence implies that the scene is taking place in a location where glass is present and that there are people causing a disturbance nearby. Of the options given, only a hockey game is commonly associated with both glass (as in the barriers around the rink) and rowdy fans who might bang on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the speaker is willing to fight their enemy even if it means risking their own life, which is a common expression. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that customers have the option to shop outside, which is typically only found in a mall with outdoor shopping areas. A market may have outdoor vendor stalls, but it is usually not considered a place where customers can shop outside in a recreational sense. The ocean does not have any connection to shopping, and neither does a restaurant or a bookstore.
Nightmares are often associated with negative emotions such as fear and anxiety, which can leave a person feeling uncomfortable or unsettled even after they wake up. While it is possible that a person may experience a headache or shock after a nightmare, discomfort is the most general and likely answer given the context of the question. The other options do not fit with common experiences associated with waking up from a nightmare.
The phrase "in the ground" suggests that the flower is located outside, rather than in a vase or on a windowsill. A park is a logical place to find a flower growing naturally in the ground. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that the conversation among friends is lighthearted and nostalgic, so it is likely that someone will share a funny or amusing anecdote which will result in laughter. The other options (exchanging information, agreement, staring, social approval) do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the comforter was used for snuggling in front of the TV, which is an activity typically done in a living room or family room setting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The washing machine would be used to clean the comforter, the cedar chest would be used for storage or display purposes, and outside and bedroom are unlikely options for a cuddling blanket.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to fishing, and the question is asking about what one needs to do to bring fish home. The correct answer is to go fishing, as that is the activity that involves catching fish. The other options do not relate to fishing, or do not make sense in the given context.
An account book is typically used to keep track of financial transactions, such as income and expenses. It is commonly used by individuals and businesses alike to maintain accurate records for budgeting, tax purposes, and financial planning. The other choices do not relate to the purpose of an account book. A desk drawer and purse may be used to store the book, but they do not describe its function. A bank is a financial institution, not a tool for tracking financial records, and keeping track of emails is a different activity altogether.
The use of the term "Socratic dialogue" suggests that the discussion was taking place in an educational setting, as Socratic dialogue is a method commonly used in classrooms to facilitate critical thinking and exploration of ideas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of a discussion using Socratic dialogue.
The sentence suggests that the listed characteristics are associated with a particular type of human population. The options "country" and "city" are too broad and do not encompass all of the listed characteristics. "Canada" and "citizen" are specific to a country, and are not related to the context of the sentence. "Civilization," on the other hand, is commonly used to describe a society with advanced institutions, technologies, and a system of record-keeping. Planned cities and workers are also commonly associated with civilizations. Therefore, the correct answer is "civilization."
The sentence mentions "Discovery" and "starring a shark," which suggests that the question is referring to a TV program by that name. The other choices are geographic locations or weather phenomena, which do not fit with the context of a TV program.
The context of the sentence suggests that the singing human is likely part of a musical group or ensemble. A band is a common musical group that includes a singer, so this would be the most logical answer. The other choices - aircraft, outer-space, space shuttle, and factory - are not typically associated with singing humans in a musical context.
The phrase "on the ground" implies that the person in the sentence is physically lying on the ground, which is often the result of falling down or sustaining an injury. "Peace" and "forgetfulness" do not seem to relate to physical actions that would result in someone being on the ground, while "death" is too extreme for the context given.
In most states in the United States, including Washington, stabbing someone to death is considered murder and is punishable by imprisonment. Capital punishment (the death penalty) is only applied in certain cases and is not the default punishment for murder. Killing and hurt are too vague to be valid options, and enlightenment is not a punishment at all.
The sentence suggests that John enjoyed making up stories or scenarios in his mind, which is a characteristic commonly associated with daydreaming. Daydreaming involves creating vivid mental images or fantasies, which can be a fun and entertaining way to pass the time. The other options may be related to pretending, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The mention of snow suggests that the tourist was likely in a colder climate or area that experiences snowfall. The options of Canada and mountains both fit this description, as Canada is known for its cold winters and mountainous regions also commonly experience snow. The option of roof doesn't make sense in the context of capturing pictures of snow, and the repetition of ground as an option is likely an error.
The sentence suggests that people who are stressed tend to have issues with remembering things. Stress is known to affect cognitive abilities like memory and attention, which can result in forgetfulness or difficulty recalling information. The other options do not have a direct correlation to the topic of stress and memory.
The fact that the bald eagle avoided big cities suggests that it preferred to be in areas with less human population and development. The option "countryside" refers to rural areas that are typically less populated and developed than cities. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Lilly was seeking solitude and a peaceful environment, which is commonly associated with being away from other people and noise. The option "top of mountain" provides the most logical choice for this type of setting as it is away from the hustle and bustle of daily life and provides a peaceful and secluded atmosphere. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the reason the job was not finished was not due to a lack of effort but rather a lack of something else. The word "enough" suggests that the supplies may have been insufficient to complete the job. "Possessing" does not fit the context of the sentence as it refers to ownership rather than availability. "Plethora" suggests an abundance of supplies, which contradicts the idea that the job was not completed due to a lack of supplies. "Satisfaction" does not fit the context of the sentence as it does not relate to the completion of the job. "Availability" supports the idea that the supplies were not accessible or present, but "enough" is a better fit because it indicates that even if the supplies were available, they were not sufficient to complete the job.
The sentence suggests that James disposed of his paper coffee cup after crushing it, which means he must have put it in a bin or bin-like container. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence, as leaving a crushed cup on a coffee table or desk, putting it in a cupboard, or leaving it at Starbucks would not be considered its "proper place."
The sentence suggests that the person being teased was mistaken for a girl because they were caught sitting down in the locker room bathroom. This is typically associated with bathroom activities such as using the toilet or urinal, and in this case, the correct answer is "pee". The other options do not make sense in this context.
The phrase "third rock from the sun" is often used to refer to the planet Earth, which is the third planet in our solar system. Minerals are naturally occurring substances found on Earth, so it makes sense that the correct answer is Earth. The other options, such as Nebraska, multivitamin, and Michigan, do not have any association with minerals or the context of the sentence. The word "ore" is associated with minerals, but it is too vague on its own and could refer to any planet or even asteroids or moons.
The word "opera" refers to a type of musical theater that features singing as its primary mode of expression. Therefore, it is likely that people would sing in an opera setting. Singing is not typically expected or encouraged in other locations such as an apartment, supermarket, train station, or conference.
The sentence indicates that the person's fear of skiing is related to an accident they had previously experienced. It is common for skiing accidents to result in broken bones, so the person likely wants to avoid this type of injury in general. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that waging war is often viewed in a negative light, as it is considered to be something. The use of the word "evil" directly implies a negative connotation, whereas the other choices (suffering, killing people, people dying, a party) do not necessarily convey the same negative meaning.
The sentence suggests that the science major is interested in digging in the earth, which is a common activity in geography when studying soil, rocks, and landforms. Additionally, the favorite class of the science major is mentioned, and geography often involves the study of physical geography, including things like geological formations and topographic maps. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the reward was intended for a dog, as bones are a common treat for dogs. The phrase "give a bone" also implies that the human was presenting the bone to the dog as a gift or reward. Out of the given choices, only "dog's mouth" is directly related to the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "skeleton" and "human body," do not make sense in this context.
The word "opposite" in the question implies that we are looking for a word that has the opposite meaning or is antonymous to "little." "Big" is the best option for the opposite of "little" as it has an opposite meaning and is commonly used to describe something that is large or of a considerable size. The other options either do not have a clear opposite meaning to "little" or are unrelated choices.
The sentence suggests that Jane carried her related literature with her when she entered the room to speak with others, which implies that she kept it in a bag. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that although people have different desires in life, there is something common that they all ultimately seek. The phrase "a little bit of" may indicate that this is something relatively small or subtle. Out of the given options, happiness is the most likely candidate as it is a commonly sought-after emotion that can be experienced in small amounts. The other options are either too specific or do not fit the overall tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the statistician and demographer had different opinions about the importance of an anomaly. The use of the word "contrarian" implies that the demographer is likely opposed to the statistician's view. The word "trivial" means unimportant or insignificant, which fits with the demographer's opposition to the statistician's view. The other options are not necessarily opposites of important and do not convey a clear sense of the demographer's perspective.
The word "sort" implies that the person wants to organize or categorize a pile of things. The only option that relates to this is "separate things," which suggests that the person needs to sort the pile by placing similar items together or creating distinct categories. The other options do not have any clear connection to sorting, organization, or categorization.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to eat the food immediately, which implies that it needs to be put on a surface that is suitable for consuming food. Cups and jars are typically used for liquids or smaller items, while the kitchen and pantry are locations rather than surfaces to put food on. Plates are the most common surface for placing and eating food, so it is the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that people with money often want to acquire things, which is commonly associated with owning objects. Selling items and selling food may be related to making money, but they do not necessarily imply the desire to want things. Telling the truth and learning from each other do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Flame-broiling is a cooking method used by Burger King, whereas McDonald's usually fries their hamburgers. The sentence suggests that the hamburgers were served at a fast food restaurant, so options such as "hockey game" are unlikely choices. "Cooked on grill" is a general description rather than a specific location, leaving "Burger King" as the most logical answer.
Getting married is a common way to start living life with someone else and forming a committed relationship. Making love, having children, and learning can all be part of a relationship, but they do not necessarily involve a formal commitment or legal agreement. Going to jail is not a positive or relevant option in the context of starting a life with someone else.
The sentence indicates that the medication mentioned can relieve symptoms, which suggests it is meant to treat physical conditions or ailments. The word "pain" is commonly associated with physical discomfort or suffering, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are either unrelated or do not involve physical symptoms.
The use of the word "laws" implies that this is a regulation that applies to a wide range of establishments, suggesting that it is a legal requirement. The word "public" also indicates that the law applies to places that are open to the general public, which would include buildings like schools, hospitals, and government offices. The other options may or may not be required to have a fire extinguisher, depending on the context, but there is no clear indication that they are required by law like public buildings.
The context of the sentence suggests that the doctor gave the man dietary advice, specifically to eat vegetables. The phrase "it would help him" implies that the doctor advised the man to eat vegetables for a specific purpose. The option "good for" is too generic and could apply to any number of health benefits associated with vegetables. "Wash" and "starve" do not make sense in this context. "Fibre" could be a possible answer as vegetables are high in fiber, but the doctor's advice seems more geared towards weight loss.
The word "opposite" suggests that we are looking for a word that has a meaning that is the opposite of normal. The other options may have negative connotations, but they don't necessarily mean "opposite of normal." "Unconventional," on the other hand, means "not conforming to accepted norms or standards," which could be interpreted as the opposite of normal.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to buy a new screw to fix the problem with the kitchen drawer knob. This would require a hardware store, where they could find a wide selection of screws and other tools and hardware items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a fundamental difference between the actions of the living and the dead, and that this difference is important. The options "talk", "sometimes bad", "pollution", and "happiness" do not seem to fit this context. "Have experiences" is the most logical answer, as it is something that only the living can do. The dead cannot have any new experiences, as they are no longer alive.
The sentence suggests that James was lacking something to lead, which implies that he needed a group of people to lead. The options "army" and "school" could also fit this description, but the context of the sentence ("useless") suggests that James' lack of something to lead made him incapable of being a leader, and leading an army or school would actually require a strong leader. "Battle" and "organization" do not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, "company" is the best choice as it fits both the context of the sentence and the implied meaning.
The sentence states that a virus causes the flu and the common "what." The word "what" indicates that we are looking for a noun that is commonly associated with the flu virus. The options "disease" and "infection" could be correct, but they are too general and don't specifically relate to the flu. The option "make person sick" is too broad and does nothing to help us identify a specific word. The correct answer is "cold," because the flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses caused by viruses.
The sentence suggests that the place being referred to has borders and a large population, which rules out options like treetops and research laboratory. As for the remaining options, monkeys are often associated with the rain forest due to the fact that many species of primates live in the jungle canopies of places like the Amazon rainforest. South Africa may seem like a possibility because it does have borders, but it is not typically associated with monkeys as much as other parts of Africa. Kentucky does not have any connection to the context of the sentence as it does not contain a large population or any notable monkey populations.
The sentence describes a game played with a stick and balls, suggesting a game of billiards or pool. The phrase "hit a ball into other balls" specifically relates to the act of breaking the rack of balls at the beginning of a game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence is referring to fitting one piece with another, which is a common action in a jigsaw puzzle. A puzzle box could also involve fitting pieces together, but it is not as commonly associated with the action as a jigsaw puzzle is. Chess pieces are not typically fitted together, and a plate does not involve fitting pieces together in the same way a jigsaw puzzle does.
The phrase "too intensely" suggests that there may be negative consequences associated with studying excessively or with too much focus. The word "headaches" specifically suggests a physical symptom that is commonly associated with stress or eye strain, which could be caused by studying for extended periods of time without taking breaks or looking away from computer screens. The other options do not relate to the negative effects of intense studying.
The sentence suggests that the teacher interacts with someone regularly during the week, and it indicates that this person is part of the same profession as the teacher. The phrase "other teachers" is the only option that directly relates to the profession of teaching, making it the most likely answer. The other options either refer to a different type of interaction or are not connected to the context of the sentence.
The question specifies that the person is a woman and wants to bring a writing instrument with her. This suggests that the writing instrument needs to be portable and easily carried around. The most common place for women to carry small items like pens or pencils is in their purse. The other options do not make sense in this context: a stationery store is a place to buy writing instruments, not store them; a ball stopped is not a place to store things; a pocket may be an option for some women's clothing, but it's not universal; and a classroom is a location, not a storage option.
The sentence suggests that Bill's hands are capable of doing different things, and that he was thirsty. Therefore, it makes sense that he would use his hands to pick up a cup and get a drink of water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
In pioneer times, salt was commonly used for food preservation. It helps to prevent bacteria growth and can extend the lifespan of certain foods. Barrels might have been used for storage, but they are not necessarily associated with food preservation in this context. Checkers is a game and has no relation to food preservation. Baking soda and water might be used for other purposes but are not typically used in food preservation.
When you agree with someone, you are in a state of concordance, meaning you have reached a mutual understanding or agreement with them. Nodding or shaking hands are physical gestures that can signal agreement, but they do not fully capture the concept of concordance. "Asking them did we just become best friends?" and "become closer" are not accurate descriptions of what happens when you simply agree with someone.
The sentence describes the person studying apes and implies that they will be living in a certain condition for months. The word "isolation" makes the most sense in this context, as living in isolation is a common practice for researchers who study animals in the wild. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
In a busy restaurant, customers often raise their hand to get the attention of their waiter or waitress. Waiting in line is typically done when entering a restaurant or when waiting to be seated. Taking a number is typically done at fast-food restaurants or delis where customers have to wait for their order. Paying bills is done at the end of a meal, while ordering dinner is done at the beginning. Therefore, raising his hand is the most likely option for James to do in this situation.
The sentence implies that the person drove their car for a practical reason, which suggests that transportation is the most likely answer. The other options (car crash, death, sleepy, stress) do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not provide a logical explanation for why someone would drive their car.
The sentence suggests that the speaker took a toll road and ended up in a state that they couldn't spell, which indicates that the state's name is likely complex or difficult to spell. Out of the options given, Minnesota is the most complex name to spell. The other states have more straightforward spellings. Additionally, the option "Eastern United States" is not a state and therefore cannot be the correct answer.
The question is asking about a goal that a student would have to improve in, a goal that would most likely be related to their academic performance. The options "kindergarten class," "kitchen," and "library" do not relate to academic performance, while "every aspect of life" is too broad and could apply to anyone, not just a student. Therefore, "class room" is the most appropriate answer choice as it suggests the goal would be to improve academically in a school setting.
The phrase "area of elevation" suggests that the sight being observed is likely a high point or overlook, which may create a feeling of being smaller or diminished in comparison to the vast expanse below. The option "disgust" does not align with the context of the sentence, while "jealous" and "reduction" do not have any clear connection. "Depression" could be a possible choice, but it does not specifically relate to the idea of diminishment in this context.
The question is asking for the best place to make food, which implies that the food is being prepared from scratch rather than being purchased ready-made. The most logical place for this to occur is in a kitchen, which is designed specifically for cooking and food preparation. The other options are unlikely to be the best place to make food - supermarkets are for shopping, tables are for eating, and stomachs are for digesting. While restaurants do have kitchens, they are not necessarily the best place for individuals to make their own food.
The question asks about a place to store extra sheets of paper, which implies a need for storage space. A cabinet is a common piece of office furniture used for storing papers and documents, making it a likely choice for storing extra sheets of paper. The other options do not have the same storage function as a cabinet, with a printer being a device for printing rather than storing, a box and cutting/folding being temporary solutions, and "office" being too broad and not specific enough to answer the question.
The sentence suggests that the woman had difficulty recalling her wedding day, but when she did remember it, she experienced a particular emotion. The details provided do not provide any direct hints as to what that emotion might be, but given the context of a happy wedding day, it is reasonable to assume that the emotion would be positive. The option "pleasure" best fits this assumption, as it suggests a joyous or satisfying feeling. The other options ("hunger," "knowing," "depression," and "knowledge") do not seem to fit the context of the sentence or the general tone of a happy wedding day.
The phrase "long lost" implies that the painting was missing for a significant amount of time, and the fact that Van Gogh "felt" something suggests an emotional response to its discovery. "Great relief" is a common expression used to describe a feeling of release from anxiety or stress, which would make sense if Van Gogh had been searching for the painting for a long time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the emotion it conveys.
The sentence implies that the tomatoes were not thriving, which could be due to a lack of water. Therefore, the logical next step would be to water the garden to try and save the dying plants. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is at a residential location and needs to borrow a common household item such as sugar. The most likely place to find this item would be at a neighbor's house rather than an office, theater, gas station, or wall. Additionally, the use of the word "chuckled" implies that the person knows the neighbor well enough to find the situation somewhat humorous, further supporting the idea that they are borrowing sugar from a nearby neighbor.
The term "body coverings" suggests an item of clothing, which can be found at a clothing store. A phone booth is unlikely to have body coverings, and a workplace or swimming pool may have uniforms or specific clothing requirements, but these would not be referred to as "body coverings." Closets typically contain clothing, but the question is asking where a human can find body coverings, rather than where they might store them.
The sentence suggests that the activity one would like to do with friends is something casual that does not require a specific plan or agenda. "Hang out" is a common phrase used to describe this type of social activity. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "talking about" and "meet for lunch" suggest a specific plan, while "bond with each other" and "side with" do not fit the casual nature of the sentence.
The sentence implies that attraction is not instantaneous, but that it can develop over time. The phrase "grow to do" suggests a gradual process rather than a sudden one. The other options have different connotations that do not necessarily relate to developing attraction over time, such as "flirt" and "kiss."
The question is asking for something that is typically considered beautiful to hear. The word "usually" suggests that there may be exceptions, but in general, the answer will be something that is pleasing to the ears. The option "concert hall" could be a possible answer if the question specified that the context was related to experiencing music live. However, the other options are unlikely to be considered beautiful sounds, with "chainsaw" and "movie" being particularly jarring and unpleasant. "Mouth" could possibly be a correct answer if the context was specified, such as beautiful singing or speaking, but without any additional information it is too broad.
The question is asking for something that can be seen when using television but is not necessary to use television. The only option that fits this criteria is "open eyes," as it is possible to watch television without actively looking at the screen. The other options are all related to the process of using a television, such as plugging it in, finding the remote control, or turning it off (kill).
The sentence suggests that the person is anxious about performing, which is a common symptom of stage fright. Stage fright is a type of performance anxiety specifically related to performing on a stage, in front of an audience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Mosquitoes are known for feeding on the blood of animals and humans, which they collect by puncturing the skin with their mouthparts and sucking up the blood. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence; while the human body contains blood, it does not "collect" it in the way that the sentence suggests. The needle and blood bank may be involved in collecting blood, but they are not alive and therefore cannot be said to "collect" anything. The slaughter house may involve the collection of blood from animals, but this is not the primary purpose of the facility.
The sentence implies that young people are getting lessons, which suggests an educational setting like a classroom. The dictionary is likely nearby to provide support for the students' learning. The other options, like a friend's house or a shelf, do not suggest an educational context. A table could be a possibility, but it is less likely than a classroom or library as a location for formal learning.
The sentence suggests that Susan had a negative personality trait, but despite that, she was capable of displaying a positive one. The choices "mean cruel" and "nice" are both synonyms for each other, and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Friendly" may suggest a different aspect of Susan's personality that is not relevant to the sentence, while "generous" is not necessarily associated with displaying positive behavior towards others. "Kindness" is the best option as it represents a positive personality trait that contrasts with Susan's known negative trait.
The sentence suggests that the bed has been used by many people, which would be typical of a bed found in a hotel room. Mattress stores typically sell new bedding, rest areas do not typically have beds, apartments and lofts would usually have private furnishings, and while a hotel room may also be an apartment or loft, these spaces are not typically used by many people.
The context of the sentence suggests that James lost a return ticket and was unable to get a replacement, which likely means he missed his flight back home. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that James was frustrated and couldn't get a replacement suggests that the ticket was necessary for his return travel, which reinforces the idea that he missed his flight.
The sentence suggests that the opposite of "light" in this context is a word that describes something having a considerable weight. "Crucial" and "darkness" do not relate to weight in any way, and "cumbersome" implies that the object is difficult to handle or move, but not necessarily heavy. Therefore, "heavy" is the most appropriate choice.
The question is asking where to buy an electric fan, which is an appliance commonly found in homes and used to cool down a space. While it's possible to purchase some household items like fans online or in electronics stores, hardware stores are more likely to carry a wide variety of fans designed specifically for home use. Saunas, closets, and computers have no clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence provides a context of wanting to take home a night table, which implies that it is something that can be purchased. The most likely place to buy furniture is a furniture store. The other options do not make sense in the context of purchasing furniture.
The question suggests that we are looking for something that can be placed next to a side chair to create a comfortable place to read and drink coffee. An office or library may have chairs, but they are unlikely to have a table next to them. A building or coffee shop may have tables, but the question specifically asks about something that can be put next to a chair. Therefore, the best answer is table.
The sentence specifies "before gym," which implies that the changing room is for changing into workout clothes. While some of the other options may also have changing rooms, such as a clothing store or department store, these options are not explicitly related to going to the gym. The option "change baby's diaper" is also unlikely as it specifies a specific task rather than a location. "Schools" is a less likely option as well, as students typically change clothes for physical education classes rather than before going to the gym outside of school hours.
The sentence states that Marcy did not want her parents to know that she was sad, so it is logical that she would try to conceal her emotions. The options shed tears, sobs, and talk all involve expressing emotion, which goes against what Marcy is trying to do. Laughing is also too volatile and unpredictable and may draw attention to her behavior. Therefore, the only sensible option left is to smile, which can be seen as a socially acceptable way to interact with others without revealing one's true emotional state.
Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions, and the Sierra Nevada mountains are a well-known mountain range in California. While California is in North America, this answer is not specific enough since marmots can be found in other mountainous regions throughout North America. Similarly, the Great Outdoors is a vague and broad term that could refer to any natural environment. Los Angeles is a city and not known for its wildlife, making it an unlikely choice.
The sentence describes living in a small village outside of a city, which suggests a rural setting. Rural settings are often characterized by open spaces, natural landscapes, and less densely populated areas. The term countryside refers specifically to rural areas outside of urban centers, making it the correct answer option. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they either refer to specific regions or locations within larger geographic areas.
Religious statues are often displayed in places of worship such as churches and cathedrals. These religious institutions typically have a history of commissioning and displaying religious art, including statues. Museums may also display religious art, but they are not typically associated with religious worship. New York City and Central Park do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where many tables are set with silverware rolled into napkins that are nicely presented. This is a common practice in restaurants, where tables are often pre-set with utensils and napkins in an organized and aesthetically pleasing way. The other options (silver, park, table, and cupboard) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "escalators" implies a set of moving stairs commonly found in places such as malls or department stores, where people are transported to different floors or levels. "Motion" and "bringing people up" are too broad and do not specifically relate to escalators, while "vacuum bay" is not relevant to the question.
A post office is a physical location where mail is sorted, processed, and distributed. It is usually located in a building specifically designed for this purpose, which may be in the center of a town or city, in a business district or other area where there is high foot traffic. Deliveries are not typically made from a post office location, so that choice can be eliminated. While a post office may be located in the center of town or city, it could just as easily be located in another part of the area, so those options are not specific enough to be correct.
A flight bag is typically brought to an airport, as it contains items necessary for travel such as passport, boarding pass, and any personal items that are not carried in a larger suitcase. The other options, aircraft, aeroplane, and airplane, refer to the vehicle used for air travel rather than the location where the flight bag is to be brought. "On your lap" is not a suitable answer because it does not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence implies that computers rely on a system of binary digits (or bits) represented by ones and zeroes. This system allows computers to perform complex calculations and execute instructions using a combination of logical operations, which can be referred to as arithmetic. The other options do not accurately capture the complete range of tasks that computers are capable of performing using binary code.
Attending a lecture typically requires active listening and note-taking in order to absorb and retain information. Falling asleep during a lecture would not be a productive use of time, and "learning" is too broad of an answer as it encompasses any method of acquiring knowledge. "Falling asleep" and "falling asleep" are redundant options, and the correct answer "take notes" aligns with best practices for effective learning during a lecture.
The sentence indicates that the person is running away from an assailant, which suggests that his purpose for running is to move quickly and get away from danger. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for why he would be running in this particular situation.
The sentence suggests that the person was searching for something online but could not find it, indicating that what she desired was information. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as food and water, acknowledgment, freedom of information, and freedom of expression are not related to the act of searching for something online.
The sentence suggests that the teenager was struggling to understand the concept of motion and stillness. The word "grasping" implies that the teenager was having difficulty comprehending this idea. The phrase "even if he laid there" suggests that the teenager was lying down and observing the world around him. The word "stillness" directly contrasts with the idea of motion, which makes it the most fitting answer. The other options also relate to the concept of being still, but they do not have the same direct relationship to the contrast between motion and stillness.
The sentence implies that the speaker respects the man's bravery, despite disliking his actions. "Honoring" someone often implies showing respect or admiration for their actions despite differing opinions or beliefs. "Admiring" and "revering" can also denote respect, but "honor" carries a stronger connotation of respect in the face of disagreement. "Loving" and "adoring" do not fit the sentence's context.
The sentence suggests that ferrets are found in the wild before they are captured. "Out of doors" is a phrase commonly used to describe things found outside, particularly in natural environments like forests, fields, and wilderness areas. The other options (hutch, tree house, North America, Rocky Mountains) do not fit the context of the sentence, as hutch and tree house imply captivity, and North America and Rocky Mountains are geographic locations rather than a description of where ferrets are found.
The sentence suggests that sitting down was difficult and unstable, indicating that there was an issue with the stability of the object being sat upon. The reference to "all four" suggests that this object had four legs, and that they were uneven or unstable. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Flatulence, chair and comfort are not related to the physical stability of the object, while the option to "sit on" is redundant with the context of the sentence.
Bathing typically involves using soap or some kind of cleansing agent to remove dirt and sweat from the body. The other options listed (suntan lotion, reading newspaper, slip and fall) are not essential components of bathing, and cleanliness is implied by the act of bathing itself.
State parks often have strict regulations in place to protect natural resources such as trees, wildlife, and water sources. Therefore, trees are more likely to be protected in a state park compared to other options such as a tree store or orchard where trees may be grown for commercial purposes and may not be as strictly regulated. Forests and countryside areas may have some protection, but it is typically not as strict as in a state park.
The sentence implies that the person had to make a call in the middle of the night, which suggests that they were likely in a location where they needed to be quiet. Using a whisper would be the most effective way to communicate without disturbing others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the need for quiet communication.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to improve their current situation or circumstances by achieving something that will make them happier. "Better life" is a commonly used phrase for this purpose. "American dream" is a specific term used to describe the belief that anyone can achieve success and prosperity through hard work and determination, but it does not necessarily refer to a specific action the person is taking. "Complimented" and "headache" are irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and "own house" is too specific to be the correct answer for this general question.
The sentence suggests that the person is going to work with a boss they dislike, which can create a tense and uncomfortable environment leading to stress. Boredom and exhaustion are emotions more commonly associated with a lack of engagement or excitement in a task, while teamwork is a positive collaboration between colleagues. Anger could be a possible emotion, but the sentence doesn't provide enough evidence to support this option.
A contraceptive device is a method or tool used by a person to prevent pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer must refer to an individual or group of individuals who use such devices. The options "pharmacy" and "drug store" may sell contraceptive devices, but they do not use them. The option "bedroom" only refers to a location where a person might use a contraceptive device, not who uses it. The option "men" is too specific and excludes individuals who do not identify as male but still use contraceptive devices. Therefore, the only correct and inclusive option is "person".
The sentence indicates that Bobby wants to move away from the city to a rural area, which implies a desire for open space, fresh air, and a slower pace of life. Among the given options, only countryside fits this description. The other choices are either specific locations (Illinois, South Dakota, Michigan) or a broader but still regionally specific term (Midwest), and do not convey the same sense of place as countryside.
The word "stored" in the sentence implies that the liquid needs to be kept for a period of time, and the phrase "not consumed easily" suggests that it needs to be isolated from the immediate environment to prevent spillage or contamination. A thermos is a container that is specifically designed for keeping liquids at a stable temperature for an extended period of time and typically has a secure lid to prevent spillage. The other options may be suitable for short-term storage, but they do not provide the same level of isolation and temperature control as a thermos.
The sentence suggests that Sam enjoys creating art, which implies that he has a positive attitude towards it. Therefore, it is unlikely that looking at other people's work would depress him or make him feel negative emotions. Instead, it is more likely that looking at other people's art would inspire him to create his own, which is a common experience for artists. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the puppy is now housebroken and can be trusted to sleep indoors. A bed would be the most appropriate place for the puppy to sleep after being housebroken, as it provides a comfortable and secure space within the home. The other options, such as a dog house or kennel, suggest that the puppy would still need to be kept outside or confined to a specific area, which contradicts the fact that it has been housebroken. The options of a table or home are too vague and do not provide any clear guidance on where the puppy should sleep.
The question implies that there is a periodic assessment given at the end of each quarter. The choices "quarterlight" and "hundredweight" are not terms typically associated with education, making them unlikely options. The choice "hour" does not fit the context of the sentence and is not a common term for a school assessment. While there may be a final exam at the end of the school year, the question specifically uses the term "quarter," indicating a shorter period of time. This leaves "semester" as the most reasonable choice, as many schools divide the school year into two semesters, each with two quarters.
The sentence suggests that the person is beginning work that they really want to do, which is likely to elicit a positive emotion. Excitement is a common emotion associated with starting a new job or project that aligns with one's interests and passions. Stress, confusion, and panic are typically negative emotions that would not likely be felt in this scenario.
The question is asking about the negative effect that driving a car has. One of the most well-known negative effects of driving a car is that it contributes to pollution, specifically air pollution from exhaust fumes. The other options are either unrelated to the negative effects of driving a car (delays, on time) or are consequences of poor car maintenance rather than driving itself (car crash, run out of gas).
The sentence suggests that the man had been traveling for a long period of time, which is a common reason for people to stop and take a break at a rest area. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. A show or bowling alley would not typically be located near a road or be associated with travel. The mention of a space shuttle or doctor's office seems out of place and does not match the tone or setting described in the sentence.
The bedroom is typically where a person keeps their closet and dressers, so it's a natural place for them to get dressed and check their appearance in a mirror. The other options, such as a dressing room or hotel room, may also have mirrors available, but they are less common or not as convenient for everyday use. The toilet and house are too general and do not specifically refer to a place where one would typically get dressed or check their appearance.
The sentence implies that the gardener's rosebush was well-known and distributed in many places, including up north. Maine is the only option that is located in the northern region of America, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to find out the arrival time of the bus, and the most logical thing to do in this situation is to consult the station schedule. Therefore, the correct answer is to "read text." The other options do not make sense in this context. "Cross street" and "throw away" are irrelevant and would not help the person find the arrival time. "Enjoy learning" and "play dumb" are also unlikely to be relevant, as the situation described appears to be one where the person is simply trying to find information quickly and efficiently.
The sentence implies that the question is about the actions that precede a bank robbery. It is common for criminals to prepare themselves beforehand by arming themselves, increasing their chances of success and reducing the risk of getting caught. "Step lightly" and "manual" do not make sense in this context, and "serving time" suggests that the criminals have already been caught and convicted, which is not relevant to the question at hand. "Take money" is a possible option, but it is too vague and does not specifically address the preparation aspect of the question.
The sentence implies that the question is about a sailor's feelings towards a particular destination. "Coming home" is a common phrase used to describe returning to one's place of origin, and a sailor who has been away at sea for a long time would likely be excited to return to their home and loved ones. The other options do not make sense in the context of a sailor's emotions towards a particular destination.
The question is open-ended and does not provide any context or limitations. Therefore, any of the choices could be correct as they are all activities that can be done while listening to music. Fiddling, singing, and playing piano are all musical activities that could be done alongside listening to music, while running and having fun are unrelated activities that could also be done while listening to music.
The sentence implies that the turkey needs to be cooked, which means it needs to be heated to a certain temperature. The most common tool to use for cooking is an oven, which uses dry heat to cook food. The other options do not make sense in the context of cooking a turkey. The sink and fridge are used for storage and cleaning, while "bought at store" is not a tool or solution for cooking.
The sentence suggests that the country being referred to is large and spans a landmass, which is a characteristic commonly associated with continents. Continents are the largest land masses on Earth, and they are typically made up of multiple countries. The other options are not as closely related to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that gaining someone's trust involves persuading them to do what you want. This implies that persuasion is an essential component of trust-building. Communication may be necessary for persuasion, but it alone does not guarantee trust. Learning and engagement may contribute to trust, but they are not directly related to persuading someone to do what you want. Friendship may improve trust, but it does not necessarily involve persuasion.
The sentence suggests that the track in question was negative towards the rapper, and the use of slang term "diss" (short for disrespect) reinforces this impression. The other options do not fit with the negative connotation of the sentence. "Belittle" and "contemn" also convey negative attitudes, but they do not specifically relate to a track or musical composition. "Kind" and "being rude" are antonyms and have positive and negative connotations respectively, which do not fit with the context of the sentence.
A mechanic typically has expertise in fixing engines, which often require oil to function properly. Squeaky joints and machine parts may also be part of their job, but these issues are less specific to mechanics than oil engines. The other options, such as machine tool and servicing airplanes, are too specialized and do not reflect the general responsibilities of a mechanic.
The context of the sentence suggests that the two friends have decided to get married and therefore, the correct answer is most likely to be wedding. Weddings are typically associated with lifelong commitments and the formal bond of marriage. The options of restaurant, internet cafe, movie, and friend's house are unlikely to be correct as they do not provide a setting conducive to hosting a wedding ceremony.
The sentence suggests that children do not enjoy going to the opera, as they experience a negative emotion while attending. Boredom is a common feeling associated with attending events that are not engaging or interesting, such as the opera. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that excessive jogging can have negative health consequences for elderly people. Heart attacks are a well-known risk associated with strenuous exercise for people of all ages, but particularly for older individuals who may have preexisting heart conditions. The other answer options are also possible side effects of excessive jogging, but they are not specifically related to the context of the question, which concerns the health risks for the elderly.
The sentence suggests that John does not like new movies and believes they are bad, which implies that he is unlikely to experience any positive emotions such as curiosity, excitement, or wonder when he sees one. Fear and education are also unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is "none of the above."
The other options are all places or situations where ice may be commonly found. A hockey game is played on ice, cold weather may cause ice to form on outdoor surfaces, the polar region of Antarctica is known for its ice formations, and some animals in the zoo may live in environments where ice is present. A refrigerator, on the other hand, is designed to keep things cold but typically does not produce ice unless it has an ice maker or ice tray.
The question is asking where to put sunglasses if you don't have anything to carry them in. Since the question suggests that the sunglasses need to be easily accessible, options like stores along the beach, eye doctor, or drugstore, that require leaving the sunglasses behind, can be eliminated. A bag might be a good option, but it may not be feasible to carry around all the time. A shirt pocket, on the other hand, is a convenient and easily accessible spot to hold sunglasses.
The word "primal" suggests an instinctual behavior, and in the animal kingdom, fighting can be a way to establish dominance and claim territory or resources. While animals may fight for other reasons, such as self-defense or protection of offspring, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on aggression and competition between animals. The other options may also apply to animals, but do not necessarily relate to the idea of proving oneself through physical conflict.
The question mentions a workplace, which suggests a location where people are working indoors rather than outside. The options of alley, motel, and park are unlikely to contain a trash can near liquid in a workplace. The option of water cooler could be a possibility, but it is more likely that a trash can would be located near an area where employees generate trash, such as a desk or breakroom. The most logical option is office.
The sentence implies that creating art gave the speaker a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment, which is commonly associated with achieving a goal or completing a task. A common expression used in this context is "a feeling of accomplishment." The other options may also be associated with creating art, but they do not directly relate to the idea of fulfillment or satisfaction.
The word "rubbish" is often used to refer to waste or trash, so the correct answer is likely to be a place where garbage is disposed of. "Pooja hall" and "park" do not have any relevance to the context of the question, while "television" is not a place where you watch rubbish but a device used to watch TV programs. Therefore, "trash can" or "waste bin" are the most appropriate choices.
The sentence compares a selfish action (not sharing a sandwich with a hungry friend) to an action that indicates the opposite trait. Therefore, the correct answer must be a word that describes someone who would willingly share their sandwich with a friend in need. Options like philanthropic imply a larger scale of giving, while not hungry is not relevant to the context. Unselfish and altruistic are synonyms for the word selfless, which means putting the needs of others before your own. Therefore, selfless is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that the boss gave the person money to make the clients happy, which would likely involve some kind of business-related task. Taking care of proposals is a common responsibility in many industries and involves creating and submitting proposals to potential clients or stakeholders. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When the body gets hot during exercise, it produces sweat. Sweat is the body's way of cooling down by releasing heat from the surface of the skin through evaporation. This means that if someone goes jogging or engages in physical activity, they are likely to sweat, which could then cause their shirt to become soaked. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for why someone's shirt would become soaked during exercise.
Insulation is used to keep a space warm, so the correct answer would be a location that is cold. The options "house," "attic," and "loft" are too general and do not specifically reference a cold environment. "Arctic" and "Antarctica" are both locations known for their extremely cold temperatures, so they are the most likely correct answers.
The sentence implies that there is a specific feature or aspect of the location that the tourist is interested in, which is described as a "column." The other choices (statue, pantheon, roman architecture, whitehouse) may be associated with famous locations, but they do not match the specific detail mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, the sentence highlights that the location is famous for its color, which may suggest that it is a visually striking place, further supporting the idea that the tourist is interested in a particular visual feature (i.e. the column).
The sentence suggests that people are doing something specific in response to the cold weather. Wearing hats is a common practice during cold weather because it helps to retain body heat and prevent heat loss through the head. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Completing a job or killing animals may not be affected by the weather, wearing shorts would be an unexpected activity during cold weather, and believing in God is a personal belief that is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence explicitly states that the business did not make a profit, indicating that it experienced a financial loss. The term "lose money" is commonly used to describe a situation where a business or individual experiences a decrease in their financial resources, and is therefore the most appropriate choice. The other options do not accurately describe a situation where a business did not make a profit.
The word "humorous" refers to the upper arm bone. This bone is a major part of the skeletal system and is found in the arm of mammals, including cows and humans. The other options, such as fresh fish, museum, and comedy club, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Tote bags are commonly used to carry papers and other items for school or work. The other options, such as shopping cart or garage, do not make sense in the context of carrying papers. The closet is a possible option, but it would depend on the situation and what the papers were needed for.
A supply closet is a place where materials and equipment are stored, typically in a workplace or school setting. It is unlikely to be located in a bedroom or a coat closet, as those are typically used for personal belongings. A mop and bucket closet would be a more specific term for a supply closet in a cleaning area. "House" is too general and does not specify a specific room or location.
The use of the word "swinging hinge" suggests that the object being installed is a door. Of the given options, a French door is the most common type of door that is made up of two parts that swing open. A swing door typically only has one part that swings, while a gate is typically used for outdoor entrances and may not be designed with a swinging hinge. Car doors and exterior doors also do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that one person is intentionally causing harm to another person. "Causing pain" is the most direct and accurate answer that fits the context of the sentence. "Seeking revenge" may imply that the person being hurt had previously harmed the other person, which is not mentioned in the sentence. "Hurt feelings" and "sadness" are emotions that may be experienced as a result of being hurt, but do not directly answer the question of what the person is doing. "Relieve" is the opposite of causing pain and does not fit the context of the sentence.
Fencing is a physically demanding sport that requires a lot of physical exertion. When the weather is really hot, it can cause the body to sweat excessively, which can lead to a higher chance of slipping or losing grip on the fencing weapon. Perspiration, therefore, is a potential problem when fencing in hot weather. Puncture wound, drinking, severe injuries, and competition are not related to the context of the question.
The word "cogitate" means to think deeply or carefully about something. If you spend a lot of time cogitating on a topic, you are likely to come to a deeper understanding of it. The other options do not necessarily follow from the meaning of the word "cogitate."
The use of the word "ecosphere" suggests that John was planting trees as part of a larger effort to support the environment. Ficus trees are commonly used in reforestation projects, which aim to restore ecosystems that have been damaged or destroyed by human activity. The other options, such as "sunny window" or "pots", do not have any clear connection to the idea of environmental restoration.
Red phone booths are a well-known symbol of England, so this choice is likely the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The phrase "living less expensively" also does not seem relevant to the question.
The sentence implies that there is a location that is well-known for having numerous lakes. Michigan is a state in the United States with a nickname of "The Great Lakes State" because it is surrounded by the Great Lakes, which are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The other options do not necessarily have a significant association with lakes.
The amount of storage needed, 500 tons, suggests that James requires a large space to accommodate these items. A warehouse would be the most suitable option as it is specifically designed for storing large amounts of goods. The other options, such as an attic or garage, would be too small to store such a large quantity of items, while Michigan does not provide any insight into the type of facility needed.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is one where people frequently eat popcorn and drink soda while seated. This is a common practice in movie theaters, where concession stands offer these snacks to movie-goers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is just waking up and heading to work. In order to go to work, they would need to get dressed first. The other options are not applicable or necessary for heading to work, such as concentrating or having a job. Drinking coffee may be a personal preference, but it is not necessary for going to work.
Marmots are typically found in parklands and mountainous areas, which are often characterized by dense forests and rocky terrain. Vancouver Island is a location where marmots can be found, but it is not a type of habitat. The terms "jungle" and "North America" are not relevant to the habitat of marmots, as they are not typically found in dense tropical forests or across the entire North American continent. The option "northern hemisphere" is too broad, as marmots are only located in specific regions of the hemisphere.
The sentence suggests that while terrorism may be caused by a few individuals, it can have far-reaching consequences. The use of the phrase "all out" implies that the consequences are significant and widespread, beyond just the immediate effects of terrorism such as detonating bombs. Of the options given, war is the most logical choice as it involves large-scale conflicts and is often a result of terrorism that is not effectively addressed or resolved. The other options do not fully capture the breadth and severity of the consequences suggested by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the wristwatch is valuable and needs to be stored safely. The options "jewelry box", "dresser" and "hock" do not provide enough protection for an expensive wristwatch. "Jewelry store" is not a likely option for someone to keep their own wristwatch, as it is typically a retail store. "Case" is the most appropriate choice, as it is a secure and protective storage option for a valuable item like a wristwatch.
In this question, the phrase "main part of turkey" refers to a geographical location, which narrows down the possible answers to the ones that refer to geography rather than animals or bodies of water. The term "middle east" could be a possible answer, as Turkey is located in the region commonly referred to as the Middle East, but the more specific and accurate answer is "asia minor." Asia Minor is the peninsula on which Turkey is situated, and it is a commonly used term to describe this region. The Balkan Peninsula is not related to Turkey, and "turkeycock" is a non-existent word that does not make any sense in the context of the question.
The question asks what someone might be starting a fire to achieve, indicating that the person has a purpose for starting the fire. The option "warmth" is the most logical choice as starting a fire can provide warmth and is a common reason for starting fires in camping, outdoor activities or even in homes during the winter season. The options "burns", "going to jail", and "haircut" do not have a clear connection to starting a fire. Also, "going to jail" is repeated in the options which indicates that it is most likely not the correct answer.
Central banks typically use monetary policy tools, such as raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, to combat inflation. One common consequence of such policies is a slowdown in economic activity, known as a recession. Stealing and spending more are not methods used by central banks, and deflation and problems are potential consequences or symptoms of inflation, rather than methods to combat it.
When living beings die, their breathing usually stops first. This happens because breathing is controlled by the respiratory system, which depends on the heart to pump oxygen-rich blood to the lungs. When the heart stops beating, there is no more oxygen to fuel the respiratory system, and breathing stops. The other options are not necessarily true for all cases of dying, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Samantha prefers to spend her time with something other than people, and the option "animal" is the only choice that is not related to people. The other options ("headache," "many people," "put together," and "own house") all relate to people, objects, or concepts that are directly or indirectly associated with people. Additionally, the notion that Samantha is uncomfortable around others further supports the idea that she would prefer the company of something other than people, like an animal.
The sentence suggests that the man needs to complete paperwork, which is typically done in an office setting. The other options do not necessarily provide a suitable location for completing work-related tasks, such as paperwork. "Desk" may be too specific, "work" is too general, "downtown" is unrelated to the task at hand, and "meeting" suggests a different purpose than completing paperwork.
Pubs are a type of establishment known for serving alcoholic beverages and providing a social gathering place. Ireland is well-known for its pub culture, with traditional pubs being an important part of Irish society and often serving as community centers. Great Britain and England may also have pubs, but they are not as strongly associated with this type of establishment as Ireland is. Bahrain and London do not have a particular connection to pubs.
The question mentions "blue ridge mountains" and specifically says they are called "Blue Mountain." Virginia is home to the Blue Ridge Mountains, and there is a peak called "Blue Mountain" located in Virginia as well. The other options do not have a clear connection to the Blue Ridge Mountains or the name "Blue Mountain."
Fishing is an activity usually done in outdoor bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. State parks often have bodies of water that are stocked with fish and open for fishing to visitors. Confession, concert, carnival, and apartment have no clear association with fishing or outdoor activities.
The question is asking about the class or group of people that a king or queen belongs to. Monarchy refers to a form of government in which a country is ruled by a single person, usually a king or queen, who holds absolute power over the people. This means that the monarch is considered to be above the rest of society, and belongs to a distinct social class. The other options have no connection to the concept of monarchy.
The sentence suggests that the sinner is seeking forgiveness from a deity, which can be achieved through a process called absolution. Absolution is the act of being pardoned or forgiven for one's sins, usually through a religious rite or sacrament. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "outhouse" typically refers to an outdoor toilet, which was a common feature in older homes or in areas without access to modern plumbing systems. Therefore, the opposite of not having an outhouse would be having indoor plumbing, which is a more modern and convenient method of disposing of waste. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the breathing makes noise but does not indicate that the person is sick. A sigh is a deep and audible exhale often used to indicate tiredness, disappointment, or relief, but it is not a symptom of illness. The other options, such as coughing or clavicular breathing (breathing with the upper chest only), are associated with respiratory problems or health issues, making them incorrect choices. Yawning is a normal reflex that can be noisy, but it is not associated with sickness or health problems. "Live" is not a type of breathing.
The sentence suggests that people enjoy competing because it allows them to showcase their abilities or talents in some area. This is closely related to the concept of skill, which is a measure of a person's proficiency or competence in a certain activity. The other options do not seem as relevant to the context of the sentence, as sportsmanship, opponent, and effort are more about the behavior or attitudes associated with competition, while competition itself is a broader concept that encompasses many types of activities.
The sentence implies that visiting museums of old dinosaur bones has a positive impact on children. The word "amazement" suggests that the children are in awe of the exhibits and find them interesting, while the phrase "being bored" suggests the opposite. The word "crowding" does not make sense in this context, and "retrospection" is not related to the theme of the sentence. Therefore, the best answer is "excited".
The comparison to a shark implies that the salesperson is actively seeking out potential customers to sell to, much like a shark searches for prey. The other options, such as a bookstore or toy store, may have customers, but they are not specific to the context of the sentence as the term "prey" suggests a hunting or aggressive behavior towards customers.
The term "gentleman" is often associated with professionalism, formality, and class, which makes "suit" a likely choice as a gentleman's attire. A suit is a commonly accepted formal outfit that suggests sophistication and maturity, which are key attributes commonly associated with a gentleman. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the location being referred to is typically used for storage of tools, which is often associated with a garage. A repair shop may also be a possible location for tools, but this would be a more specialized setting, and there is no contextual reference to suggest that this is the case. A drawer is too small a space and the neighbor's house and dentist have no connection to the idea of storing tools.
The mention of the Big Twelve conference suggests a connection to college athletics. The only option among the choices that is a state is Oklahoma, which is home to the University of Oklahoma, whose athletic teams are known as the Sooners and play in the Big Twelve conference. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that after the yoga class, everyone was instructed to sit quietly. Meditation is a common practice in yoga and is often done as a way to relax and calm the mind. Therefore, it makes sense that the correct answer is "meditate." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "sit down" and "alone" are too vague, "shut up" is inappropriate and rude, and "go home" does not indicate any further instructions or actions.
The phrase "kept a straight face" implies that the person did not display any emotions on their face. This suggests that they were purposely avoiding showing any emotion. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the ranch house is a common type of architecture in a particular state located in the northwestern Rocky Mountains. Montana is a state known for its vast expanses of open land, cattle ranches, and rural communities, making it a likely candidate for the answer. British Columbia is a province in Canada and is not located in the United States. California is located on the West Coast but does not fall within the northwestern Rocky Mountains. The term "desert" does not provide enough context to make an informed choice.
The sentence suggests that the boss disapproves of the employees chatting with their friends during work hours. However, the boss seems to be okay with the employees doing something else. The phrase "exchanging information" suggests that the boss is okay with the employees discussing work-related topics or exchanging information that would help them in their jobs. The other options, such as happiness, laughter, communication, and social approval, do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the student attended a lecture after pulling an all-nighter. The most likely reason for the student to pull an all-nighter would be to study, prepare for the lecture, and gain knowledge beforehand. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a musical ensemble that includes four instruments, one of which is a viola. A string quartet only includes two violins, a viola, and a cello, so it does not match the question's requirements. A symphony and an orchestra both include many different instruments, so it is impossible to know whether a viola will be present or not. A viola case is not a musical ensemble. A string quintet, on the other hand, includes two violins, a viola, a cello, and an additional instrument, which could be another viola or a double bass. Therefore, a string quintet is the correct answer.
The other options do not make sense in the context of obtaining a ladder. An apple orchard and backyard would not have ladders readily available for purchase or loan. A garage may have a ladder, but it's not a given, and it's not a place to go to specifically obtain a ladder. A roof is a dangerous place to climb without proper equipment and training, and it's not a place to go to obtain a ladder. A hardware store, on the other hand, is a common place to purchase or rent ladders for home projects.
The use of the word "likely" implies that there is a common or expected behavior. While it's possible to see someone pushing a religious tract in any of the listed locations, the most common place would be in a public place such as a park or busy street corner where there are a lot of people. Pushing religious tracts in places like airports or churches may be seen as more targeted or intentional, while pushing them in a laundromat or on a stage may not be as effective in reaching a large audience.
A sideboard is a piece of furniture that is commonly used to store and display serving dishes, particularly in dining rooms. The other options, such as kitchen or bathroom, are unlikely places where one would find a sideboard filled with serving dishes. The context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on a specific area of the home where meals are served, which points to the dining room as the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that studying for final exams is a stressful experience, and specifically mentions being afraid of something. The context implies that the fear is related to the outcome of the exams, which suggests that the correct answer is failure. This is further supported by the fact that success and graduation are presented as positive outcomes, which would not cause fear. Anxiety and studying are not outcomes but rather aspects of the studying experience itself, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a location where a steakhouse can be found with an ocean view. Mexico has many coastal cities and is known for its steak and seafood. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence is asking for something parents commonly tell their kids in order to get them to go to sleep. The phrase "stop talking" is often used in this context, as chatty children may stay up later than they should if they are allowed to continue talking. The other options, while related to sleeping or bedtime, do not specifically address the issue of talking which is commonly associated with bedtime.
The word "protect" suggests that the guard is there to prevent harm or danger. The options "unprotected" and "getting lost" do not imply a specific threat to be protected from. The options "inmate" and "prisoner" suggest that the guard is already in a place where dangerous individuals are being held, but does not necessarily indicate that the guard is protecting the person being asked. The option "attack" is the most likely answer, as it suggests that the guard is there to prevent physical harm from occurring.
The sentence implies that the person needs to purchase more beer, which suggests that they would need to go to a store to buy it. The options "casino," "fridge," and "refrigerator" are not plausible choices for purchasing beer, as they are not typically associated with selling alcohol. "Bottle" is a vague option, as it is not clear where the bottle would be purchased from. "Grocery store" is the most reasonable choice, as beer is commonly sold in grocery stores.
The phrase "returns to work" implies that the person was not previously working, and the choice "earn money" makes the most sense as a reason for them to return to work. The other options ("key", "get out of bed", "need money", "understand themselves") are either irrelevant or not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that there is a positive outcome associated with answering questions correctly. One common outcome of answering questions correctly is an improvement in one's grade or overall academic performance. The other options, such as embarrassment or failure, are negative outcomes that are not typically associated with successfully answering questions in an academic setting. Additionally, the option "children will learn" is not a specific outcome related to the individual answering the questions, but rather a goal or result more broadly associated with the process of education. Finally, "discussion" may be a positive outcome of answering questions, but it does not directly address the question of what answering questions correctly leads to.
The sentence is comparing the lifespan of indoor cats versus outdoor cats. It is a known fact that outdoor cats have a shorter lifespan than indoor cats due to various factors such as exposure to danger and diseases. The phrase "tend to" suggests that this is a general trend rather than an absolute fact. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that despite the couple's regular sexual activity, they lack a sense of familiarity or connection with each other. "Rapport" refers to the ability to communicate and connect with someone, indicating that the couple's lack of rapport may be contributing to their superficial relationship. The other options do not appear to be relevant to the sentence's context.
The sentence suggests that someone is drinking alcohol in public and getting drunk, which is a common activity at bars. Bars are establishments where people go to consume alcoholic beverages, whereas the other options (jail, gutter, city hall, park) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the grain of sand is causing discomfort to the person wearing something. A grain of sand getting into a bucket, sand pile, or beach wouldn't have a noticeable impact. A clam may cause discomfort if it bites someone, but this isn't mentioned in the sentence. The only logical option is a bathing suit, as a grain of sand getting into a bathing suit may cause irritation or itching.
The sentence suggests that the people in ancient times were interested in charting each star, which implies a fascination with the nighttime sky. The other options do not have any obvious relevance to the context of the sentence. Staring into the heavens or sky is a common expression for looking up at the stars or celestial bodies, which reinforces the idea that the correct answer is "heavens."
The sentence suggests that the person traveled to a destination known as the "big apple" which is commonly used to refer to New York City. The fact that they hit a "toll road or two" suggests that they were driving on highways, which further narrows down the location to the eastern United States where toll roads are common. The other options, such as France or Massachusetts, are not specific enough to match the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that John is unable to find any legal alternatives for the item he's searching for, and his inability to travel out of the country exacerbates the illegal nature of the item he's seeking. This suggests that John will have to obtain the item through illegal means, which is often associated with the black market. The other options, such as rules or underage, do not offer a viable solution for obtaining the item. The white market refers to legal transactions, while banned simply refers to the fact that the item is prohibited.
The question implies that the person praying is experiencing troubles and needs help. Out of the options given, asking for help is the most appropriate action to take when in need. Talking to God and looking upward are both common actions during prayer, but they do not necessarily address the person's specific troubles. Clapping and kneeling down may be personal preferences but are not essential for effective prayer.
The sentence suggests that the person has just bought some food and needs cold storage for it. The most common type of cold storage for personal use is a household freezer, which is designed to keep food frozen for extended periods of time. The other options, such as a laboratory or restaurant, do not make sense in the context of storing food bought for personal use. The grocery store is also not a viable option as the person has already bought the food and needs to store it at home.
The correct answer should be a verb that suggests expressing gratitude or appreciation for someone's help. "Say thank" is the only option that fits this description, while the other options do not convey a clear message of thanking someone. "Satisfaction" and "smile at" are not actions that show appreciation, while "will thank" and "say compliment" are uncertain and unclear in their meaning.
Glue is a commonly used item in offices, homes, and schools, and is often stored in a container that is easily accessible when needed. A desk drawer is a logical place to store glue in an office or classroom setting, and is likely the most common option among the choices given. A closed container or barrel would not be practical for accessing glue quickly, while "school" and "classroom" are not specific enough and could refer to a variety of locations within those settings.
The sentence implies that the hose is likely stored in a place where gardening tools and equipment are kept. A balcony, greenhouse, and garage are not typically used for storing gardening supplies, and a hardware store is a place to purchase items rather than store them. Therefore, the most likely answer is the garden shed.
The word "panic" suggests a situation where people are experiencing intense fear or anxiety. When people panic, they often act without thinking and may behave in unpredictable and violent ways. "Run amok" means to behave uncontrollably and violently, which is a common reaction in a panicked crowd. The other options do not accurately reflect the behavior of people in a state of panic.
The question is asking about the end result of someone committing a murder. Murder is the act of intentionally killing another person, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the victim will be dead. The other options may describe the process or effects of the murder, but they do not accurately answer the question of what happens to the victim.
The sentence suggests that water alone was not sufficient for the man to clean his clothes. This implies he needed another substance to help him get the dirt out. Soap is a common cleaning agent that is often used along with water to wash clothes. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence (gather up, get dirty, washcloth) or are already mentioned in the sentence (use water).
The sentence indicates that the potatoes are going to be served, so the correct answer would be a vessel that is commonly used for serving food. Among the options provided, "plate" is the most appropriate vessel for serving potatoes. "Fried" and "French fries" are methods of preparing the potatoes, while "countryside" and "restaurant" are not vessels.
The sentence indicates that Sean enjoys analyzing information, which suggests that he is interested in uncovering or discovering some underlying truth or meaning. The other options, such as "enlightened" or "learn more about," do not necessarily imply a search for truth or meaning, but could represent a more general interest in acquiring knowledge or expanding one's understanding. The word "facts" is also not specific enough to capture the idea of discovering truth, as facts can be objective and neutral without necessarily revealing a deeper truth.
The sentence suggests that a presentation may be set up on a table, which implies that it may be related to showcasing physical items. A furniture store typically displays furniture on tables or in showrooms, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not offer as clear a connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the students needed new sports equipment, which implies that they are involved in some sort of athletic activity. The logical place for them to use this equipment would be at their school. The other options, such as the mall or Sears, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person fell while going for a run, which typically happens when a person trips or loses their balance. Sweating, satisfaction, working out, and better health are not directly related to falling while running.
The sentence suggests that reading letters produces something negative when someone is unaware of a condition. The word "strain" implies that reading may be difficult or uncomfortable. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. Laughter, realization, enlightenment, and happiness are all positive experiences that would not typically result from difficulty reading.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is going overseas, which typically requires a passport. Shouting at, feeling happy, or crossing the street do not have any clear connection to overseas travel. Boarding a ship might be a possible action if the person is traveling by sea, but getting a passport is a necessary step regardless of the mode of transportation.
The sentence states that the person enjoys being able to answer anything, which implies that they enjoy learning and acquiring knowledge. The phrase "loved studying" further reinforces this idea that the person is interested in gaining more knowledge. The options "better grades," "higher intelligence," "inspiration," and "strain eyes" do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide any logical connection to the idea of being a trivia hound who loves learning.
The sentence suggests that people from all countries enjoyed the music, indicating that the music had a wide appeal and could be enjoyed by people from different cultural backgrounds. The word "universal" describes something that is applicable or relatable to everyone, regardless of their background, and would therefore be the most appropriate choice. The other options describe specific qualities of the music, but do not necessarily indicate that the music was universally enjoyed.
The sentence mentions that John tried to gain money, but his attempts to improve himself only had a negative effect on his income. This suggests that John's income decreased or was reduced as a result of his efforts. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence (e.g. "lose weight" is irrelevant to the topic of money and income).
Mexican cuisine is often associated with regions like Texas and Southern California due to their proximity to Mexico and large Hispanic populations. Texas, in particular, is known for its Tex-Mex cuisine, which blends elements of Mexican and American cuisine. San Diego is also known for its Mexican food, but it is a more localized answer compared to the broader regions of Texas and Southern California. Mexico and Mexica are incorrect answers as they are not US states.
The sentence implies that there is a location where pillows are not typically found. Home and bedroom are locations where pillows are common, and "make seat softer" and "go to bed" are not locations. Rest area is a location where pillows are not usually provided, making it the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the fire has caused significant damage and has continued for at least a week, leading the governor to declare it as the "biggest" he had seen. The word "disaster" fits the context as it suggests a widespread and severe event, which is likely to be the case with a wildfire raging for two weeks. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity of the situation.
The context of the sentence suggests that the tourists are seeking out a specific cultural icon that is commonly associated with England - the red telephone box. London is the capital of England, so it may seem like a viable option, but it is too specific and not necessarily relevant to the idea of seeking out red telephone boxes in general. The other options, such as calling mom or going to a restaurant or bank, have no connection to the idea of seeking out a specific cultural icon.
The instruction to keep the gel container cool suggests that it needs to be stored in a temperature-controlled environment. The most common temperature-controlled place in most households is a refrigerator, which is designed to keep food and other items at a cool temperature to prevent spoilage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and none of them are designed to keep things cool.
The sentence mentions that James used the oven to cook the meat, which implies that he was using a dry heat method. Roasting is a dry heat cooking method that typically involves cooking meat in an oven, and is often used for larger cuts of meat like roasts. Burning would result in an overcooked or even charred meat, while baking would typically involve using a batter or dough. The options of ocean and cool temperature are not applicable to cooking meat in an oven.
The sentence suggests that to be able to chat with friends, someone needs to have the ability to interact socially with others. This could include skills such as being able to initiate and maintain conversations, read social cues, and adapt to the social context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Tertiary education typically refers to college or university education, which is pursued after completing high school. Therefore, the logical answer would be to "graduate from high school" before entering tertiary education. The other options (catch cold, feel lonely, enter college, finish junior high) are irrelevant to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that a party involves socializing or enjoyment, so dressing oneself and drinking beer are more appropriate activities than driving a train or grumbling. The choice of dressing oneself depends on whether the person in question is a male or female.
The sentence suggests that going to the market on a weekend has something to do with obtaining a certain type of item or experience that can be counted on. The option "food" is the most likely correct answer, as markets are often associated with purchasing fresh fruits, vegetables, and other types of food items. The other options are less likely to be correct, as they either do not fit with the context of the sentence or are too general to be a specific reference to what can be counted on when going to the market on a weekend (e.g. "see other people").
The sentence suggests that the individuals are making an important decision and want to ensure that they have all the information they need to make a informed choice. The option "careful" is the most logical choice, as it implies a thoughtful and cautious approach. The other options, such as "save money" and "make money," do not necessarily relate to the decision-making process and may not align with the individuals' goals. "Down payment" is a specific term related to financial transactions, but it does not encompass the broader context of the sentence. "Rush" also does not make sense in this context, as it implies the individuals are in a hurry to make a decision.
The question suggests that the person wants to go to a place where they will be treated with respect and possibly even like royalty. While some of the other options may offer a level of respect or formality, a restaurant is most commonly associated with providing a high level of service and hospitality to its customers, including treating them with courtesy and respect. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Lizards are reptiles commonly found in dry, hot climates such as deserts. Utah is known for having a desert climate, which makes it a likely location to find lizards in the wild. The other options, such as a garden or the zoo, are not necessarily places where lizards would be found naturally. South Carolina and Bermuda also do not have a climate or environment that is particularly known for the presence of lizards in the wild.
The sentence suggests that attempting too much learning can have negative consequences, and specifically mentions headaches as a potential outcome. While education, growth, and knowing more may be positive outcomes of learning, they are not mentioned as potential negative consequences in this sentence. Intelligence is also not necessarily related to attempting too much learning, as intelligence is a complex trait that cannot be solely attributed to the amount of learning one has done.
The sentence suggests that if someone were to lay on the floor of their outdoor deck and look up, they would be looking at something above them. The only option that fits this description is the sky, which is commonly visible above outdoor decks. The other options, such as understanding themselves or looking at a wall or carpet, do not make sense in this context.
The use of the word "cushy" in the sentence suggests that sitting in the chair will be comfortable. Additionally, the other options are not necessarily associated with sitting in a chair, such as falling asleep or flatulence. "Laziness" may be a possibility but is not directly related to sitting in a chair.
The word "require" suggests that this is a necessary component in the construction of houses. A foundation is a crucial component of any building, as it provides stability and support. The other options do not make sense in this context - "very large" and "pornography" are not relevant to the construction of houses, "walls" are built on the foundation, not the other way around, and "hole" is too vague and does not suggest any kind of construction.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where one can control their own electricity. This is commonly found in homes and buildings, which typically have a basement where the electrical panel or master control is located. The other options do not make sense in this context; a big factory, helm of ship, or main office would likely have a more complex electrical system that would require a different type of control, while "center" is too vague without additional information.
The sentence suggests that the senator was making excuses for someone's potentially violent behavior and trying to blame media (video games and television) for it. The correct answer must be a word that completes the sentence in a logical and appropriate way, given the context. "Kill" is the only option that makes sense in this context – the senator is trying to excuse violence, which is often associated with killing, and is suggesting that media cannot make someone violent enough to kill. The other options (such as "plug in" or "switch on") do not fit the context or make sense logically in this sentence.
The sentence indicates that the frozen food is starting to melt, which suggests that it needs to be kept at a lower temperature to prevent spoilage. The most likely option is the refrigerator or fridge, which is designed to keep food at a cool temperature. The other options, such as a supermarket or grocery store, do not provide sufficient cooling to prevent the food from spoiling. Additionally, a heater would only make the problem worse, as it would cause the food to melt even faster.
A drill is a commonly used tool for DIY projects and repairs, and is often stored in a place that is easily accessible. While it's possible for some people to store their drill in a basement or repair shop, these locations are less likely as they are not as convenient as a garage which is often located near the entrance of the house or apartment. Additionally, storing a drill in a bathroom or dentist office does not make sense as these places are not typically associated with home improvement or repairs.
The question is asking about winning a game, which implies a competitive situation where there are winners and losers. Therefore, competitiveness is the most appropriate choice. Satisfaction and learning may be outcomes of playing a game, but they do not guarantee winning. Injuries are a possible risk of playing a game, but not a necessary requirement for winning. Play is a generic term that does not provide any specific information about winning a game.
The sentence suggests that the location of the gazelle can be found in a zoo that is reminiscent of Disneyland. Since the question also specifies that the location is in an eastern continent, we can eliminate Australia and Ivory Coast as potential options. Wildlife refuge and open plain are not specific enough locations to suggest where this Disneyland-like zoo may be located. This leaves us with Asia as the correct answer, as it is a large continent known for its diverse range of animal habitats and also home to popular theme parks such as Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.
A stable is a common place for domesticated animals such as cows to live, as it provides shelter and a safe space for them. The other options, such as a zoo, story book, or toy store are not realistic or practical places for a cow to live. The great outdoors may be an option for some cows, but generally, they require a certain level of care and protection that they would not receive in the wild.
The word "spiteful" suggests that the child did something negative, possibly in retaliation or with a desire to cause harm. The phrase "acting out" is often used to describe behavior that is disruptive, defiant, or attention-seeking, which would fit with this context. The other options do not involve negative behavior, nor do they directly relate to the idea of being spiteful towards parents.
The sentence suggests that being in a hot weather can cause discomfort, and going into an air conditioned room can provide some form of relief from the heat. Out of the given choices, only relief makes sense in the context of finding a solution to the discomfort caused by hot weather. The other options either do not relate to the situation or are not effective ways of finding relief from hot weather.
Gazelles are known to inhabit open grassy plains and savannas, so the correct answer would be "open plain." "Encyclopedia" and "breakfast" are unrelated to the context of the question, while "Ivory Coast" is a specific area in Africa that may or may not have gazelles. "Asia" is a large continent and it is unclear if gazelles inhabit any areas within it.
The use of "did not want to know" suggests that the truth discovered is likely to be unpleasant or difficult to accept. This could lead to emotional pain, such as feeling betrayed or hurt. The other options, such as relief or understanding, do not align with the negative connotations of the question. Grey hair and enlightenment are not necessarily related to the emotional consequences of discovering an unwanted truth.
The sentence suggests that the principal was giving a speech, which is commonly associated with school settings. The other options do not make sense in the context of a principal giving a speech, such as a sporting event or concert hall.
The sentence describes a bird flying and then landing on a branch, which suggests that the answer is related to some characteristic of the bird's anatomy. The options "having for pet" and "falling down" are not related to the sentence and can be eliminated. The sentence mentions that the bird flew, which indicates that the bird has wings. Therefore, the correct answer must be "feathers," which are a distinctive feature of birds that facilitate flight. Finally, the option "two legs" is not relevant because the bird's legs are not mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence mentions a recreation area run by the local government, which suggests a public park or similar space. The term "state park" specifically refers to a protected area of land managed by a government entity, often for recreational use. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Summer is followed by the season of fall, so it is the correct answer. "Stand", "nice", and "cold" have no clear relationship to the question. While "winter" does come after fall, it is not the immediate next season in the sequence.
The sentence suggests that the task at hand involves attaching two pieces of paper together. The options "pantry," "office," and "desk drawer" are not relevant to the task and do not provide a solution. "Stick" may refer to a glue stick, which the sentence indicates the speaker does not want to use. A stapler is a common tool for attaching paper together without the use of glue.
The sentence suggests that women have a specific goal or desire related to their reproductive capabilities. "Having children" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly addresses the topic of procreation. "Population increase" is too general and doesn't take into account the personal motivations of individual women. "Pregnancy" is related to the process of having children but doesn't necessarily imply an expectation or goal. "Feeling good" and "train" are completely unrelated and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the parent has baked some cookies, which would typically be consumed or eaten after they are baked. The other options do not make sense in this context - there is no indication that the parent is experiencing fear or homeschooling, and the options to box gift for the child or close the box aren't relevant as it is not mentioned that a box is present or what it contains.
Australia is commonly referred to as both a country and a continent. It is the only country that is also considered a continent due to its size and distinct landmass. The other options do not accurately describe Australia.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is intentionally killing others, which is commonly referred to as murder. The other options are not accurate descriptions of a person who commits murder. "Terrible" is too vague and could apply to a wide range of behaviors, "going to jail" and "get arrested" are consequences of the behavior rather than descriptions of the person, and "hunter" is a completely different activity that involves killing animals rather than people.
The sentence suggests that the runner's bad shoelaces caused him to lose the race, which implies that they may have caused him to stumble or trip. This makes "trip over" the most likely answer. The other options (e.g. gain ground, win the race) are unlikely given that the sentence clearly states that the runner lost, and it is not clear how bad shoelaces would help the runner near the finish line. The option "get tired" is also unlikely, as the sentence does not suggest that the runner was physically exhausted, but rather that his shoelaces were the issue.
A platform is often used in a concert hall for a performer to stand on while playing an instrument, such as a violin. A train, museum, arena, or building would not typically have a platform designated for a violinist to perform on.
Art galleries can be found in a variety of locations, including cities both large and small, downtown areas, and the middle of town. While cities like London and Frankfurt may be well-known for their art scenes and have a higher concentration of galleries, it is still possible to find galleries in other locations as well. Ultimately, the correct answer will depend on the context of the question and any additional information provided.
The sentence implies that whatever you do, it requires effort and something else. "Make progress" and "make peace" do not necessarily require effort, whereas "make war" has a negative connotation that doesn't fit the context. "Kindness" is not connected to the idea of making an effort. "Take time" fits well as an option since many things in life require both effort and time to accomplish, such as learning a new skill or completing a project.
The phrase "head out to shop" suggests that the person is going to a store to purchase something. The options "loft," "house," and "kitchen" are not stores, so they cannot be the correct answer. The option "bundle" does not make sense in the context of remodeling or shopping for flooring. "Home Depot" is a well-known home improvement store that commonly sells flooring and other remodeling supplies, making it the most likely option.
The description of Billy stumbling about in a dark place and a rolled up map of stars suggest that he is likely in an attic, where people often store items that are not used frequently, such as the map of stars. The creaky floor also points to the possibility of being in an attic, as the wood is often old and may make noise when someone walks on it. The other options are not related to the context and do not make sense with the description provided.
Lemurs are diurnal animals, meaning they are active during the day and asleep at night. Therefore, it is likely that they rely on sunshine to see, as it provides the necessary light for them to navigate their surroundings. The moon and rain forest would not necessarily provide enough light for a lemur to see clearly. A dictionary has no connection to a lemur's ability to see, and wilderness is too broad of an option to be specific to this question.
The sentence suggests that eating, drinking, and breathing are all necessary for sustaining life. Breathing is specifically mentioned as a "key factor," which indicates that it is an essential part of living. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "cried" suggests a strong emotional response, and the phrase "when seeing the bill" implies that the emotion was triggered by something related to money. The word "distraught" means extremely upset or overwhelmed by emotions, so this would be the most fitting choice. "Wipe eyes" and "shed tears" are more specific actions that don't capture the intensity of the emotion, while "miserable" and "sad" are too general and don't convey the specific feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions.
The question is asking about a location where someone can put new carpeting. The most likely options are places where people live or work, such as homes or offices. The other choices, like gym, cub, istanbul, or roon, are not relevant to the context of the question and do not provide any clues to help identify the correct answer.
The verb "slither" typically implies a movement that is low to the ground and somewhat stealthy, suggesting that the snake is likely to emerge from a location that provides some cover or concealment. The option "underbrush" refers to dense vegetation close to the ground, which would provide an ideal location for a snake to hide before slithering out. The other options may not provide suitable hiding places for a snake or may not be as common habitats for snakes.
The sentence indicates that Lance enjoyed playing simulations on his computer, which suggests that he may have been building a virtual world. While all of the options are possible to build in a simulation, a large city is a common choice for simulation games where players can create and manage their own virtual metropolis. The other options, such as a university, MIT, or a post office, are less likely to be the focus of a simulation game. The option "paper" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The word "disappointed" suggests that the people were expecting something to happen, but it did not meet their expectations. The phrase "aren't entitled to" implies that they did not have a right to expect it. Therefore, the best option is to "lower expectations" in order to avoid disappointment in the future. The other options, such as "like ice cream" or "dance well," are not related to the context of the sentence and do not offer a solution to the problem mentioned.
The sentence suggests that the curious child released a balloon to see where it would go, and the only choice that makes sense in this context is "sky." It is common for balloons to float upwards when released, and the sky is the most logical destination for the balloon in this scenario. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "most people" suggests a general location where carrots can be commonly found, indicating that it is likely a place where a large number of people have access to them. While carrots can be found in salads and fields, these options are too specific and do not represent the most common place where people get their carrots. The other options, such as cellar or store, do not have as strong a connection to the context of the sentence as the option "supermarket," which is a common and easily accessible location for purchasing produce.
The sentence suggests that the curious child is looking for information about a lizard and therefore opens up a book with a lot of information. The most likely option is an encyclopedia, which is defined as a comprehensive reference work containing information on all branches of knowledge. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and therefore can be eliminated as incorrect.
The sentence suggests that Johnny's work requires the use of a hammer, which is a common tool in repair shops. Repair shops are places where people can bring broken objects to be fixed, and typically require a variety of tools to complete repairs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not necessarily require the use of a hammer.
The sentence suggests that soldiers who have been killing people during something may experience a certain emotion when they return home. The only choice that relates to emotions is "feel remorse," which means to feel regret and sadness for past actions. The other choices all relate to negative consequences or actions that may occur after returning home, but do not directly address the emotions that soldiers may experience.
The word "rook" has multiple meanings, but in the context of explaining its name, it is likely referring to the chess piece. The chess piece "rook" is named after the tower on a medieval castle, which the piece can move in a straight line resembling the tower's vertical movement. Therefore, the correct answer is "castle." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of explaining the name of a rook.
The sentence implies that the old lady is hiding her medicine somewhere unexpected or unusual, and the word "below" suggests that the medicine is hidden in a container. The choice "jar" works well as it is a commonly used container for storing items such as cookies or medicine. The other options (bathroom, doctor's office, taken orally, and hospital) do not fit the context of the sentence.
The keyword in the question is "drinking," which suggests that the people mentioned are engaged in the act of drinking something. None of the other options provide any clear indication of people drinking water, but "drinking" is a logical answer. The other options are unrelated to drinking water and do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The use of the phrase "written in Hebrew" suggests that this question is asking about a building that is associated with Jewish religious practices or culture. The options "classroom" and "suitcase" do not fit the criteria since they are not buildings. The options "library" and "library of congress" could potentially have books written in Hebrew, but they are not specifically associated with Jewish culture. The correct answer is "synagogue" since it is a building where Jewish people gather for worship and often contains a collection of Jewish religious texts written in Hebrew.
The sentence implies that the meeting was not conducted according to standard protocol, which suggests that it was more relaxed and casual. The word "informal" means not formal or relaxed in style or atmosphere, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately describe a meeting that is not conducted according to standard protocol.
The sentence indicates that drinking alcohol to excess can have negative consequences, suggesting that it leads to some sort of physical or emotional reaction. Of the choices given, vomiting is the most commonly associated with excessive drinking. This is because alcohol is a toxin that can cause nausea, and the body's natural reaction to remove it is to induce vomiting. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that if someone is very rude while expressing themselves, a negative consequence is likely to occur. Being slapped is a common response to rude behavior, and it fits with the given context of expressing oneself. The other choices do not have a clear connection to rudeness or negative consequences.
The sentence suggests that the girl who was usually ignored was now receiving attention from a boy who was flirting with her. This change in the girl's social situation is likely to make her feel happy as she is finally getting the attention she craves. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Fainting and problems are not relevant to the girl's emotional state, while anger and jealousy are more likely to be experienced if the boy was flirting with someone else.
The sentence suggests that the roommates were living in an apartment with only two bedrooms, which means there was not enough space for all three of them to have their own bedroom. Therefore, one of the roommates had to sleep on the couch in the common area of the apartment. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Discovering the truth in a crime can provide a sense of closure and justice not only for the victim but also for the investigator. It relieves them from the burden of feeling responsible for an unsolved case and provides them with the satisfaction of knowing that they have done their job well. Therefore, finding the truth will bring peace of mind to the policeman. The other options do not reflect the positive outcome of discovering the truth in a crime.
The sentence suggests that the weasel found a place to live, which is most likely a natural setting. Among the given choices, the options that don't fit this criteria are law office and in the car. Backyards could be a possibility, but the use of the phrase "hollow log" indicates that the weasel found shelter in a natural object. The forest is a natural environment where hollow logs could be found, making it a plausible but less specific answer than "hollow log."
The sentence indicates that Billy had information that is essential for Lorna to find a solution to her problem. The other options - bus stand, turn lock, front door, and open doors - do not relate to the idea of Billy holding key information that is necessary for Lorna to find a solution to a problem.
The term "government" typically refers to the system of ruling and administering a country, which implies the presence of a political structure. A democracy, by definition, is a form of government where power is held by the people or their elected representatives. The other answer choices are either specific physical locations (Washington D.C, White House, Capitol Building) or vague concepts (civilization) that do not necessarily indicate the presence of a government.
The question asks for something that is important for farmers to have at the beginning, and "farm land" is the most essential resource for any farmer. Without land, there can be no farming. The other answer choices may also be important for farmers, but not as critical as having the actual land to work on.
The phrase "best friends" suggests a close relationship characterized by trust and intimacy. Keeping secrets is often seen as a key aspect of such a relationship, while the other options listed are more generic activities that could be done with acquaintances or less close friends.
The sentence suggests that there was a high demand for hotel rooms due to a big convention happening, which may be taking place in a city. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Michigan is a state and cannot be fully booked like hotel rooms. Bedroom and bathing refer to specific parts of a hotel room, rather than a location. A resort may have more availability than a city, as it could have more rooms, so it does not fit the context of the sentence.
Playing a triangle is a musical skill, and orchestras are a type of musical ensemble that commonly use a triangle as a percussion instrument. It is unlikely that someone would be paid specifically to play a triangle in other contexts, such as a math book or math class. Music class may also be a viable option, but the specificity of the question suggests that the intended answer is orchestra. Pythagoras theorem is not related to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the killing was brutal and messy, as the killer used a blunt instrument which would have caused a lot of bleeding. The phrase "no way to clean up" implies that the scene was too gruesome to be cleaned up easily. The options "dies," "freedom," and "sorrow" have no connection to the context of the sentence, whereas "finger prints" may have been mentioned if the focus was on the forensic aspect of the crime scene, which is not mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person being talked about has not been seen in a long time and that a significant amount of time has passed. The word "young" implies that the person was once a child or young adult, and the options that suggest the person has aged or become a senior are too specific or extreme for the context. The correct answer, "grow," indicates a more general and natural progression of time and development, which is the most likely scenario when years have passed since someone was last seen.
Real estate agents are usually trying to sell homes and make them more appealing to potential buyers. They often use descriptive language to make the home sound more attractive, such as highlighting its charm or unique features. Using negative terms like "cover up," "exaggerate," or "incompetent" would not accurately describe the typical behavior of a real estate agent. "Smile" is unrelated to describing homes and is instead a general behavior that could apply to anyone.
The sentence suggests that the litter is thrown out of a moving car, which makes it likely to collect on a stretch of road rather than a stationary location such as a park or street corner. Highways and roadsides are common areas for litter to accumulate due to their high traffic volume and lack of regular maintenance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where a cat should be in a house, suggesting that there is a particular area in a house that is best for a cat. The choices "backyard" and "back yard" are not typically areas where cats would be inside a house. "Rug" and "floor" are both surfaces rather than specific areas of a house, and do not provide enough context to answer the question definitively. "Room" is the most appropriate choice because it refers to a specific area inside a house where a cat is likely to spend most of its time.
The sentence states that the person was unable to continue running after completing 100 miles, which suggests that they were experiencing some kind of physical difficulty. The phrase "couldn't any more" implies that it was not due to losing motivation or giving up willingly. Therefore, the most likely explanation would be that they were experiencing shortness of breath, which is a common issue for endurance athletes. The other options may also be possible, but they are less directly related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the building goes through a regular occurrence that can happen every day, which narrows down the choices to "it gets dark" and "casts shadow". The phrase "around half of the time" implies that the occurrence happens during a specific time of day (i.e. when the sun is at a certain angle). Since buildings do not naturally get dark on their own, "cast shadow" is the correct answer. "Face north", "target", and "fall down" do not fit the context given in the sentence.
The question is asking about the potential consequence of sitting down for an extended period, which is often associated with feeling tired or drowsy. This makes "fall asleep" the most likely answer. The other options are possible outcomes as well, but are not as directly related to sitting for a long time. For example, "sigh of relief" could be a response to discomfort, but not necessarily related to falling asleep. "Flatulence" is possible due to sitting, but not a common outcome. "Stand up" and "lap comes back" are possible, but not directly related to feeling tired after sitting for a long time.
The sentence suggests that the action of comforting a friend would involve showing kindness and empathy. Options "cook" or "make tea" do not necessarily relate to comforting someone, while "hurtful" is the opposite of what is expected in this situation. "Friendly" and "hug" are both appropriate ways to comfort someone who is going through a difficult time, as they demonstrate care and support.
When someone gains more land, it can lead to disputes with neighbors or other parties who claim ownership or use rights to that land. This can happen due to misunderstandings or disagreements about boundaries, easements, or other legal issues related to land ownership. The other options are not directly related to the negative consequences of gaining more land.
A cabinet is a common storage solution for items that are not immediately needed. It provides a secure place to store items, protects them from damage, and keeps them organized. Notebooks are portable and typically used for taking notes, so they are not a good option for long-term storage. Classrooms are not typically used to store personal items. A suitcase and portfolio are designed for travel and transportation, so they would not be a practical storage solution.
The sentence indicates that the sloth was slow-moving while transitioning from one vine to another. This behavior is typical of sloths, which are arboreal animals native to the rainforests of Central and South America. The phrase "tropical jungle" is commonly used to describe the sloth's habitat, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a device with two wheels that is popular with children. The options "coaching," "vehicle," and "car" do not fit this criteria, as they are not typically associated with children's toys or activities. The option "cars, bicycles, etc." is too broad and not specific enough. The correct answer is "bicycle," as it is a common toy and form of transportation for children, and is well-known for having two wheels.
Snakes often hide in places where they can stay out of sight and avoid detection, and a ditch provides a perfect hiding spot. Ditches are often overgrown with vegetation, which can provide cover for the snake, and they can also provide a convenient route for the snake to move from one area to another. The other options either do not provide enough cover or are not typically found in the United Kingdom.
The mention of carpet and hardwood floors suggests that the location has a recreational purpose as opposed to a residential location like a bedroom. Since Joe is going there to have a good time with his friends, it's likely a social location. Among the given options, a bowling alley is the most logical choice as they typically have a mix of carpet and hardwood floors for players to walk on. The other options, such as a hotel or a zoo, do not have any clear connection to the context.
The question is asking where it is safer to keep a marmot, suggesting that there may be risks involved in keeping them in certain places. While it is possible to keep a marmot as a pet, it is important to provide a secure enclosure for their safety and the safety of those around them. A cage is a common way to keep marmots safely contained, and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not offer the same level of security or protection, and may not be suitable for keeping a marmot.
The sentence suggests that the state in question is mitten-shaped, which is a well-known descriptor for the state of Michigan. Additionally, tennis courts are commonly found at country clubs and health clubs, which are listed as options in the choices. Florida is not mitten-shaped and does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "very high tech computers" suggests that the computers being referred to are advanced and sophisticated, which are often found in professional settings such as offices. While it is possible to have high tech computers in other locations like a library or home, the tone of the sentence implies that they are most commonly found in a workplace. The space shuttle may have advanced technology, but it is not a location where computers are typically found. "Desktop" is not a location, but rather a type of computer.
"Store" is the most likely answer because it is a place where someone can purchase goods or services in exchange for money. "Pocket" refers to where someone might keep money, but it is not a place where money can be spent. "Casino" is a place where people gamble with money, but not necessarily spend it on goods or services. "Supermarket" and "cash register" are places where people can buy goods, but they are not the only places where someone can spend money.
The sentence suggests that the announcement was unexpected and confusing, and it had a significant impact on the nation. Bringing the nation to a standstill implies that the announcement was so significant that it caused people to pause or stop what they were doing. This kind of impact would not be associated with pain, scandal or controversy, as those ideas suggest negative reactions to the announcement, whereas standstill implies that the reaction was more neutral, perhaps just shock or surprise.
Inflation and recession are often viewed as opposing economic forces. Inflation can cause prices to rise, which reduces the value of money, while a recession is characterized by a decrease in economic activity and spending. Fighting inflation can help to prevent a recession by keeping prices stable and maintaining the value of money. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the notebook is something that the person carries with them when it is not in use. Lockers, desktops, classrooms, and offices are all stationary locations, which means it is less likely that the person is carrying their notebook with them in those places. A backpack, however, is a portable item that is often used to carry personal belongings including a notebook, so it is the most likely choice.
The context of the sentence implies that the answer is related to something that happens in a court of law to satisfy or alleviate curiosity. Hearing testimony is a common practice in court where witnesses or experts are called to provide sworn statements of their knowledge or observations related to the case. The other options like searching on a computer or surfing the net are not related to the traditional court setting and therefore, can be ruled out. Examining something or seeing exhibits may be part of some court proceedings, but it does not necessarily alleviate curiosity.
The sentence compares the punctuality of trains and airplanes, suggesting that one is typically on time while the other is not. The phrase "on the other hand" further emphasizes this contrast. Of the choices, "arrive late" is the most fitting option, as it aligns with the idea that airplanes are less reliable in terms of timing. The other options are either irrelevant or do not correspond to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for what is necessary to do before beginning work on a computer, and out of the choices given, only "sitting down" makes logical sense as a step to take before starting work. Screaming for hours, panicking, being tired, and procrastinating are not productive or necessary steps to take before starting work on a computer, and would likely hinder productivity instead of helping it.
The sentence suggests that there are two types of people: those who make an effort and succeed in life, and those who do not put in any effort and fail to achieve anything. The phrase "amount to nothing" is commonly used to describe people who have no accomplishments or success in their lives. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Strip malls are commonly known for housing a variety of smaller businesses and service providers, such as dental offices, hair salons, and small shops. This is distinct from a medical building, which is usually larger and serves as a hub for medical professionals and services. Town and urban area are too broad and vague to give a clear answer, while an office can refer to any type of workplace and is not specific enough to indicate that there is a dental office present.
The sentence suggests that a personal washing machine is being referred to, which implies that it is a smaller appliance meant for personal use rather than for commercial cleaning services. The other options do not make sense in the context of a personal washing machine. Clean dishes are typically washed in a dishwasher, laundromats are used for larger loads of laundry, streets have no connection to washing machines, and cellars are not typically used for washing clothes.
The sentence suggests that kicking a ball is related to a particular activity or location. Soccer is a sport that involves kicking a ball, and games are typically played on a specific type of field designed for this sport. A child's hand and toy store may be related to playing with a ball, but the context of the sentence indicates that the activity being referred to is a sport. Arena does not necessarily imply a specific activity, and could refer to various types of events being held there.
Lightning rods work by providing a path of least resistance for lightning to follow, directing the electrical charge into the ground where it can safely dissipate. Therefore, the end of a steel cable used as a lightning rod would need to be connected to the ground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence indicates that the speaker is comparing themselves to others and feeling inadequate, specifically in regards to what everyone else has that they do not. This suggests that the correct answer is jealousy, as the feeling of envy or coveting what others have is a common cause of social discomfort and exhaustion. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of continuous change. Attributes typically involve measuring the rate of change, such as the slope or curvature of a graph, which would require the use of calculus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of calculating attributes.
The sentence suggests that the act of killing has legal consequences, which may include being punished for the crime by being imprisoned. The other options do not address the legal aspect of the question and are not likely consequences for this particular situation.
Having a light, healthy lunch typically means that you are consuming foods that are low in calories and high in nutrients. These types of foods can promote feelings of fullness and satiety without causing discomfort or digestive issues like vomiting. Feeling satisfied is also a possible outcome of having a light, healthy lunch. Spending money may or may not be related to this question, depending on the context. Obesity is not likely to be a direct result of having a light, healthy lunch, but it could be a long-term consequence of consistently making healthy food choices.
The sentence suggests that the focus is on a Canadian farmer who is wondering if potatoes will grow in his location. Prince Edward Island is known for its potato farming industry and is often referred to as the "Potato Capital of Canada." Ireland is also known for its potato farming, but it is not related to the context of the Canadian farmer. "Main course" and "French fries" are not locations but rather food-related terms. Idaho is known for its potato farming industry as well, but the sentence mentions that the farmer is located in Canada, not the United States.
The sentence suggests that the picture was created by a professional artist, and the option "art show" is the most likely place where a professional's work would be displayed. Art shows are exhibitions where artists showcase their work to the public, and these events provide a platform for artists to sell their work to collectors and enthusiasts. The other options, such as "wall" or "shelf," do not provide enough context to determine where a professional's work might be displayed.
The sentence implies that Bob needed a container to keep the ball bearings from scattering around. A can is a common item used to store small objects like screws, bolts, and ball bearings. Machines and high quality motors may use ball bearings, but it does not make sense for Bob to store loose ball bearings in a machine or motor. The pool and church have no relevance to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person may be experiencing discomfort from using a computer at night. This discomfort is likely to be caused by eye strain, as looking at a bright screen in a dark room can be tiring for the eyes. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not offer any explanation for the person's behavior.
The sentence suggests that the person next to the speaker is talking on her cell phone a lot, which implies that she is likely engaged in conversation. The option "talk about themselves" is the most relevant because it fits the context of someone talking on their phone frequently. None of the other options are directly related to talking on a cell phone.
The word "pawn" suggests that the person was being used or manipulated by their partner for a larger purpose. The fact that the police were involved suggests that the scheme may have been illegal or unethical. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the meaning of the word "pawn."
The sentence implies that smoking is not allowed inside the building and that if someone wanted to smoke, they would have to go outside. The other options (unhealthy, coughing, foolish, inhale) are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide any logical connection to the idea of smoking outside.
The word "lazy" suggests that the person wants to minimize effort and avoid difficulty, making an "easy life" the most logical answer. The other options may be desirable, but they do not necessarily relate to a lazy person's desires. However, it is important to note that this question relies heavily on subjective interpretation and individual perspectives on laziness.
The sentence suggests that the boat needs to be stored during the harsh winters. While a locker or a warehouse could be possible options for boat storage, the most commonly used option is a dedicated building, such as a boathouse or a storage facility. Michigan is one of the Great Lakes and is not a location for boat storage. In the cupboard is not a feasible answer as it is not large enough to store a boat.
The sentence suggests that the individual is feeling a sensation of spinning while climbing. Vertigo is a medical term that refers to a feeling of dizziness or spinning, usually caused by a problem with the inner ear or the brain. It is commonly associated with heights, motion sickness, and certain medical conditions. The other options do not accurately match the symptoms described in the sentence.
Perjury is a term used to describe lying under oath or providing false information while testifying in court. Therefore, the correct answer would be lies as someone committing perjury would likely be providing false information. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the definition of perjury. A miscarriage of justice could result from perjury, but it is not a characteristic of the person committing perjury. Guilt may or may not be a factor for someone committing perjury. Truth and testify are not directly related to the act of committing perjury.
The sentence implies that theaters have a common location, and the context suggests that this location is likely to be in a city or urban area. The choice "shopping mall" is unlikely, as theaters are not often found within shopping malls. "In buildings" is too vague, as many different types of buildings could house theaters. "New York City" may be a valid option, but the phrase "typically located" suggests that the answer should apply to theaters in general, not just those in one specific city. "Populated area" is also vague and could apply to many different types of locations. Therefore, "downtown area" is the most appropriate choice, as many theaters are often found in the downtown areas of cities.
The term "weasel" is often used to describe politicians who are sneaky or untrustworthy. Public office is a position that involves political power and decision-making, making it a likely target for this type of criticism. The other options, such as "out of doors" or "swimming pool," do not have any clear connection to politics or the negative connotation associated with the term "weasel."
"Adult engineer" implies that the person is a professional in the field of engineering. It is reasonable to assume that an engineer would spend most of their time working on engineering-related tasks, whether it be designing, researching, or managing projects. None of the other answer choices have a clear connection to the profession of engineering.
Losing a pet, especially a beloved dog, can be a very emotional experience. The sentence implies that the person had a negative emotional response to the news of their dog running away, which is similar to feeling depressed. The other options do not relate to the emotional state of the person in this scenario.
The sentence presents a contrast between the man's negative prospects and his positive attitude. The word "enthusiastic" is the most appropriate choice because it implies that the man is hopeful and excited about the future, despite his current difficulties. The other options, such as "splendid" and "glorious," are too positive and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Cheerful" and "excited" are somewhat related, but do not convey the same level of optimism and energy as "enthusiastic."
The use of the words "joinery" and "paneling" suggest that the craftsman created a decorative or ornate surface for a vertical surface, which would be a wall. The other choices are all types of doors, which would not typically be decorated with joinery and paneling.
The sentence implies that despite struggling with a mental illness, the individual was able to handle it to some extent. Therefore, "managed" is the most logical choice among the given options. "Recur" means to happen again or repeatedly, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. "Cause irrational behavior" and "cause hallucination" are both negative outcomes of mental illness, and it doesn't align with the idea that the individual was able to handle it to some extent. "Effectively treated" is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily align with the idea that she still had mental illness her whole life.
The sentence mentions that Sarah couldn't stand living without an air conditioner during the summer, which suggests that she is in a hot location. The option "texas" is the most logical choice as it is a state known for its hot and humid summers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people spend time chatting with friends for a specific reason. The option "moroseness" is unlikely to be the reason since it means being in a sad or gloomy mood. "Laughter" is often a byproduct of spending time with friends, but it is not the primary reason. "Gathering of information" is also unlikely to be the reason since it suggests a more formal or professional setting. Instead, the most likely reason is to feel closer to their friends, which is a common motivation for socializing with others. The option "feel relaxed" may also be a possible answer, but it is not as clear-cut as the option "feel close to."
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to improve their ability to save for retirement, which typically involves investing money in order to grow wealth over time. The stock market is a common avenue for long-term investing, as it provides the opportunity to earn returns on shares of companies that perform well over time. None of the other options have any clear connection to investing or saving for retirement.
The sentence mentions a referee blowing a whistle and citing a rule in reference to a play, which is a common occurrence in sports games such as football. The option "superbowl" further reinforces the idea that the sentence refers to a high-profile, competitive game. The other options, such as "classroom" and "family situation," do not match the context of the sentence.
The other options are not typically associated with finding information. Asking questions may be a part of the process, but it is not the main method of finding information. Logic is a tool used to analyze and understand information, but it is not a means of finding it. Engaging in tasks and using time may help in gathering information, but they are not direct methods of finding it. Searching for information involves actively looking for it through various sources and methods.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for vegetables, which is commonly associated with shopping at a market. Additionally, the option "bookstore" does not relate to the context of the sentence, while the options "library" and "train station" are unlikely places to buy magazines. The option "gardening" could be a possibility, but it is less likely than "market" since the sentence implies that the person is already at a location where they can buy vegetables.
Going into a trance can have different effects depending on the individual and the situation. Disorientation, confusion, and loss of control are common experiences during some forms of trance, while closed eyes and hallucinations may also occur in some cases. Without more context for this question, it is impossible to determine which of the choices is the correct answer.
The question implies that the train is approaching a station and must take a certain action before reaching it. The most logical action for a train to take before arriving at a station is to slow down to a safe speed. The other options do not fit the context of the question or are unlikely scenarios. A train passing slowly or slowing past a stop are not clear actions and arriving early or late are outcomes, not actions.
The sentence suggests that the person had been sleeping in and feeling tired all day. Therefore, switching to getting up early must have made a difference by making him feel refreshed. This means that feeling tired is the opposite of feeling refreshed, and is the correct answer. Bloodshot eyes, alertness, starting early, and happy are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the boy has a skill in making friends. Therefore, the most immediate and obvious result of this skill would be that he would have friends. Popularity, happiness, good feeling, and conflict could also be possible outcomes, but they are not as directly related to the boy's ability to make friends as having friends themselves.
The word "engineer" commonly refers to a person who designs, builds, operates, or maintains machinery and systems, including trains. Therefore, it is likely that an engineer would be responsible for driving a train while on the job. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context implies that the question is asking for a safe place to keep personal money. Out of all the choices, keeping money in a pocket would likely be the safest option as it is close to the body and can easily be monitored. Supermarkets and art shows do not have any relevance to the question, while keeping money in a cash register or a bucket of water would be risky and not a recommended practice.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to a place where adults gather to watch football games. While college campuses may also have football fields where people gather, the use of the word "high school" suggests that this is the intended answer. High school football games are often a social event for adults in the community, and the other options do not provide any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the child was using his imagination to create a pretend scenario where regular items were parts of his spaceship. This requires the ability to think creatively and come up with innovative ideas. The other options, such as acting skills or alien intelligence, don't fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The word "communicating" suggests that the correct answer involves a method of exchanging information. The word "aliens" suggests that this exchange may not be a communication method commonly used by humans. The options "effort," "farting," "laugh," and "medium" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, but "thinking" could be a possible answer as it is a communication method used by most intelligent species. "Speculating" suggests that this is not a proven fact, but rather a hypothesis or theory.
The phrase "man's best friend" is often used to describe dogs, indicating a strong bond and loyalty between humans and dogs. This loyalty can be attributed to the pack mentality of dogs, which makes them highly social animals that thrive on companionship and loyalty. The other options in the choices do not relate to the idea of loyalty, making "faithful" the correct answer.
The sentence refers to the act of talking, which involves producing sound waves in the air that can be heard by others. The answer choice "voice" specifically relates to the sound waves produced by the vocal cords in the throat when speaking. The other answer choices, such as "being alive" or "brain," are not directly related to the act of talking and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cleanup crew is finding something on the highway during cleanup, and they always come off of a specific object. The options "propeller," "datahub," "wash," and "electric fan" do not make sense in this context. However, it is common to find hubcaps or other small parts from car wheels on the side of the road during highway cleanup, making "car wheel" the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the delivery man brought a new computer that is being delivered to the recipient. The recipient's anticipation to open it implies that the computer is inside a box. The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence.
The sentence explicitly states that the person being referred to was a servant, as indicated by the fact that they were asked where to put flowers. The other options, such as celebrity or rich person, do not fit the description of someone who would be tasked with arranging flowers at a wedding.
The sentence suggests that the behavior being described is considered rude in a certain context where people watch something. The options "fair," "carnival," and "bowling alley" do not typically involve quiet activities that require concentration or have a social expectation of silence, so they can be eliminated. The option "classroom" could be a possibility, but this context usually involves interaction between a teacher and students, so noise and commentary could be appropriate depending on the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is "movie theatre," where people usually watch movies in a quiet and respectful environment.
Watching television is a common activity that takes place in a comfortable and relaxed setting, such as a living room in a house. Parks are usually outdoor recreational spaces, and motels are temporary lodgings that may not have a separate area for watching TV. Bars may have TVs, but they are not typically associated with a family-friendly atmosphere for watching TV together.
The sentence suggests that the action taken is advancing towards a particular goal. "Make trouble" and "gone to sleep" are opposite actions to progress. "Take time" and "make haste" are actions that focus on the speed of the action but do not necessarily imply progress towards a goal. Therefore, "make progress" is the best answer.
The question implies that snow can cause damage if there is too much of it in a certain location. Out of the five choices, roofs are the most likely to be damaged by excessive snowfall, as the weight of the snow can exceed the load capacity of the structure, causing it to collapse. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Feathers are a distinctive feature of birds and are often used for flight or insulation. It is common for birds to shed their feathers during moulting season, and they can also lose feathers due to injury or stress. The other options, such as wings and legs, are important parts of a bird's anatomy but are not typically known to "fall off." The option about keeping in a zoo is not relevant to the question.
Bread is typically stored at room temperature in a breadbox or pantry, as refrigeration can cause the bread to become stale and the moisture can cause mold to grow more quickly. Storing bread in a plastic bag can reduce air circulation and cause condensation, which can also lead to mold growth. Toasters are used for heating bread, not storing it. A box may be used for storage, but it depends on the specific type of box and whether it provides adequate ventilation.
The word "suffering" is a clue that indicates a medical problem. The other options do not provide a suitable location for someone who needs medical attention. A reception area in a hospital is typically where patients wait to receive medical treatment, making it the most appropriate answer. The other options, such as motels, drug stores, and hotels, do not usually have medical facilities, and people is not a specific location.

The sentence suggests that hard work will lead to a positive outcome, which is commonly associated with doing well or succeeding. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy's living situation is not allowed due to a certain restriction. Living in a state park is often prohibited due to environmental impact concerns and the desire to preserve natural habitats. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jon put drops in his eyes to prevent them from becoming too dry. If the eyes become too dry, they can become irritated and uncomfortable, so it is common to use drops to help keep them lubricated. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the issue of dryness in the eyes.
The sentence suggests that the person has not been in their hometown for a long time and upon returning, they express a desire to build new relationships by making friends. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence; forgiving, buying presents for others, and loving do not have a clear connection to the idea of returning to one's hometown and building new relationships.
The sentence suggests that the action being described is related to leaf removal or disposal. The word "rake" implies that the leaves are being gathered and moved intentionally. The options "forest," "floral arrangement," and "basement" do not make sense in this context. "Trees" could be a possible answer, but it does not fully capture the action of actively removing and disposing of leaves. "Compost pile" is the best answer as it is a common and practical way to dispose of leaves and turn them into nutrient-rich compost.
The term "mid-ranking officer" implies that James is not in charge of a large military unit like an army, but rather a smaller group. The term "company" is commonly used to describe a military unit consisting of 80-250 individuals, which matches the context of the sentence. The other options, such as "battle" or "army", refer to larger military groups and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Pack" and "renegades" are not commonly used to describe military units.
The options "library", "ocean", "bedroom", and "bookends" do not make sense as they are not places where someone would typically purchase a new bookshelf. A "furniture store" is a logical choice as it is a place where someone would go to purchase furniture, including bookshelves.
The context suggests that the situation involves a parent who is concerned about their child's lack of socialization and exposure to the outside world. The most appropriate action to take in this situation would be to call the child and take steps to encourage them to engage in activities outside the home and interact with other people. The other options do not provide a practical solution to the problem described in the question.
Changing lanes is a driving technique primarily used on roads and highways, which makes choices such as grocery store, bowling alley, and rural countryside irrelevant. The correct answer, therefore, is highway, whereas street could have also been an option but does not specify the type of road, making it less specific.
The sentence implies that Mario was away from his family, and he was excited to meet them. "At home" and "being here" do not provide any relevant information about who Mario met, while "present" and "home team" are not related to the context of the sentence.
Gasoline is not naturally occurring and needs to be processed in order to be used as fuel. Refineries are specifically designed to convert crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products. The other options are not relevant as they do not involve the process of creating gasoline from crude oil.
The question asks where millions of apple trees can be found, and an orchard is a place where fruit trees are grown for commercial purposes. Apple orchards are particularly common in certain regions, such as Washington state in the United States, which is known for producing a large amount of apples. The other options do not suggest a clear connection to the context of the question, and therefore are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person needed new clothes before starting high school. The most likely place to find new clothes for school would be a mall, which typically has a variety of clothing stores. The other options, such as ocean floor, container, or downtown area, do not have any logical connection to the sentence.
The question is asking what a teacher is required to do for her students. The correct answer would be to provide them with knowledge to improve their education. State facts may be part of teaching, but it is not specific to what a teacher is required to do. Making lunch and timing tests are not necessarily requirements for a teacher, and grouping students may be a strategy but not a requirement.
The question is asking for a good activity for two children to do together, which rules out solitary activities like watching television or listening to music. The choices "reach over" and "running" are not specific enough to be considered activities on their own. However, "play chess" is a two-player game that requires both players to participate and can be a fun and engaging activity for children to do together.
The sentence suggests that the rich kid tried to bribe the professor with money to achieve a certain outcome. The only option that makes sense in this context is "pass course." The other options do not fit the situation described in the sentence.
The question mentions a musician playing a specific instrument, the snare drum, in a specific location, a theater. While the other choices may also involve music performances, they do not involve the specific instrument or location mentioned in the question. An orchestra is a group of musicians who perform together in a theater and typically includes a percussion section, which would likely include a snare drum player.
The question asks for the opposite of "someone from the east." The options "north" and "westward" are directions and do not refer to people specifically. "Westerly" is an adjective that describes something that is located in or moving toward the west, and "eastside" refers to a particular location within a larger area. Therefore, "western" is the only option that specifically refers to someone who is not from the east, as it refers to people or things from the western direction.
The sentence suggests that Sarah has skill with a brass drum, which is a common instrument used in marching bands. This is further supported by Jane's request for Sarah to join her, which implies that the performance is likely a marching band concert. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "minimalist" is often associated with a lifestyle that emphasizes simplifying one's possessions and focusing on experiences rather than material things. Therefore, it makes sense that the desired outcome for someone who has become a minimalist would be to achieve freedom from wanting or desiring more material possessions. The other options, such as peaceful sleep or a new computer, do not align with the ideals of minimalist living.
The sentence suggests that the person is being dishonest, which means they are intentionally misleading others. Deception is a term commonly used to describe such behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Live in poverty refers to a state of financial deprivation, bad feelings is too general and doesn't address the context of the sentence, bipolar and schizophrenia are mental health conditions and not related to dishonesty.
The sentence suggests that the crew is being affected by the heat from the sun. The second part of the sentence indicates that the sun's heat is being reflected off something, which is causing additional heat. The options "moon," "desktop," and "beach" do not make sense in this context. The choice "sea" is the most logical, as the sun's rays reflect off the surface of the water, intensifying the heat.
The sentence suggests that the sender of the follow-up email did not receive a reply to their previous email. Therefore, the purpose of the follow-up email would be to inquire about the lack of response, or to ask for a response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be appropriate choices for the correct answer.
Whipped cream is typically not kept in a cupboard or refrigerator at home, unless it was just made. Whipped cream can usually be found in a store in a can or tub, or in a restaurant as a topping for desserts or drinks.
The question asks about what makes a person feel good, which is a subjective feeling. However, research suggests that receiving acknowledgment or praise for one's actions or accomplishments can boost self-esteem and increase feelings of happiness. The other options may also contribute to positive feelings, but may not be as universally applicable as receiving acknowledgment.
Alcohol is known to impair cognitive and motor functioning, leading to a state of disorientation. This can manifest in symptoms such as difficulty walking, slurred speech, and confusion. The other options are not typically associated with the effects of alcohol consumption.
Pharmacies typically sell medications, health and beauty products, and sometimes snacks and drinks, but they do not usually sell seasonal items like suntan lotion. The other options, like deli counters, grocery stores, and shops could potentially sell suntan lotion alongside food items. Beach bags are not places that sell anything, but rather an accessory used to carry items to the beach.
The sentence implies that Jane wants to ride a bike, which requires the skill of pedaling. Pedaling is the action of pushing the bike's pedals with your feet to move the bike forward. Laying down, falling over, and falling off are not skills needed to ride a bike; rather, they are accidental mishaps that may occur while learning to ride. Peddle is a misspelling of pedaling.
The sentence suggests that the special interest group was manipulating young people into believing they were making a difference, but really were just trying to maintain the two party political system. The option "vote" makes sense in this context, as it implies that the group may have been trying to influence young people to vote for their preferred political party or candidate. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A replica is an exact copy or reproduction of an object, including all of its details and features. Therefore, making a new copy of an original sculpture would result in a replica. The other options (copy, derivative, remake, and reproduction) could also technically apply, but they may not convey the same level of precision and accuracy as a replica.
The sentence suggests that the bee had to be moved to a warmer climate during the winter, which means that the bee's original habitat was a location with colder winters. Michigan is a state in the northern United States known for its harsh winters, so it is the most likely option among the given choices. The other options (United States, sky, China, apiary) do not provide any specific information about the bee's original location.
Apple trees typically bloom in the spring and produce fruit in the summer, with apples ripening at different times depending on the variety. Fall is when apples are typically harvested, indicating that the apples on the tree are ready to eat. Valley and Washington State are locations and have no relevance to the question.
The question implies that there is a common reason why people take dance classes. One possible reason is that they find it enjoyable, which would explain why almost all people take dance classes. Other options, such as expressing oneself or deepening a relationship, may be secondary reasons or specific to certain individuals, but having fun is generally the primary motivation for taking dance classes.
The sentence indicates that the person valued privacy and did not want people to watch them. "Turn away" is an action that would allow the person to act without being directly observed. The other options, such as rowing a boat or letting down something, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that fast food restaurants are ubiquitous in a particular country, which narrows down the options to locations within that country. The options "new york," "strip mall," "big cities," and "center of town" are all specific locations within a country or city, whereas "america" refers to an entire country. This knowledge, combined with the common perception that fast food restaurants are prevalent in America, supports the correct answer being "america."
The sentence implies a transactional process between a customer and a store. In order to acquire something from a store legally and ethically, one must purchase it by paying for it with money. Stealing is obviously not a correct answer as it is illegal and unethical. "Work hard" and "proactive" do not make sense in the context of getting something from a store. "Reach for" implies physical action, but does not necessarily result in obtaining the desired item from the store.
The sentence suggests that the injury is related to using a skate, which is a type of ice skate. Therefore, the most likely place for obtaining such an injury would be at an ice rink, where people commonly use skates for activities such as figure skating or ice hockey. The other options are not directly related to this context and do not provide any specific information about where the injury might occur.
The phrase "being caught" suggests that the celebrities in question did something they weren't supposed to do, and the word "useful" implies that going public helped them in some way. "High heel shoes" and "wide acceptance" don't seem relevant to the context of being caught, while "problems" is too vague. "Press coverage" could be a possibility, but it doesn't quite fit with the idea of being caught doing something wrong. "Getting high" is the best answer as it suggests a behavior that is socially unacceptable and could lead to negative repercussions if exposed.
The phrase "having fun in a big way" suggests that the experience is a positive one, which eliminates the options for stress relief, injuries, and hunger. Additionally, the phrase "having fun" is often associated with happiness and joy, which aligns with the choice of "glee". The final option, "may laugh," is not specific enough and does not capture the full range of emotions that someone having fun may feel.
A teacher would likely store their piano in a place related to their profession, seeing as the question is about a teacher's piano. The options 'music class', 'band' and 'music room' all relate to the teaching of music, while a 'piano store' is a business that sells pianos and would be an unlikely place for someone to store their piano. Therefore, 'music room' is the most appropriate answer.
The sentence suggests that the dad saw random stuff in the kitchen and didn't know where to put it, so he placed it somewhere in the kitchen. Out of the given choices, "table" is the most logical option because it is often used as a surface to place random items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the temperature was not sufficient for cooking turkey, which implies that it needed to be higher than it currently was. The options "drop rapidly," "lower temperature," and "drop to zero" all imply a decrease in temperature, which would make the situation worse. "Heat up" is a synonym for "increase," but "increase" is a more direct and specific answer to the question.
The phrase "get in trouble" often refers to breaking laws or regulations. Therefore, the option "commit crime" is the most relevant choice. The other options do not necessarily relate to legal trouble, as mail order and branch out refer to business practices, liquidated refers to ending a business, and procure refers to obtaining goods or services.
The use of the terms "orchestra pit" and "players coming on stage" suggest that Sally is in a venue where performances take place. The options that best fit this description are opera houses, auditoriums, music halls, and theaters. However, the term "butt" has no connection to the context of the sentence and would not be a plausible answer.
Wire shelving is commonly used in refrigerators to allow air to circulate and keep food items cool. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of wire shelving.
Utensils are typically stored in a drawer in the kitchen, making it the most plausible answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A backpack is not a typical storage location for utensils, a plate is a utensil itself and not a storage location, dinner is a meal and not a storage location, and a cupboard is a possible storage location but not the most common one for utensils.
The use of the word "close" in the sentence suggests that the joke was only understood by a select group of people, which is commonly associated with an inside joke. An inside joke is a type of humor that can only be appreciated by a group of people who share a common experience, such as close friends. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "get in more trouble" implies that the prisoner is already in trouble and is at risk of further punishment. Attempting to escape is a serious offense in prison and is likely to result in additional charges and harsher punishment. The other options may not necessarily result in more trouble for the prisoner or are unrelated to the context of the sentence (e.g. "fast for days").
The question is asking what trees do in order to reach sunlight when they are densely packed in a forest. Growing tall is a common adaptation among trees in this situation, as it allows them to reach above other trees and foliage to get access to sunlight. None of the other choices make as much sense in this context - burning, walling in or being covered in snow would all be detrimental to the trees, while growing in soil is a given for any plant.
The reference to old cowboy and Indians movies suggests a Western theme, which typically takes place in the American Southwest. Horses are an integral part of Western culture, and the region is known for its vast open spaces and rugged terrain, making it a natural setting for these movies. While other regions, such as Canada or England, may have horses and movies set in the past, they are not typically associated with the cowboy and Indians genre. The Triple Crown and Kentucky Derby are both horse races, but they do not relate to the context of cowboy and Indians movies.
The sentence suggests that sporting goods stores are typically found in larger commercial areas like shopping squares or malls, but the privately owned shop being referred to is located somewhere smaller. The word "there" indicates that the location is not far away from the speaker. Among the choices, town seems to be the best fit as it suggests a smaller urban area that is not too far away. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not suggest a smaller urban area or do not make sense in the context of a sporting goods store.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is feeling guilty about committing perjury, so there is likely to be some discomfort or unease in her interaction with the prosecutor. This discomfort is described as a feeling of tension between them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not likely to be associated with the emotional experience of someone who is committing perjury.
The use of the term "servicemen" suggests that Jamie may be on a military base or near a location where military personnel are frequently found. The other options, such as a shopping mall or school, do not have a connection to the presence of servicemen in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that if someone were to abandon a pet at a shelter, the pet may be able to find a new family. The word "join" suggests that the pet would become a member of a new family, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit the context or have a negative connotation (such as "infect").
The sentence suggests that the person is more focused on the financial aspect of their work rather than the emotional or personal satisfaction. The phrase "bottom line" is a common business term referring to the final result or profit of a project. The other options such as "happiness," "very nice," "inspiration," and "fulfilling" do not indicate a desire for financial gain.
The sentence implies that the man's disability was turned into a positive attribute, which could be described as a source of strength. A strength can be seen as a personal quality that helps someone overcome challenges, which fits well with the idea of a motivational speaker. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or do not fit as well with the idea of turning a disability into an asset.
The context of the sentence suggests that it is referring to the act of moving or traveling from one place to another by means of a vehicle. The term "transportation" is often used to describe the act of moving people or goods from one place to another, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options, such as traffic jams and traffic accidents, are not accurate descriptions of the act of traveling from one place to another.
The sentence suggests that John had prepared a contract outlining the terms of his BDSM relationship with his new partner, and had it signed before allowing them to perform a certain act on him. The act is indicated to be something that involves the mouth, which narrows down the options to "oral." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the nature of the BDSM relationship described.
The sentence tells us that there are two doors on opposite sides of Broom, but he couldn't see them. This implies that the doors are not visible to him, suggesting that they might be hidden or disguised in some way. The option "invisible" fits this description, while the other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the doors cannot be seen.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker needed to wash their jeans because their electricity was cut off, which means they may not have access to a washing machine at home. A laundromat typically provides public access to washing machines and dryers, making it the most likely choice for where the speaker went. The other options are less relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not have any clear connection to washing clothes.
The use of "wildly erratic" suggests that the results were very unpredictable and inconsistent, which would make it difficult to obtain an accurate average. The word "strange" also fits with the idea of something being unpredictable and unusual. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James had difficulty learning French because of a lack of something, and the choices provided each represent a possible reason for his struggle. However, the word "never" in the sentence indicates that James may never have had a chance to experience something that would have made learning French easier. Exposure to a language means having contact with it, such as hearing it spoken or reading it in context, and is a crucial factor in language acquisition. The other choices do not fit as well because they all imply some degree of action or intention on James' part, which conflicts with the idea that he never had a particular experience.
The sentence suggests that answering uninteresting questions would result in a negative emotion. Boredom is a common feeling associated with lack of interest or stimulation, so it is the most likely answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the living room is a place where the family gathers, which is a common feature of a home. Additionally, the use of the word "common" suggests that this is an area of the house that is used frequently and is a central part of family life, which is also typical of a home. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a porch and formal seating are more specific areas within a home, a friend's house is not part of the living room, and an apartment could also have a living room but may not have the same connotations of family life.
The context of the sentence suggests that Lara was checking on something that could cause harm if it came loose. The options "electric fan", "datahub", "car wheel", and "gasoline" do not fit the context of the sentence. However, a loose propeller on a plane or helicopter could potentially cause a catastrophic accident that could result in the deaths of many people. Therefore, the correct answer is "propeller".
These options are all common places where people can buy clothing and appliances. A shop generally refers to a small store that specializes in a particular type of product, while a department store is larger and offers a variety of products in different departments. A mall is a large indoor shopping complex with a mix of stores and restaurants. Closet and garage sale are not typical places where people would buy new clothing and appliances.
Learning to ride a bike without training wheels requires the development of a sense of balance, which allows a person to maintain their equilibrium while in motion. While pedalling and practicing are both important parts of the process, neither can be effective without a sense of balance. Good balance is a key factor in being able to ride a bike, and doing wheelies is an advanced skill that requires a high level of balance mastery.
The sentence implies that someone may not like machines for a specific reason, which is that they can fail to work. This can be frustrating and may discourage people from using machines. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they do not provide a reason for why someone would not like machines.
The sentence implies that Betty considers being in love to be an important aspect of life. The other options may be associated with being in love, but not necessarily seen as necessary or vital according to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that love encourages people to fully engage with life and not hold back. "Live life" is a common expression that means to seize opportunities and make the most out of experiences, which is consistent with the idea that love can give people a sense of purpose and motivation. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wanted to play an instrument that would stand out and be heard over other noise, which is a characteristic commonly associated with marching bands. Marching bands often play loud, upbeat music during parades and sporting events, so it makes sense that someone would want to play an instrument that would cut through the noise. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the person is unhappy and looking for a way to end their suffering. While going to the doctor may help with certain aspects of their unhappiness, it may not necessarily end their overall suffering. "Further cause" and "wave goodbye" do not seem relevant to the context of the question. "Thank god" may indicate gratitude, but it is unlikely to provide a solution to the person's unhappiness. "Attempt suicide" is unfortunately a common and tragic way that some unhappy people might try to end their suffering.
The sentence suggests that the business show is discussing ways to fight inflation, and one of the options mentioned is to use a "certain percentage." This likely refers to a percentage increase in interest rates, which is a common tool used by central banks to combat inflation. Lowering prices or having money would not directly address inflation, and "more money" or "have money" are too vague to be appropriate answers.
The sentence implies that the soldier must comply with the instructions given by someone with a higher status, which is a common expectation in military structures. Following orders is a fundamental characteristic of military training and discipline, as it ensures that everyone in the chain of command is aligned with the mission and objectives. The other options do not reflect the established norms and expectations of military operations.
The phrase "for outside use" suggests that the suit is designed for activities performed outdoors. Among the choices, the only activity that is most commonly performed outdoors is rock climbing. Verdict and ruling are legal terms, while going to court refers to a legal proceeding rather than an activity or item. Swimming can be performed both indoors and outdoors, so it does not provide enough information to answer the question.
The sentence suggests that the person is so hungry that they are willing to go to any place besides McDonalds. The phrase "almost anywhere" emphasizes the wide range of options that the person is considering. The other options do not provide any additional information that would help in choosing the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person in question is traveling by train and has reached a platform where they need to leave their baggage. Leaving baggage at customs or on an airport carousel are both related to air travel, while leaving baggage on a cruise ship would be related to sea travel. Therefore, the correct answer is train station.
The sentence suggests that the woman in question is carrying a train ticket with her, and it would make sense for her to store it in a place that is easily accessible and secure. A purse is a common accessory that women often carry with them, and it can provide a safe and convenient place to store important items such as tickets. The other options do not make sense as logical places to store a ticket, as they are either locations (train depot, ticket booth, ticket office) or a person (conductor's hand) rather than an item that belongs to the woman.
The sentence suggests that Lilly is experiencing a physical sensation as a result of John's actions on her hips and butt. The word "euphoria" might seem like a possible answer, but it is an emotional state rather than a physical one. Hyperthermia refers to overheating of the body and is not related to the context. "Feeling comfortable" and "getting hot" are vague phrases that do not capture the specific sensation described in the sentence, leaving pleasure as the most accurate answer.
The sentence implies that the kids are feeling hot and want to cool off. The option "go swimming" is the most logical choice as it is a common activity people do to cool off during hot weather. The other options, such as "manual" and "think", have no clear connection to cooling off. "Relief" and "calm down" may offer some relief from feeling hot, but they do not indicate a specific action the kids would take.
The question is asking where people have screen savers of sunshine, which suggests that the answer is related to technology. Specifically, screen savers are typically associated with computer desktops, where they activate after a period of inactivity. The other options, such as street or glass, do not have any clear connection to the context of screen savers or sunshine.
The sentence suggests that John couldn't physically smile, but he found other ways to make the kids happy. Standing on his head implies he was able to do physical feats that amused the children. The phrase "but he made the kids happy" also suggests that he was doing something to entertain them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The words "big arched hallway" and "pay your bills or register to vote" suggest that the central passage is a part of a public building. Public buildings often have hallways and are used for administrative purposes like paying bills or registering to vote. The other options like thunderdome, tomb, and arena do not fit in the context of the sentence, while access rooms are not commonly associated with the activities mentioned in the sentence.
The word "desktop" implies a physical location where the telephone can be placed, such as on a desk or table. The other options do not fit as they are either unrelated (hospital, party, wires) or too broad (hotel).
The sentence suggests that talking someone down can have a positive effect on someone who is angry. The contrast between the strong emotion of anger and the suggested outcome of calmness highlights the calming effect that talking can have on an individual in such a state. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that males can have explicit fantasies while sleeping, and this can lead to stiff situations. In context, the word "stiff" likely refers to physical arousal, which is often accompanied by an erection in males. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence; nightmares and dreams may be related to sleep, but they are not related to explicit fantasies, death is a completely unrelated topic, and desires is too general to fit within the sentence's specific language.
The context suggests that the speaker did something with the new product for others to see. The word "demonstration" fits this context as it means showing how something works or how to do something. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Hatred" and "desk" are not actions, "shelf" does not involve showing something to others, and "conference" is too general and does not specify what the speaker did with the new product.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is religious and has ended their marriage. It implies that ending the marriage may conflict with their religious beliefs and values, which may lead to feelings of guilt or regret. The word "may" suggests that this is a potential outcome, but not a definitive one. The options "depression" and "grief" suggest negative emotions, while "happy" and "relief" suggest positive emotions, but neither accurately capture the potential conflict between religion and divorce. "Wrong" is the best fit as it aligns with the potential conflict and suggests that the person believes they made a mistake in getting divorced.
The sentence implies that living with an uncle is not a typical living arrangement, and that most families do not have this arrangement. Therefore, the correct answer would be "most families." The other options do not have any clear relation to the sentence.
Surfing involves being in the water for extended periods of time, and the water can be very cold. A wet suit is a type of clothing designed to keep the surfer warm while they are in the water. The other options are not related to surfing attire.
The sentence suggests that the subject frequently spends money that they don't have, which is a behavior that can lead to accumulating debt. The other options do not make sense in the context of overspending and financial irresponsibility.
A bearing is a mechanical component designed to help reduce friction between moving parts. Bearings often contain a ball or series of balls that allow for smooth movement and efficient operation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of containing a ball for efficient operation.
The sentence mentions that the moss was slippery due to constant moisture, which suggests that the nearby object was also a source of water. The most likely option is a waterfall, which can generate a lot of moisture and mist around it. The forest, grass, ground, and bridge do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Luke was previously unable to live freely, and was likely forced to work under someone else's control. Slavery is a system in which people are owned by others and forced to work without pay, and matches the description of Luke's previous labor conditions. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence suggests that the place that specialized in sports equipment was the only one of its kind in the town, making it a unique feature. A mall, on the other hand, is often known for having a variety of stores that sell different products, including sports equipment. This would explain why it seemed like the mall had a shop for everything. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Ferrets are commonly kept as pets, and they require a safe and secure living space. Because they are small and agile animals, they can easily hide in small spaces or crawl into tight corners. Therefore, it is important to provide them with an enclosure that is escape-proof and has plenty of hiding spots. While a ferret could potentially hide in a wood pile, a taxi cab, or even a cousin's house, these locations are not likely to provide the level of safety and security that a ferret needs. Hiding in a fridge could be dangerous and even deadly for a ferret, as they are not equipped to regulate their body temperature in cold environments.
The sentence implies that there is a specific reason why the cat is going to the castle and the most logical reason would be to see the king. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or are unlikely reasons for a cat to visit a castle.
The sentence suggests that Kuwait (and potentially other nearby locations) may not be commonly associated with a certain concept. However, the use of the word "region" implies that this concept is relevant to a specific area. The options "middle east" and "arabia" could also be valid choices, but "gulf states" is a more specific and accurate term for the region in question. "Kuwait" and "Asia" are not broad enough to describe the larger area being referred to in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally oversold the features of the homes she sold, which implies that she exaggerated their qualities or features. This behavior likely led to her reputation as a bad real estate agent, as people would have realized that she was not truthful or trustworthy. The other options may be possible, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The word "incorrect" suggests that there is an issue with the claim, and the options "forgive," "relinquish," and "give back" do not make sense in this context. "Disown" is not a common action for an insurance adjuster to take, so the most likely answer is "deny." The word "reject" also fits the context and meaning of the sentence, as the adjuster is not accepting or approving the claim.
The question is asking about a living being that has blood and parents, which is a characteristic unique to human beings. Blood banks, veins, and capillaries are physical parts of the circulatory system but do not have parents. Hospitals are medical facilities where people go for treatment but do not have blood or parents.
The sentence suggests that the man became tired while working, and then did something to alleviate that fatigue. The word "relax" is the only option that directly relates to this idea. "Sitting down" is too general and could be done for many reasons, while "procrastination" and "stress" are not actions that someone would take in response to feeling tired. "Getting tired" is already established as what happened to the man, so it cannot be the answer.
The question suggests that old models made of wood are being referred to. Of the choices provided, boats are commonly made of wood, particularly older models. While some cars may have had wooden elements, the primary construction material is not typically wood. Trees are living organisms, not man-made models, while hardware stores and lumberyards are not models at all, but rather places where building materials can be purchased.
The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a public space, specifically one that has an outside wall where a map might be displayed for public use. The options "possession" and "suitcase" do not make sense in this context, while "rest area" could potentially have a map, but it is less likely to be displayed on an outside wall. An "atlas" is a book of maps and not typically displayed on an outside wall either.
The sentence suggests that Susan found climbing the slopes difficult, which indicates that she may have preferred a more level terrain. Of the options provided, "flat ground" and "flat" are the most likely choices since they directly address Susan's discomfort with the slope. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Asthma is a medical condition that affects the lungs and causes difficulty in breathing. Asthma attacks occur when the airways become inflamed and narrow, making it difficult for air to pass through. This can result in symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. The other options, such as files, living, sustaining life, and giving life, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the question.
Heavy snow on a mountain can create unstable conditions and lead to avalanches, which are dangerous and potentially deadly. Shovelling might be necessary to clear paths or driveways, but it doesn't address the potential danger of heavy snow on a mountain. Eating cake and experiencing a blizzard are unrelated to the context of the question.
The fact that the spare wooden rod is kept with the cleaning supplies suggests that it is used for cleaning purposes. The most likely place to find cleaning supplies in a household is in a broom closet or utility closet, which is generally where cleaning tools such as brooms, mops, and buckets are stored. The other options - make a hammer, carpentry shop, old clock, old houses - do not relate to cleaning supplies or the use of a wooden rod.
Releasing fish after catching them is often associated with the practice of "catch and release" fishing, which is done for sport and conservation purposes. Anglers who participate in catch and release fishing often do so to enjoy the experience of fishing without harming the population of fish in a particular body of water. Wet clothes, boredom, and forgetfulness do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, while "catching fish" could be a possible answer but does not fully encompass the motivation to release the fish.
Blue birds are known for their melodious songs, which they use to communicate with each other and establish territories. While birds do spread their wings to fly and lay eggs to reproduce, these actions are not specifically associated with blue birds. Similarly, picking berries and screaming are not behaviors that are commonly attributed to blue birds.
The word "altar" is typically associated with religious settings, such as places of worship like temples or churches. The sentence suggests that this specific altar is at risk of vandalism, which implies that it needs to be moved to a safer location. The option "sanctuary" refers to a sacred or safe space within a religious building, making it the most appropriate choice for protecting the altar from potential harm. The other options may not provide adequate protection or may not be relevant to the context.
The sentence suggests that an activity may stop because of something happening to things involved in the activity. "Fall apart" is a common phrase used to describe something breaking or falling to pieces, which would likely cause an activity to come to a halt. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A tap show is a type of dance that involves tapping on hard surfaces with special shoes that have metal plates on the soles. In a bathroom, the floors and walls are made of hard materials like tile or porcelain, which can amplify the sound of tapping. A bathtub, in particular, is a hollow container made of metal or plastic, which makes it an ideal surface for creating loud and resonant tapping sounds. The other options, including water fountains and soda fountains, do not have a solid surface that would produce the same effect. Ohio is a location and not related to the question.
Horror films are typically designed to scare and frighten viewers, so the correct answer is fear. While some people may find horror films entertaining, the primary purpose of the genre is to elicit fear and suspense, making fear the most likely experience for viewers. Laughter and feistiness would be unlikely reactions, while insight is not a typical experience associated with watching a horror film.
The word "helping" suggests an action that contributes positively to others or society as a whole. This positive action is likely to generate positive emotions in the person performing it, leading to good feelings. The other options may also be associated with helping, but the particular wording of the question and the context surrounding the word "helping" suggest that good feelings are the most appropriate answer.
Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions in the wild, particularly in the northern hemisphere where there are colder climates. Marmots are not typically found near trees or on beaches, as they prefer open, rocky habitats. While there are some species of marmot found in specific regions, such as the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, they are still generally found in the wild rather than in urban or coastal environments.
When someone is getting in shape, it is usually to improve their overall health and wellbeing. Exercise and sweating are important parts of the process, but they are not the ultimate goal. Losing weight and loss of muscle may be a desired outcome for some, but they are not the only aspects of getting in shape. Good health encompasses many factors, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight and body composition.
Playing games for an extended period can lead to mental and physical exhaustion, which is commonly referred to as fatigue. It is natural to feel drained or tired after a long gaming session as the brain and body expend a lot of energy while being continually active. The other options, such as happiness or learning, may be experienced during gameplay, but they do not reflect the aftermath of playing games for an extended period.
The presence of canals is a key clue in this question. The Netherlands is known for its extensive network of canals and bike paths, making it a popular destination for cycling tourists. The other options do not have any connection to canals or cycling.
Smiling and whistling are both typically associated with positive emotions, such as happiness and contentment. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person is likely in a good mood. The options "homes," "greek tragedy," "sad," and "shopping mall" do not provide any information about the person's emotional state.
Beavers are known for their ability to chew through trees and branches to build their dams and lodges, but they also have strong teeth that can chew through other hard materials like rocks. While beavers are typically found in North America, the options "american forests," "great outdoors," and "Canada" are too broad and not specific enough to be the correct answer. "Pair of pants" is a silly option that is unlikely to be related to beavers' chewing habits.
The sentence implies that the company has a policy regarding retirement contributions, but it is not mandatory like the 8-hour workday. The word "elective" means optional or voluntary, which fits with the sentence's context. The other choices do not align with the idea that retirement contributions are not mandatory. The word "mandate" is the opposite of elective, and the words "optional" and "advisory" suggest that retirement contributions are not required, but they do not convey the idea that it is up to the employee to decide whether or not to make the contributions.
The sentence suggests that the man was selfish and took food from potlucks, which implies that he may not have been willing to share or give back. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "bleachers" and the use of the word "hooligans" suggest that this is a reference to a rowdy and possibly aggressive crowd at a sporting event. The use of "roared" and "chants" are also strong indicators of a football game, where fans are known to chant and cheer loudly in support of their team. The other options may have cheering fans, but they do not fit the description of a rowdy crowd using smoke bombs and chants.
The context of the sentence implies that the act of meditation involves contemplation, which typically refers to thinking deeply and/or focusing one's mind on a specific topic or issue. In this scenario, the goal of meditation is likely to achieve a state of mental clarity, which would involve having clear thoughts and a sense of focus. This option is therefore the best fit among the choices given. The other options do not align with the idea of contemplation or the purpose of meditation.
The sentence mentions seeing a robin, which is a type of bird. The blue egg is likely a reference to a bird's egg, indicating that the speaker is looking for a place where they might find a robin's nest instead of just an egg. A bird's nest is a common place for robins to lay their eggs, so it's the most likely answer. The other options (fridge, plate, yolk, and henhouse) have no clear relevance to the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a lonely and mentally disturbed person may resort to something for conversation. Of the choices provided, "talk to himself" best fits the context, as it is a common behavior for people experiencing loneliness and mental health issues. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cows are commonly found in rural areas or countryside, where there are large open fields or pastures for them to graze on grass. The other options - green field, dry fields, meat grinder, and red barn - are either specific features or objects that do not relate to the context of where cows graze.
Homes and businesses are typically concentrated in urban areas, such as big cities, because of the economic opportunities and access to resources that these areas provide. Nonprofit organizations, zoos, and office buildings may be located in cities, but they are not necessarily associated with a high concentration of homes and businesses. Skyscrapers, on the other hand, are a type of building commonly found in big cities that can house both residential and commercial spaces.
The sentence suggests that the coworker might ask you for a pen, indicating that you are likely in close proximity to each other. Keeping spares in a pocket would be convenient and easily accessible for both you and the coworker. The other options, such as a friend's house or a briefcase, are not relevant to the context of the sentence, which is focused on the workplace.
The sentence suggests that the boy is disobeying the teacher's orders by leaving the line. In most cases, disobedient behavior in the classroom leads to punishment. Utter chaos and trouble are unlikely outcomes since there's no indication that the boy's behavior is disruptive. Having to start over is an unlikely consequence for leaving the line, and a high five is an inappropriate response to disobedience.
The sentence indicates that the sick boy was reading letters sent by strangers, which suggests that the letters were likely sent to cheer him up and boost his morale. Since the boy is described as feeling happy while reading the letters, this suggests that they are having a positive impact on him emotionally. The other options (strain, realization, get news, and illness) do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical explanation for why the sick boy would feel happy while reading letters from strangers.
The phrase "on the hill" suggests that the hermit's place of living is likely a standalone structure rather than an apartment, hotel, condo, or loft. A dwelling is a general term that encompasses various types of homes, including cabins, cottages, and houses, and it fits the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that the hermit has both a bedroom and kitchen in his dwelling implies that it is a self-sufficient living space.
The sentence suggests that there is a vertical structure with a landing at the top that you have to walk up. This matches the description of a stairwell, where stairs lead up to a landing on each floor of a building. The other options, such as the ocean, airport, ladder or an apartment building, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not usually associated with having a landing to walk up at the top.
The sentence suggests that James has access to a tennis court that is located in his home, which is a feature commonly associated with country clubs. Country clubs often have tennis courts as part of their facilities, while parks and town centers typically do not have private tennis courts that are accessible from one's home. Michigan and sports do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is shopping for household appliances such as a washer and dryer. Therefore, it is likely that they went to an appliance store which specializes in selling household appliances. The other choices, such as an electronics store, theater or Vegas, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "master" suggests that this question is referring to someone who has achieved a high level of proficiency in a particular trade or craft. The phrase "all skills for a trade" suggests that the answer involves using those skills to provide guidance or instruction to others. The word "teach" is the only option that specifically refers to sharing knowledge and skills with others, whereas the other options either involve enforcing rules (require obedience) or developing one's own understanding of the trade (understand, learn, drill).
The sentence suggests that Sam noticed a shape that was similar to a trapezoid, which is a geometric shape that involves angles, lines, and measurements. Sam may have noticed this because he has an interest or knowledge in geometry, which focuses on studying these shapes and their properties. Architecture may involve geometric principles, but this is not necessarily related to the sentence's context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "when I have rest" implies that the person was doing something that required a lot of energy or effort before taking a break. The options "took it easy," "feel better," and "exhausted" suggest that the person was already at a state of relaxation or fatigue. "Were very tired" could be a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "worked all day," which directly relates to the idea of taking a break after completing a task.
Swiss cheese is known for its signature holes, which are created during the cheese-making process. The other options do not have any clear connection to the idea of having a hole in them. Cookies, notebook paper, and walls can have holes in them, but it is not a defining characteristic of these items. The ground does not typically have holes in it, unless it has been dug or disturbed in some way.
Maine is known for its fresh-caught lobster, which is often served in local steakhouses and seafood restaurants. Texas, Michigan, Kansas City, and Ohio are not typically associated with fresh-caught lobster, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that makes it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep, which would prevent someone from going to bed. Rest, on the other hand, is the act of relaxing or taking a break from activity, which actually encourages going to bed. Getting lost or pregnancy also do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, and making love may or may not prevent someone from going to bed depending on the circumstances.
Going to play is typically associated with seeking enjoyment and having fun. Children often engage in play to explore, learn, and develop social skills, which are achieved through enjoying themselves in the process. The other options, such as "rush" and "get hungry," are not typically associated with the reasons for play.
The sentence suggests that keeping breakfast light is a strategy to avoid a negative consequence when going to work. The most likely consequence of eating too much breakfast would be feeling full, which could make work uncomfortable or even difficult. Indigestion and stomachache are also possible consequences of eating too much, but they are less specific to work situations. Having energy and having a better day are potential benefits of eating breakfast, but they do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
When a person is dying, their body may go through physical changes such as a change in skin color. This is due to a lack of oxygen circulation and can result in a pale, blue, or mottled appearance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as they either relate to concepts outside the realm of human mortality (ceasing to exist, born again), or use unnecessarily repetitive or overly negative phrasing (no longer exist, would cease to exist).
After a concert, people typically applaud as a form of appreciation for the performance. This is a common practice in the music industry and is a sign of respect for the performers. Smiling and feeling accomplished may also be possible outcomes, but they are not directly related to the question of what happens after a concert. "Medium" and "music" do not make sense in the context of the question.
The question is asking about the biggest fear when opening a business, which implies that there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with this venture. Failure is a common fear for entrepreneurs, as it can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress. Making money and success are desirable outcomes, while too many customers may be challenging but ultimately beneficial for a business. Stress may be a symptom of fear or uncertainty, but it is not directly related to the specific question about opening a business.
November is typically associated with cooler weather, and people are more likely to catch a cold or flu during this time. Kissing can spread germs and increase the risk of catching a cold or flu virus, especially if one or both people are already sick. The other options may be possible outcomes of kissing in general, but they do not have a clear connection to the context of November or the potential risk of catching a cold.
The question is asking about what typically occurs to the knowledge base of a person who is in the process of learning. The correct answer is likely to be a positive outcome that indicates progress in the learning process. Intelligence and overconfidence may not always necessarily increase as a person learns, while knowing more and growth describe outcomes that are likely to occur when someone is learning new information. However, better understanding strongly suggests that the person is making progress in their comprehension of the subject matter they are studying.
The question is asking how plants continue their lineage if they can't move. Reproducing asexually is a common way for plants to create offspring without needing to physically move to a new location. Asexual reproduction can happen through methods like vegetative propagation or budding, where a part of the parent plant grows and develops into a new individual. The other options do not provide a viable way for plants to continue their lineage.
The sentence suggests that the person was looking through pictures to identify a suspect, which implies that the pictures contained images of people. The use of the word "faces" in the options further reinforces this suggestion. The other options - "person's head," "mammal," "potato," and "someone's face" - are not likely to be relevant in the context of identifying a suspect in pictures.
Bald eagles are a well-known symbol of the United States of America and are commonly associated with patriotism and national pride. They appear on the Great Seal of the United States and are often depicted in American art and literature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the bald eagle's symbolism or American culture.
The sentence suggests that James wanted his anemone (a type of flower) to grow and bloom, which would require proper care and nurturing. Placing the flower in a flower pot would be a common way to do this, as it provides a stable environment with soil and nutrients for the plant to grow. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not conducive to growing flowers.
The sentence suggests that the siblings fought often, which implies that they had a lot of disagreements. The phrase "had to make a rule for every" indicates that the mother was frequently creating rules to try to control the fighting. This would likely include rules for a wide range of topics, hence the choice of "everything" as the correct answer. The other options do not fit as well, as they are either too specific (text book, lawbook) or not directly related to the context (family situation, dinner time).
The sentence suggests that the object being described captures the air and uses it to create power. This is a characteristic commonly associated with a turbine, which is a type of engine that converts the energy from a moving fluid (such as air or water) into mechanical energy. The other options do not fit the description of an object that uses wind or air to create power.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to the act of preparing to sleep. The last thing most people do before they sleep is to close their eyes, which is a necessary step towards falling asleep. The other options, such as being an animal or doing somersaults, do not have a clear connection to the context and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The question is asking for another activity besides shopping that can be done at malls. Meeting friends is a common social activity that takes place at malls, as people often gather to socialize, grab a meal, or see a movie. While the other choices are related to shopping, they do not provide an alternative activity to shopping.
Sweating is a common physiological response to exercise, as it helps regulate body temperature and prevent overheating. While exercise may increase the body's need for food and water, and can potentially lead to injuries, sweating is a more direct and specific answer to the question. "Work out" is not really a physiological response, but rather a description of the activity being performed.
The sentence suggests that the team is about to win a baseball game. In such situations, the team would typically celebrate their impending victory. Celebration might involve high-fives, group hugs, cheers, and so on. Pride and recognition are less likely options, because the team may not necessarily be recognized or feel proud until after they have won. Joy is a possibility, but it is not specific enough to the context of a baseball game. Going home is an irrelevant option that does not make sense in the given sentence.
The sentence suggests that the couple decided to end their marriage, which is commonly referred to as getting a divorce. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as being lonely or arguing does not indicate a decision to end the marriage, legal fees do not make sense in the context, and pleasure does not relate to the topic of divorce.
In French cuisine, serving wine with dinner is a common practice and forms an important part of the dining experience. Wine complements the flavors of the food and helps to enhance the overall dining experience. The other options, such as Montreal, Quebec, Manhattan, and potpourri, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question nor are they typically served with dinner at a French restaurant.
The use of the word "knotted" suggests that there was an issue with her hair or something else that was flowing, and the solution was to put up the convertible's top. The phrase "next time" implies that this was a recurring event or something that she had experienced before. "Hold up" is the most appropriate phrase to describe the act of stopping or pausing briefly in order to address an issue, while the other options do not fit the context or meaning of the sentence. "Stagnate" and "stagnant" are similar in meaning and describe something that is not moving or progressing, but they do not relate to the specific scenario described in the sentence. "Unmoved" and "stopping" do not capture the meaning of addressing an issue, and are therefore less appropriate answers.
The question is asking about a common action associated with prayer. Talking to God is a common way that people pray, as prayer is often thought of as a way to communicate with a higher power. The other options may also be associated with prayer, but they do not directly address the question being asked.
The sentence suggests that writing can cause a negative physical effect before it is finished. Writer's cramp is a condition that causes pain and stiffness in the hand and wrist due to the repetitive motion of writing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking which state does not share a border with Colorado, so one can eliminate options that do border Colorado. Colorado does share borders with the United States (since it is located within the US), Texas, Mexico, and Nevada. New York is located in the northeastern part of the US and is far away from Colorado, so it does not share a border with the state.
To "entertain" someone typically means to engage with them in a fun or enjoyable way, such as by hosting them at a party or making them laugh with jokes or stories. Therefore, if someone entertains another person, it is likely that the other person will feel positively toward them. "Liked" is the best answer choice as it directly describes a positive feeling toward the person who is doing the entertaining. The other answer choices may also describe positive feelings, but they are not specifically connected to the activity of entertaining.
The sentence suggests that the doctor must obtain some form of training before practicing. Medical schools are institutions that specifically train individuals to become medical doctors, providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to practice medicine. The other options do not offer any form of medical training, making them unlikely answers.
The sentence indicates that the shopping center was lacking tenants, which suggests that they were looking for businesses to fill the space. The most likely option in the given choices is "stores" as it specifically refers to businesses. "People" is too general and could refer to customers, employees, or potential investors. "Most peculiar places" is an odd option that doesn't fit the context of the sentence. "Mall" is synonymous with shopping center and doesn't provide any additional information. "Suburbs" is irrelevant to the question, as it doesn't specify who the shopping center solicited.
Beans are known for causing gas and flatulence in some people due to a type of carbohydrate they contain called oligosaccharides. This is a commonly known result of eating beans and is referenced in popular culture and literature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence refers to a body part located on top of the neck, which is a clear indicator that the correct answer is "one head." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the laid off factory worker had a negative reaction to hearing about a changing society. Out of the given choices, anger, resentment, and depression can all be considered negative emotions. However, resentment specifically suggests a feeling of bitterness or indignation towards the situation, which seems to fit the context of the sentence better than anger or depression. "Make person sick" and acceptance do not match the tone of the sentence.
The question mentions a sunny, clear day, which suggests that the answer is not a location that would typically have rough or turbulent water. A bridge and waterfall are unlikely options as the water would be moving too fast or be rough. Planet earth and valley are too broad and do not provide any specific information. A mountainous area may have calm pools or slow-moving rivers, making it an ideal location for holding a cup upright to catch water on a sunny, clear day.
The sentence mentions that the spy was listening in on a conversation, which suggests that their purpose was to gather information. Gathering information is often a common objective for spies, as they seek to obtain intel on their targets. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and do not have any clear connection to spying.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about the role of light in illuminating the air. Light is often used to illuminate spaces or objects, and when it passes through the air, it can help to illuminate the surrounding area. The other options (beam, polarised, carry information, and age paper) do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not relevant answers.
The sentence suggests that the building is occupied on a specific day, the day after Saturday, which is commonly known as Sunday, and therefore could be a religious building. The mention of a basement also points towards a larger building, which could also support the idea of it being a church. The other options, such as a closet or own house, do not fit the criteria mentioned in the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the shopping bag is being used to carry items that have been purchased while out shopping. After shopping, one would typically take the bag home with them. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
While it is possible that some people may experience aggravation while reading the news, it is not a common behavior. Looking at pictures is also not a typical action people take while reading the newspaper, as most news articles are predominantly text-based. Eating breakfast and drinking coffee, on the other hand, are commonly associated with reading the newspaper as many people enjoy consuming breakfast items and hot beverages while perusing current events. Chugging milk is not a common behavior associated with reading the newspaper.
The phrase "see a story on the big screen" suggests that the question is asking about watching a movie. "Go to movies" is the only answer choice that directly relates to this idea, as it implies physically going to a movie theater to watch a film. The other choices, such as "visualize," "reading," "open book," and "sketching a picture," do not have any connection to watching a movie.
The sentence indicates that the food show focused on pizzas and traveled to different locations to visit a pizzeria each week. Therefore, the correct answer would be "different states". "Chicago", "Little Italy", and "New York" are all specific locations, but the sentence states that the show visited different places each week. "Friends house" does not relate to the context of the sentence, and "capital cities" is too general and not specific enough to the topic of pizzas.
The word "walk-in" suggests that the family got their food from a room or closet designated specifically for storing food, such as a pantry. A pantry is typically used to store non-perishable items like bread and chips, making this a likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well: a supermarket is a large store, a plastic bag would not be referred to as a "walk-in," a toaster is an appliance for cooking food rather than storing it, and a house is too general to provide a clear answer in this context.
The sentence implies that a president is a result of a process or event. Of the choices given, "election" is the most likely option since presidents are typically elected by the people they govern. "Board room" and "self-appointed" are not commonly associated with the selection of presidents and "trouble" is vague and not a valid option. While "government" may seem like a plausible answer, it is not specific enough to answer the question accurately.
After getting a divorce, a person's marital status changes from being married to being single. Therefore, the correct answer is "being single." The other options are not accurate descriptions of a person's relationship status after a divorce. "Children suffer" and "freedom" may be associated with divorce, but they do not relate to the question about relationship status. "Default setting" and "no spouse" are not commonly used phrases to describe a person's relationship status.
The sentence mentions Yooperland, which is a colloquial term for Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Additionally, the mention of train tracks suggests that the character is traveling within the state rather than to a different location like New York or Canada. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that having children wash dishes after dinner is a way to teach them responsibility. Washing dishes is a household chore that requires attention to detail, good time management, and the ability to work independently, making it a useful task for teaching responsibility. None of the other options have a clear connection to the concept of responsibility or household chores.
The sentence states that the person wants a dog that's easy to spot, which suggests that they are looking for a dog with a distinctive appearance. Among the given choices, "black" is the only option that can refer to a physical characteristic that is easily recognizable. The other choices ("blind", "fun", "alive", "playing dead") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Main streets are often the busiest areas in towns and cities where people gather to shop, eat, and socialize. By setting up on a main street, the dentist's office would be more visible to potential patients as they pass by on foot or in their cars. Corner stores and medical centers may also be good options for visibility, but the sentence specifically mentions wanting to stand out from other medical offices. Metropolitan cities would have high visibility, but there may be more competition and higher costs associated with such a location. Towns may not have as much foot traffic or visibility as main streets or metropolitan areas.
The items mentioned - macaroni, rice, and hamburger helper - are all food products typically found in a grocery store. The other options do not sell food products, making them unlikely choices for where John would be shopping for these items.
A needle is often used to draw blood or give injections, which could cause a drop of blood to fall. The other options, such as human body, vein, and person, are too general and do not provide a specific action or object that could cause a drop of blood to fall. A bite could cause bleeding, but it is not as common or specific as a needle in the context of the question.
When someone studies in a library, they often need to focus and pay attention to their work in order to be productive. This requires a level of concentration. The other choices are related to the act of studying in a library, but do not directly answer the question of what one is about to do when studying in a library.
A ribbon is commonly used as a decorative accessory in hair styling. Mothers often put ribbons on their daughters' hair to make them look more attractive or to keep their hair in place. The other options, such as a typewriter or floral arrangement, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Climbing a mountain involves ascending to higher elevations, which is the most logical answer to the question. The other choices may be potential outcomes of climbing a mountain, but they are not directly related to the act of climbing itself.
The word "soured" implies that something that was once good has now become unpleasant or undesirable. This suggests that James believed that the situation had declined or worsened in some way. The other options do not necessarily convey the sense of deterioration or worsening that is implied by the word "soured."
The question is asking for an alternative to an original painting that is more affordable. Reproduction is a term commonly used to describe a copy of a painting that is made by printing or copying the original artwork. The other options, such as derivative or simile, are not typically used to describe a copy or alternative to an original painting.
The sentence suggests that someone who is immoral may resort to unethical behavior during final exams, such as cheating. The option "study" is the opposite of what someone who didn't study would do. "Great joy" and "graduation" are not related to the context of the sentence, while "sweat" is a normal bodily response to stress and not necessarily indicative of immoral behavior.
The sentence suggests that Bob needs to replace his sunglasses quickly, which implies that he does not have time to search in large stores like department stores or look through his car. The most convenient option would be a drugstore, which typically sells a variety of inexpensive sunglasses and is likely to be located nearby. The other options listed do not offer a clear solution to Bob's problem of quickly getting new sunglasses.
Inflation refers to the increase in prices over time, which means that people need to spend more money to purchase the same goods and services. Therefore, when people are fighting inflation, they should stop spending more money and try to reduce their expenses. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Problems, economic instability, and deflation are not actions that people can do to fight inflation, while buying liquor may be a way to temporarily forget about the issue but not a solution to it.
The sentence suggests that driving is expensive for Bill due to the cost of gas. Therefore, the correct answer would be "using gas." The other options are not directly related to the expense of driving, such as deaths, traffic jams, and break down. "May die" is also not a logical answer as it is not related to the context of the sentence.
A dish cloth is commonly used in the kitchen to clean dishes and surfaces, so it makes sense to keep it where it is most accessible. The other options (laundry, linen closet, fabric store, bedroom) are not relevant as they do not have any connection to the use of a dish cloth in the home.
The sentence suggests that the waiter is performing a task that occurs between each customer, which could be setting the table for the next guests. Serving the meal and serving the food are tasks that are typically performed while the customers are present, while presenting the bill and taking the order are tasks performed at the beginning or end of the meal. Therefore, setting the table is the most likely answer.
The sentence suggests that the poor family does not have any decorations in December, which implies that they do not have a Christmas tree. A Christmas tree is a common decoration during the holiday season and is often the centerpiece of many homes' holiday décor. The other choices either do not have a clear connection to the context or do not address the issue of the family's lack of decorations during the holiday season.
The act of peeing involves emptying the bladder, so if a person has the urge to pee, it likely means their bladder is full. The other options do not accurately describe the state of the bladder in this context.
The word "ignorance" implies a lack of understanding or knowledge, and when this exists between groups, it can lead to conflict or hostility. This is a common theme in social psychology and intergroup relations research, which has shown that intergroup ignorance often leads to negative perceptions, stereotypes, and prejudice. The other options do not make logical sense in this context, as they do not reflect the negative consequences of intergroup ignorance.
The sentence suggests that playing games with children has a certain effect on them, and the key to choosing the correct answer is to identify what that effect might be. The other options are either inappropriate, negative, or do not fit the context of the sentence. The correct answer is "entertaining" because playing games with children is an activity that is designed to be fun and enjoyable for both the children and the adults involved. Playing games can help to stimulate their creativity, encourage socialization, and promote friendship and teamwork.
The sentence suggests that the person fishing did not catch any fish, which could imply that they were unsuccessful in their attempt to catch food. Therefore, "getting food" and "eating fish" are not likely answers. "Getting drunk" and "anger" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence either. The most reasonable option is that they would go home since they were not successful in their fishing trip.
The question specifically asks about where radio studios can be found. The most likely place for radio studios to be concentrated in one area is at a radio station, where multiple programs are broadcasted from a central location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence implies that the person was feeling cold and getting an extra blanket would hopefully help them become more comfortable. The phrase "more comfortable" directly relates to the action of getting an extra blanket, whereas the other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Were cold" is grammatically incorrect, "you're cold" is not a relevant option as it addresses the reader directly, and "less cold" and "feel comfortable" are opposite in meaning to the intended outcome.
Hunger is an indication that the body needs food for energy. Drinking water may hydrate the body but will not satisfy hunger. Cooking dinner or having lunch may not be feasible or necessary in the middle of the night. Eating a hamburger is a specific food choice and may not be available or appropriate for everyone. Having food is a general option that acknowledges the need to eat something to alleviate hunger.
The sentence implies that people engage in some activity to alleviate their boredom. Calling friends or learning from each other are both common ways people may choose to do this. Eating fish or dying of starvation do not relate to the context of the sentence, and while writing stories may be a potential activity, it is not mentioned as a specific option in the sentence.
The use of the past tense verb "used" indicates that the action of using the travel website to book flights has already taken place. The sentence suggests that the speaker has a regular habit of using this website in the past. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either refer to the present or have no clear connection to the action being described.
The word "reproducing" suggests that the farmer was breeding or producing more sheep. The question asks about what one particular sheep gave later, which implies that it gave birth to lambs. The choice "wool" is related to sheep, but does not fit the context of reproduction. "Fun" and "larger family" are unlikely outcomes of sheep reproduction, while "problems" is a negative option that is not supported by any context in the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person was "bound" for llano estacado, which means that it was his intended destination or end goal. The other options are possible nearby locations to llano estacado, but there is no clear indication that any of them are the end goal mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that someone is unable to reply to you, which indicates that they are unable to speak. The term "mute" specifically refers to someone who is unable to speak, while "deaf" refers to someone who is unable to hear. The other options, such as "send" and "email," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the people mentioned don't have insurance and are therefore seeking medical care at a place that is likely to have a long wait time. Clinics are often associated with longer wait times and take walk-ins without appointments, unlike private doctors who often require appointments and may have shorter wait times. Maternity wards are not typically walk-in clinics, and their services are highly specialized, while a dentist's office is also unlikely to be a walk-in clinic and provides specialized care for dental issues. A doctor's office could be a walk-in clinic but may also require appointments and offer a wider range of services than a typical clinic.
Pouring water over grounds is a common way to make coffee. Coffee grounds are typically placed in a filter or French press, and hot water is poured over them to extract the flavor. The other options are not related to making a drink using water and grounds.
The sentence suggests that the hair being referred to is that of humans, and the most common location for human hair is on a person's head. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. While mammals do have hair, including humans, the sentence specifies "human hair" and not "mammal hair." The options "legs" and "arm" may have hair, but this is not a characteristic commonly associated with those body parts. "Sink" is not a location for hair, but rather a place where hair might be removed or disposed of.
The sentence suggests that the dog's behavior was caused by an external factor. Antsy and restless behavior is often associated with discomfort, which may be caused by fleas. Fleas are a common parasite in dogs that can cause itching and discomfort, leading to restless behavior. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the library is accessible to people of any age, which is a common feature of libraries in educational institutions like schools and colleges. Libraries in houses are usually personal collections and not open to the public, while libraries downtown or inside buildings may have age restrictions or require membership to access.
The sentence suggests that the dog was in danger of getting hit by a car in the street, and the person yelled at the dog to do something to avoid that danger. "Come back" is the most appropriate choice because it implies returning to a safer location, while the other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Come here" and "being here" are not related to the danger and do not indicate a specific direction. "Home team" and "available" have no relation to the context at all.
The question implies that the person answering the questions is deliberately providing incorrect answers, which can be frustrating and annoying for the listener. The word "incorrectly" suggests that the person may be misleading or misleading the listener, leading to confusion and irritation. The other options do not accurately reflect the negative emotions that can arise from such a situation.
The sentence suggests that dreaming is something that happens during sleep, so the correct answer is likely to involve the process of falling asleep. Out of the options given, only "go to sleep" and "fall asleep" accurately describe the act of getting into a sleeping state. "Sleep peacefully" might be a helpful step towards having pleasant dreams, but it is not a prerequisite for dreaming itself. "Smoke pot" is not a necessary or advisable step for dreaming, and "set goals" is not related to the physical process of falling asleep.
The word "bazaar" is commonly associated with the Middle Eastern region, and Istanbul is known for its famous Grand Bazaar. While other regions on the list may have their own marketplaces or festivals, Istanbul is the most commonly associated with a famous bazaar.
The question suggests that the sloth mentioned only exists in the imagination or as a mental image. This implies that it would likely be seen in a picture book or other forms of illustrations. The other options, such as a bad dream, another place, universe or rainforest, do not have a direct association with seeing an imaginary sloth in your head.
The sentence suggests that going on vacation will evoke a certain emotion or feeling. The word "vacation" is often associated with taking a break from work or stress and relaxing, so it makes sense that the correct answer would be "relaxation." The other options do not align with the common associations of going on vacation, as overspending and staying there reflect more negative aspects, pie seems unrelated, and "pleasant thoughts" is too vague to be a clear choice.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to eat BBQ that is not at home. The options "backyard" and "neighbor's house" would not be suitable because they are both places where someone would typically have a BBQ meal at home. "Louisiana" is a state known for its BBQ, but it does not provide information on where to get a BBQ meal away from home. "Ribs" refers to a type of BBQ meat but does not offer any location information. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "restaurant" as it is a place one can go to get a BBQ meal away from home.
Storing personal knowledge in the head is the most practical and common way to do so. Unlike the other options provided that require physical storage, the human mind is capable of retaining vast amounts of information and knowledge. Encyclopedias and books may contain valuable information but require access to physical specimens. University education can provide knowledge, but it is ultimately up to the individual to store it in their head. A safe is only useful for storing physical items, not intangible knowledge.
The presence of guards checking IDs at the entryway suggests that the building is likely a secure location, such as an office building or government facility, rather than a department store or private residence. While it is possible that some high-end department stores may have security measures in place, this would be less common than in buildings and facilities where access control is a higher priority. The option about picking tomatoes from a garden is also unlikely since this activity would not typically require ID checks or security personnel.
The sentence suggests that the baby was able to hear his mom talking for months, which means that he was exposed to language during that time. Based on this, it is likely that the baby would have picked up some language skills and learned how to speak, making "learn to speak" the correct answer. The other options, such as "talk nonsense" or "talk rubbish," do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make sense given the situation. "Boy or girl" is also not a relevant option as it does not relate to the sentence at all.
The sentence suggests that there was a task or requirement that the staff needed to attend to before the party. While some of the other options may be activities that the staff could do, they do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Ocean," "studying," and "stay home" are too vague and have no clear connection to the sentence. "Celebrating birthday" may be an option, but it would not make sense for the staff to attend this before the party. Therefore, "meeting" is the most likely answer as it fits with the idea of needing to attend to a task before the party.
The sentence suggests that John is watching a performance from a high vantage point, which is commonly found in a theatre. The sentence also mentions rehearsed lines and an audience, which are both associated with theatrical performances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question describes a place that has a queen who is not an insect, implying that it is a monarchy with a female ruler. England is a well-known example of a country with a queen who is not an insect, as Queen Elizabeth II is the current reigning monarch. The other options - castle, bee hive, and palace - do not fit the description of a place with a female ruler who is not an insect.
The context of the sentence suggests that Johnny had a disease that prevented him from playing with friends, which implies that he was not healthy. His family's goal, therefore, would be for him to become healthy so that he could resume normal activities. "Wellness" is a related concept, but it does not specifically address Johnny's health status. "Passing around" and "infect" are not goals that anyone would desire in this context. "Cure" is a related goal, but it implies that there is a specific treatment for Johnny's disease, which may not be the case.
The sentence is asking about a type of bike that has an engine, which rules out options like lawnmower, bicycle and car, as they are not typically associated with engines. The correct answer, motorcycle, is a specific type of bike that is designed to be powered by an engine. The option automobile is a common type of vehicle, but it is not typically referred to as a bike.
The sentence indicates that the person has been driving for a long time, which is a tiring activity. The phrase "sick of driving" suggests that they may be feeling exhausted or fatigued, which is reflected in the choice "getting tired." The other options do not fit in the context of the sentence.
The question is framed as a hypothetical scenario, where the person asking the question imagines themselves as a snake. The phrase "go tempt people" suggests that the snake would be looking to deceive or mislead individuals. In this context, the Garden of Eden is a reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve, where a serpent tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, leading to their expulsion from the garden. Therefore, the most logical answer would be the Garden of Eden, as it is a well-known location associated with temptation and deception. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that people are on vacation and have access to a swimming pool that they can enjoy before bedtime. While it is possible to find swimming pools in other locations, such as fitness centers and schools, the context of the sentence implies that the swimming pool is located in a place where people stay during their holiday. A motel is a type of lodging commonly associated with vacation travelers and is therefore the best answer choice. California is a state and not a specific location, and "on the street" does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a modern farmer needs to possess business skills in order to manage finances and increase sales. This implies that the skills needed are similar to those of a business man. Harvesting is a specific task related to farming, but does not relate to managing finances or increasing sales. City dwellers and industrial businesses do not have any clear relation to farming. Farm land is a generic term for the land used in farming, but it does not provide any insight into the skills needed to manage finances and increase sales.
The question asks what happens when lovers want to show affection, which suggests a positive action. "Kiss each other" is the only option that fits this requirement. "Show disgust of each other" and "argue" are negative actions that would not be associated with showing affection. "Part ways" and "break up" suggest the end of a relationship, which is also not associated with showing affection.
The question is asking for a way to wet a washcloth without squatting down, implying that the person does not want to use a lower surface like a bathtub or floor. The kitchen is not necessarily a bad option, but it does not provide a specific solution to the problem. The linen closet and swimming pool are not related to the context of the question at all. This leaves the sink as the most likely and logical option for wetting a washcloth while standing upright.
The question is asking about the reason why someone would decide to go somewhere. Of the given options, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable answer as it directly answers the question. "Might drive car" is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear reason for deciding to go somewhere. "Stumbling down" and "boredom" are unlikely reasons for making a deliberate decision to go somewhere. "Have fun" could be a reason to go somewhere, but it is not general enough to be considered the correct answer.
When meeting people for the first time, it is customary to introduce yourself, providing your name and perhaps some basic information about who you are and what you do. This helps to establish a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, which the other options also suggest. However, smiling and saying a greeting are not sufficient on their own and may be perceived as insincere or awkward. Looking over could also be interpreted as rude or dismissive.
The phrase "bringing suit" refers to initiating a legal action, which often involves paying legal fees and other related expenses. Therefore, it would make sense that someone may be unable to bring suit if they are financially unable to cover the associated costs. The other options, such as "aggravation" or "randomness," do not provide an explanation as to why someone would be unable to bring suit.
The sentence mentions picking up one more thing off his list and filling his cart, which suggests that the person is in a store. Additionally, grabbing some coffee on the way to checking out is a common activity in grocery stores. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "dime store" suggests that the context is from a bygone era when such stores were more common. Additionally, the fact that the characters are wearing hats implies that the movie is set in a time period when hats were more commonly worn. Therefore, the most likely option is an old movie, which would have been filmed in a time when dime stores were still prevalent and hats were a common fashion accessory. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to the purpose of having multiple machines. Since machines are commonly used in manufacturing, the most likely reason for a manufacturer to have many machines is to produce products on a larger scale. The other options are not related to the context of manufacturing, and therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence implies that going to the opera would be uncomfortable due to a painful condition. The option "fall asleep" doesn't fit because falling asleep would not necessarily be painful. "Haircut" and "fresh" don't make sense in this context. "Relaxation" is the opposite of discomfort. Therefore, "headache" is the only option that connects with the idea of pain and would make going to the opera uncomfortable.
The sentence mentions "liquid food" which suggests that it can be stored in a container. The options "supermarket", "oven", and "plate" do not make sense as places to store liquid food. "Pantry" could be a possible option, but it is not specific enough as it is a general storage area in a house. "Jar" is the most appropriate option as it is a common container used to store liquids, such as sauces, jams, and pickles.
The sentence indicates that the speaker needs a balloon for decoration purposes, which is often associated with events such as birthday parties. Balloons are commonly used as decorations at parties, especially for children's birthday parties. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in the sentence is deciding to express their opinion about a written assignment that the students found unfair. The word "verbal" refers to spoken communication, which makes the most sense in this context. The other options do not accurately capture the mode of communication being used to express the person's opinion about the assignment.
The term "water run-off overflow" suggests that excess water is flowing out of a particular area, such as a street or building, after heavy rain or flooding. The most likely destination for this water is a sewer system, as it is designed to handle excess water and prevent flooding. The other options, such as bathroom, glass, drain, and behind the curtain, do not make sense in the context of water run-off overflow.
The sentence suggests that buying too much beer can have negative consequences that can lead to getting arrested. Intoxication and boredom are possible outcomes of drinking too much beer, but they do not necessarily involve legal consequences. Problems may be vague and not directly related to the act of buying beer. Pleasure is too positive and does not make sense in the context of negative consequences. Therefore, get arrested is the only reasonable choice.
A labyrinth is a specific type of maze-like structure that is designed for walking meditation or spiritual reflection. The other options (store, city, diary, bible) do not typically involve physical walking, with the exception of potentially walking through a city if sightseeing or exploring, but this is not explicitly stated in the question. Therefore, the correct answer must be the option that most clearly relates to physical movement or walking, which is labyrinth.
The sentence implies that the person is feeling excitement and a desire to leave the house. The best option to satisfy both of these conditions is to go somewhere else. The other choices do not necessarily involve leaving the house or may not provide the same level of excitement as going somewhere new. For example, expressing information or going to the gym may not fulfill the desire for adventure and novelty that is suggested in the sentence.
The phrase "wisely decided to cash in" suggests that the person made a smart decision to stop gambling and collect their winnings. The phrase "brought a smile of content" implies that the person was satisfied with their decision and felt content with their winnings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James and Jane were enjoying themselves, which typically results in positive emotions such as happiness. The options "stress relief" and "laughter" are also possible outcomes, but "may laugh" and "in hospital" seem irrelevant and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The name "Big Sky Excavation" suggests that the company operates in an area with a large sky, such as a wide open space. Montana, known as "Big Sky Country," is a state characterized by open landscapes and wide expanses of sky, making it the most likely location for a company with this name. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the company's name.
The question suggests that there may be a consequence of not being careful when setting a cup on a table. The most likely consequence would be spillage, as a cup that is not set down carefully could tip over and spill its contents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Joe enjoys skating and finds it calming and Zen. He is able to feel the wind while skating, which indicates that he is likely outdoors and on skates. The other options, such as increased heart rate, injury, might fall, run, and move fast, do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence or the idea of skating being calming and Zen.
The sentence is describing the pathway that food takes through the body, starting in the mouth and passing through the throat. The alimentary canal, which includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines, is the the pathway that food travels through the body during digestion. The other options are not related to the digestive system and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The other options listed do not typically sell pens, while an office supply store specifically specializes in selling writing instruments such as pens. Additionally, the context of the question suggests that the person is looking to purchase a pen for writing purposes, which further supports the idea that an office supply store would be the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the children are wearing uniforms and helmets, which are commonly associated with sports activities. Additionally, the verb "about to do" implies that the children are in the process of starting an activity, rather than throwing things or playing with toys. The other options do not fit the given context.
The sentence suggests that a chess set was left outside and is at risk of freezing, which is most likely to occur in a location with cold weather. Michigan is a state known for having cold winters, which may suggest it as a possible answer. A dorm or cupboard are enclosed spaces unlikely to be exposed to freezing temperatures. A toy store is an unlikely location for a chess set to be left outside. Snow is the most likely answer as it is a weather condition associated with cold temperatures and can freeze objects left outside.
The sentence suggests that clippers are used on women at a specific location. While barbershops are typically associated with men getting their hair cut, women may also go to a barbershop for a short haircut or shave. However, the term "salon" is more commonly used to refer to a place where males and females can get haircuts and other beauty treatments. The other options, such as pharmacy or bathroom cabinet, are not places where haircuts are typically performed.
The context of the sentence implies that we are talking about a commercial activity involving the capture of crabs, which is typically done using fishing boats. Tidepools are not large enough to support commercial crab fishing, and cruise ships and Seychelles are not related to crab fishing at all. Underpants is a humorous option that is clearly incorrect.
The sentence suggests that if the person were to experience a sudden illness, they should go somewhere. Nursing homes and elderly persons are not typically equipped to handle sudden illnesses, nor are buildings or the brain. A hospital, however, has the resources and healthcare professionals necessary to provide treatment for a sudden illness.
The sentence suggests that James was printing when the paper got jammed, and after fixing the issue, he had to clear something. It is likely that he had to clear the print queue, which is a list of printing tasks that are waiting to be completed. When a paper jam occurs, the printer may pause its operation and stop printing any additional documents until the issue is resolved. Once the problem is fixed, the printer may resume printing the remaining items in the queue, and James may need to clear the queue to ensure that his current print job is prioritized. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that this is a gender reveal party for a baby girl, and traditionally the color associated with females is pink. The sentence also specifically mentions that flower bouquets were colored in a certain way, which further supports this notion. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Ticket booths are commonly found at amusement parks where visitors purchase tickets or wristbands to ride attractions. Train stations and metro stations also have ticket booths, but their purpose is to purchase tickets for transportation rather than rides. Fairgrounds may have ticket booths for admission to the fair, but not specifically for rides. Museums usually have ticket booths for admission, but they do not have rides.
The context of the sentence suggests that if someone's favorite show is a comedy, they will likely find it funny and laugh. This is a common reaction to humorous content. The other options may not be relevant or appropriate in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person is preparing for a trip and has packed their toothpaste and brush along with their clothes. The appropriate item to store these belongings would be a suitcase, as it is a common travel accessory specifically designed for packing and transporting personal items. The other options, such as bathroom or drug store, are unrelated to the context of the sentence. Mouth and squirrel are also irrelevant and do not make logical sense as the answer.
Popcorn is a popular snack often associated with venues such as movie theaters, carnivals, and sports events. While some restaurants may serve popcorn, it is not typically found on their menus or offered as a common snack option. Therefore, it is unlikely that one would find popcorn in a restaurant.
The sentence suggests that the crab was separated from his fellow crabs while out in the sea, which implies that he was likely to be in a natural habitat where crabs gather. Tide pools are shallow, rocky pools filled with seawater that are home to many different sea creatures, including crabs. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a crab would not be found in a fish market or cooking pot, and a farm is located on land.
The sentence suggests that Billy was unable to achieve something despite his efforts to defeat John, and the context implies that this something is related to success in a competition or battle. The word "victory" is most closely associated with success in a competition or battle, and therefore the correct answer. The other options may be related to success in other contexts, but are not clearly indicated by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the discovery of the truth about her father had led to a specific emotional reaction. The word "discovering" suggests that she had been searching for this information, which implies some sort of emotional burden or uncertainty that may have been lifted when she found out the truth. The word "relief" connotes a lifting of this burden and is therefore the best match for the context of the sentence. The other options do not have a clear connection to the idea of discovering the truth.
Since the question refers to not having anything specifically designed to hold a dollar bill, it suggests that the individual may not have a wallet, billfold, or purse on them. Therefore, the next logical option would be to carry the dollar bill in their pocket. Additionally, pockets are a common and convenient place to store smaller items like loose change and bills. The bank option is unlikely since it is a financial institution and not a place to store physical currency.
The sentence mentions that the woman used a drawstring bag, which typically has a simple mechanism for closure, involving pulling a cord to close the opening. Therefore, it can be inferred that the woman wanted her belongings to be tied up securely in the bag, to prevent them from falling out or getting lost. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or do not offer a logical connection to drawstring bags.
The sentence specifies that the bald eagle is at the northern extreme of the continental United States, which narrows down the possible locations to states that are bordering Canada. Of the given choices, Maine is the state that is located furthest north and closest to the Canadian border, making it the most likely answer. The other options may be located in the United States, but they do not have the same geographical location as Maine.
The sentence suggests that the leaves are in a location where they may be a hazard to drivers or pedestrians. Out of the given choices, a street is the most likely place where leaves could cause an accident due to slipping or reduced visibility, particularly during wet or icy conditions. The other options do not have a clear connection to this context.
The sentence suggests that having a lot of food will cause a specific sensation in someone, which is most likely to be feeling full. This is a common sensation that people experience after consuming a large amount of food. The other options do not accurately reflect the sensation of having a lot of food, as feeling satisfied or having heavy food are not necessarily connected to the quantity of food consumed, becoming tired does not relate to food consumption, and digestion is a process rather than a sensation.
The sentence implies that John did not intend for the oil spill to occur, indicating that it was an accident. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Detestable" and "weird" are subjective opinions that do not relate to the cause of the oil spill. "Enabled" and "effusive" suggest intention or enthusiasm, which contradicts the idea that the incident was accidental.
Hiking is often considered a form of exercise, as it involves walking on varied terrain and can provide cardiovascular and muscular benefits. While it can also be a way to seek adventure and challenge oneself, the main reason many people choose to hike is for the physical activity it provides. "Walking" could be considered a possible answer, but it is more general and does not necessarily imply a specific purpose or motivation behind the activity. "Becoming tired" and "fatigue" are not reasons for hiking, but rather potential outcomes or challenges that may need to be overcome during the hike.
The sentence indicates that the person expected to get a job but did not receive an offer. The phrase "feel" implies an emotional response, and the options include different emotions that could be associated with this situation. "Let down" is the most appropriate answer as it indicates a feeling of disappointment or disillusionment when expectations are not met. The other options are unlikely to be associated with this situation - illness, for example, is a physical state rather than an emotion, while satisfaction and gratitude would not be appropriate responses to not getting a job offer. Fear also does not fit because there is no indication of what the person is afraid of.
The concept of knights originated in the Middle Ages, which was a period of European history from the 5th to the 15th century. Knights were warriors who were trained in combat and chivalry, and they were prominent figures in the feudal system of medieval Europe. The other options are not related to the historical context of knights, and only represent fictional or recreational contexts.
The sentence suggests that the fox's appearance was a regular occurrence in the area surrounding the cabin. The phrase "come out of the woods" implies that the fox lives in a natural environment, rather than a man-made one like a swimming pool or hen house. The term "habitat" refers to the natural environment in which an animal lives, which further supports the conclusion that the correct answer is "natural habitat." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
