The word "copulating" suggests sexual activity, which can result in pregnancy and the birth of babies. The word "finally" implies that something was achieved after a prolonged period of time, which is consistent with the idea of pregnancy and childbirth. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that flying in an airplane typically involves a significant distance of travel, which is commonly associated with going far. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking where it would be unlikely to find a card catalog, which is a system for organizing information or materials. While a library is a common location for a card catalog, a store, bank or kitchen are not. Therefore, the correct answer is "kitchen" as it is the only option that is not a logical place to have a card catalog. The repetition of "library" in the choices is likely a typo.
Horror movies are known for their ability to elicit fear and terror in viewers. Watching a horror movie can cause a person to feel scared, anxious, and uneasy, which may result in them being fearful. The other options do not align with the experience of watching a horror movie.
The sentence suggests that the adventures of a talking monkey can be found in a particular type of medium, such as a book or story. Out of the options, only the library and story book suggest a place where a child could learn about this type of story. The rain forest and tropical areas are geographic locations and the pet store is unlikely to have books about talking monkeys.
Centavos are a subunit of the Mexican peso currency, where 100 centavos equal one peso. The other options are currencies used in different countries and do not have any connection to centavos or the Mexican peso.
The sentence suggests that the mother is involved in her child's education and is ambitious for a leadership position in a group related to the school. The options "corporation," "whitehouse," and "board room" do not have any clear relation to education or the mother's goals for her child. "Church" could be a possibility, but "pta" is the most likely option since it is a parent-teacher association that is primarily focused on supporting and advocating for children's education.
In the context of the question, the word "fan" implies someone who is a spectator of a sport or team. Therefore, the correct answer should be related to a place where people can watch sports. The options "bathroom" and "hot room" are not applicable as they are not related to sports at all. While "football stadium" and "sports stadium" are related to sports, they are too specific and limit the possibilities of what a fan could watch. "Sporting event" is a more general option that encompasses a wide range of sports and events that fans could watch.
The sentence suggests that John attempted to pay with something other than paper money, and as a result, Billy did not make change for him despite a prior agreement to do so. The options "unpleasant," "tradition," "stagnation" do not make sense in this context, and "laptop" would not be a typical item used to make a payment. Therefore, "paper money" is the correct answer.
Footprints are typically formed by the pressure of a foot stepping on a surface, which creates an indentation or impression. The options "rug," "roof," and "surface of the moon" are unlikely to have footprints formed in them, as they are not typical walking surfaces. The option "surface of the earth" is too vague, as footprints could potentially be formed on a variety of surfaces on earth, but "ground" specifically refers to the surface level of the earth and is a common walking surface, making it the most likely correct answer.
The word "many" suggests that the location where soup can be purchased is a place where a variety of soup options are available. Out of the given choices, only supermarkets typically offer a wide range of soups for purchase. Cupboards and containers are places where soup may be stored, but not necessarily purchased. Gardens and jars are not typically associated with purchasing soup.
The phrase "cash in" suggests that the person has earned a lot of money for working overtime and double shifts. The sentence then goes on to say that he will celebrate and relax with something unhealthy, which rules out options like drinking coffee. "Binge drinking" is a common way for people to celebrate and let loose after a period of hard work, which is supported by the context of the sentence. The other options do not fit with the idea of celebrating and relaxing after working hard.
The sentence indicates that a person has made coffee using hot water and coffee grounds, which is typically consumed in a coffee cup. The other options do not make sense in the context of this sentence as it would be unusual or illogical to pour coffee into a whirlpool bath, a glass filled with a different beverage, or onto the surface of the earth.
The sentence suggests that eatery is being used as a synonym for another word. Out of the given choices, restaurant is the one that is associated with the act of eating. The other choices are not related to food or dining in any way.
The question is asking about the location of illness, which implies that the answer is related to the physical body. Illness can occur in various parts of the body, such as the respiratory, digestive, or cardiovascular system. The other options do not relate to the question or are not anatomical locations where illness typically occurs.
The sentence mentions that the traveler was used to a lack of diversity in the suburbs, implying that they were not accustomed to a wide variety of options. The word "shocked" suggests that they were surprised by the abundance of food options, which is represented by the term "plethora." The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as they either do not convey a sense of abundance or do not relate to food.
The context of the sentence suggests that the subject being discussed is a flying vehicle that is able to lift straight up. The options "electric motor," "jet engine," "train," and "rotator" do not fit this description. However, a helicopter is a flying vehicle that uses a rotor to generate lift and is known for being loud and moving a lot of air. Therefore, the correct answer is "helicopter."
The sentence suggests that the artist believed that creating art was not just about creating a mere picture, but about creating something that would provoke a strong emotional response in the viewer. This implies that the artist believed that art should have a deeper meaning than simply being aesthetically pleasing, and that it should convey a message or elicit a response. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the drive was difficult and challenging, which would require the driver to be alert and focused in order to navigate through the obstacles. The option "listen to radio" and "sleep" suggest a lack of focus and alertness, which would not be helpful in a challenging drive. "Get into vehicle" is not a relevant option as it is assumed that the driver is already in the vehicle. "Hole in one" is not a relevant option as it has no connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James was in a desert, which is an arid, dry region that typically does not have many trees or buildings. Therefore, it is unlikely that the birds were on a roof, in a forest, or in a countryside park. The only logical option is that the birds were in the air, specifically the sky, which is where birds typically fly.
The sentence suggests that the product received negative feedback from the public, but the expert still found something positive about it. The word "despite" indicates a contrast between the negative reviews and the expert's opinion. Out of the given choices, "adequate" is the most appropriate because it suggests that the product may not have been exceptional, but it was sufficient for the expert's needs. The other options, such as "first rate" or "sufficient," suggest a higher level of excellence that is not supported by the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that being on the water after an earthquake could be dangerous, indicating a potential for large waves. Tidal waves, also known as tsunamis, are often caused by earthquakes and can be very destructive when they hit shore. The other options, such as a steam room or crushed ice, do not make sense in this context and are not related to the potential dangers of being on the water after an earthquake.
The term "millennials" refers to the generation born between 1981 and 1996, who grew up in the era of the internet and technology. The sentence suggests that when they experience boredom, they tend to turn to the internet to entertain themselves, which is reflected in the option "surf net". The other options may also be ways to combat boredom, but they do not align as closely with the behavior of millennials in this context.
The sentence suggests that the IT guy needed to replace the paper in the printer. A ream is a common measurement for a bundle of printer paper, typically containing 500 sheets. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a process that occurs over time, and the most obvious option is the natural aging process. As people age, they experience physical changes that can include wrinkles, gray hair, and loss of mobility. The other options do not make sense in this context - using money, feeling cold, playing games, and believing in god are all potential activities or states of being, but they do not necessarily change over time.
The sentence suggests that the father was dissatisfied with his son's laziness, and that he wanted to encourage some sort of positive change. Among the options presented, hard work is the most directly opposite to laziness, and therefore the most logical answer. The other options could also be desirable traits, but they do not specifically address the son's laziness in the same way that hard work does.
The sentence suggests that the basement with children playing in it is located in a place that the reader has access to, since it uses the phrase "own house". The other options do not fit this description, as a closet is too small, an office building or church may not have a basement open to the public, and "downstairs" is too vague.
The sentence suggests that the person is leaving and needs to pack their belongings. Keeping a shirt in a drawer or on the floor would not be practical for packing. The dresser and closet options are possibilities, but the suitcase is the most logical answer as it's commonly used for packing clothes when traveling.
The question asks for the emotion that is furthest away from "unhappy." Therefore, we need to consider the opposite or most opposite emotions of unhappy. Emotions like "glad," "joyful," "happy," and "delighted" are all positive emotions and are therefore likely to be closer to happiness than unhappiness. Therefore, we can deduce that the correct answer is "unhappy," which is clearly the opposite of happiness.
The verb "socialize" means to interact and spend time with others in a social context. It is commonly used to describe spending time with friends and acquaintances. The other options do not accurately describe spending time with others in a social context. "Tell story" implies a more specific activity of sharing stories, while "go somewhere" could refer to any type of activity. "Wedding" is a specific event, not a general term for spending time with others, and "clean room" is a household chore unrelated to socializing.
The context of the question implies that the answer is referring to the natural habitat of a weasel, rather than an artificial or fictional environment. A weasel is a wild animal that is commonly found in outdoor environments such as forests, fields, and wetlands. The other options do not provide a realistic location where you could find a weasel.
The sentence suggests that taking a phone call will always result in something happening. Given that the options include regret, decisions, food, and car accidents, the most likely option is communication, as that is the most common outcome of a phone call. Regret, decisions, and food are all possible outcomes but are not guaranteed, while car accidents are an unlikely and negative outcome that is unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Good sex can result in a variety of outcomes depending on the individuals involved and their intentions. Orgasm is a commonly desired experience during sexual activity, as it can provide pleasure and release tension. Other potential outcomes include pregnancy or children, which may be intentional or unintentional depending on the use of contraception. The option "doom" is not a likely outcome of good sex, and "venereal disease" suggests a negative outcome that is not necessarily a result of good sex.
The sentence suggests that grooming oneself can lead to an increase in self-esteem, which can be linked to feelings of satisfaction. Feeling satisfied with oneself and one's appearance can contribute to a positive self-image and improved overall mental health. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James bought an iPod specifically to listen to music, implying that he would most likely use it in situations where he wants to listen to music, such as during a meeting, at the mall, at a concert, or at work. However, the fact that the iPod is described as 'delicate electronics' implies that it would not be suitable for use in water or other environments where it might be damaged. Therefore, the correct answer is "water."
The word "computer" usually refers to a desktop computer, which is a device used for work or personal use. A department store, school, space shuttle, or library may have computers available for use, but a job seeker would need their own desktop computer to complete job applications and resumes.
Bald eagles are known to prefer open areas near water, such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines, where they can easily hunt for fish. Open country would provide the eagle with ample space to fly and locate prey. While it's possible for bald eagles to live in other environments such as mountains or pine trees, open country is the most relevant answer based on the bird's habits and preferences. Wildlife refuges and specific locations like Colorado are not necessarily indicative of bald eagle habitats, making them less likely choices.
The sentence suggests that John's efforts were not able to prevent the computer from stopping working. "Crash" is a common term used to describe when a computer suddenly stops working due to a technical issue, which makes it the most likely answer. "Old equipment" could also be a possibility, but the sentence does not suggest that the computer stopped working due to its age, so it is less likely. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that eating too much lunch frequently can have negative consequences. Obesity is a known result of overeating and a diet high in calories, which would fit with the idea of eating too much lunch. The other options may also be associated with overeating, but are not specifically related to the question's focus on lunch.
The sentence suggests that Susan does not support the KKK's cause, which would make it unlikely that she would be sharing or exchanging ideas with them. Selling hotdogs and falling asleep are also unlikely given the context of attending a meeting. Therefore, the most likely reason for Susan to attend a KKK meeting would be to gather information, either for personal interest or for a journalistic or investigative purpose.
Fireplaces are typically found in indoor spaces where heating is necessary, such as homes or cabins. While a fireplace could technically be found in a desert area, it would be very unlikely as the desert is typically hot and does not require heating sources. The family room or living room are common areas within a home where a fireplace may be found.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker needs help with answering questions, which implies that they require more information or knowledge to do so. The most logical choice from the options is sharing information, which can provide the speaker with additional knowledge or perspectives on the topic at hand. Getting tired, better grade, interesting, and teaching do not seem relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was falling into a pile of broken glass, which is a dangerous situation that could potentially cause physical harm. Of the choices given, the term "lacerations" specifically refers to cuts or wounds, which would be a common fear in this scenario. The other options, such as "injury" or "being laughed at," do not specifically relate to the danger of broken glass.
Silk is a luxurious and high-quality fabric that is often used to make high-end clothing items such as dresses, blouses, and suits. Nightgowns may also be made from silk, but the sentence does not provide any context to suggest that this is the correct answer. Mulberry trees are the primary food source for silkworms, which produce silk, but this answer choice is not asking about the raw material used to make silk. Chinatown and bushes have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the slaves were working on a line or in a group, and that even if one died, the others were still forced to continue. This suggests that the slaves were likely doing physical labor, hence the answer is "working." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve physical labor or group work.
Wood is less dense than water because of its cellular and fibrous structure. This means that the amount of matter in a given volume of wood is less than that of an equal volume of water. This property also makes wood buoyant in water, allowing it to float. The other options, such as "good swimmer" or "gilded," are not related to the physical properties of wood in water.
The word "dodge ball" is commonly associated with a game in which players throw soft balls at each other while trying to avoid being hit. The other options do not make sense in relation to dodge balls. Children may hear music or watch TV as separate activities, but it is not directly related to dodge balls. While playing with toys and playing sports are both plausible options, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on a specific activity that involves throwing objects.
The sentence suggests that James had a strong emotional reaction to rock music, which is often associated with passion and intensity. The term "ardor" specifically means strong enthusiasm or passion, making it the most fitting choice out of the options given. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response typically associated with rock music.
Animals are mainly classified into three categories based on their diet - herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Herbivores primarily eat plants, while carnivores mainly feed on other animals. Omnivores eat both plants and animals. Therefore, out of the given options, plant is the most correct answer as it refers to the main food source of herbivores. The other options - human, cuddly pet, specific, and eat cake - are not relevant to the topic of animal diet.
The sentence suggests that the person is moving to a place that is not allowing their small dog, despite being advertised as pet friendly. The options "trailer park" and "grandmother's house" do not fit the context of the sentence. The option "basket" is not a place and seems to be included as a distractor. The option "Germany" may not have any relevance to the context of the sentence, so the correct answer is "apartment complex".
A faucet is typically used to dispense either hot or cold water that flows out from a source, such as a pipe or reservoir. The phrase "spring forth" suggests that the water coming out of the faucet is flowing freely and quickly, which is commonly associated with fresh water sources like natural springs. The other choices do not accurately describe the nature of water that comes from a faucet. Room temperature simply refers to the temperature of the water, while wet clothes and take several forms are not related to water sources. Hard water refers to water that has a high mineral content, which would not be an accurate attribute of all water that comes from a faucet.
The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to a symbolic or representative meaning of the bald eagle for America. The bald eagle is the national bird and serves as the national emblem of the United States, which represents freedom, strength, and majesty. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question aimed to become a famous actor or performer, which is commonly associated with moving to Hollywood. Hollywood is known as the center of the film and entertainment industry and attracts many aspiring actors and performers. The other choices, such as the solar system, constellation or night sky, are not relevant to the context and do not provide any clues to the correct answer. Theatre could be a possible choice; however, it does not specify which city or country the theatre is located in, making it an unlikely option.
The context suggests that the student is in a quiet classroom and has a piece of paper in front of them, indicating that they are likely taking a test. The other options do not fit the context of a quiet classroom or suggest that the student is actively working on something.
The sentence suggests that the father was trying to do something to alleviate the child's boredom. The word "goof" implies that he was being silly or playful, which is a common way to entertain young children. The other options - listening to music, playing chess, knitting sweaters, and meeting interesting people - do not seem related to the context of the sentence or the goal of entertaining the child.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person was looking at his report card, which typically indicates academic progress. Feeling pride after looking at a report card often indicates that the person has achieved good grades or passed their classes with flying colors. The other options, such as competing against someone or winning a prize, don't make sense in the context of the sentence, while "improve yourself" and "conquer opponent" are too general and could apply to many situations.
The sentence implies that there is a specific location where people feel most comfortable. "Own house" is the most logical answer because it is a place that people typically associate with safety, privacy, and familiarity. "Dance floor" and "compliments" might make people feel good, but they do not imply the same level of comfort as being in one's own house. "Headache" and "good things in life" are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence describes John as a bum, which implies that he may not have a permanent home. The sentence also suggests that he lives near a transportation infrastructure, which implies that he may rely on public transport to get around. The stereotype of a bum living near a train station is well-known, as it provides shelter and access to transportation. The other options may not be ideal living locations for someone without a home.
The word "job" implies that an individual is employed and working in a specific setting. This setting is typically referred to as a workplace, where individuals earn money by performing tasks or providing services. While it is possible to work from home or in a store, these options are not always referred to specifically as a "job." School and park are not commonly associated with paid employment opportunities.
The question is asking for a safe place to keep jewelry in a hotel room. A safe deposit box is a common option provided by many hotels for guests to store valuable items. A suitcase may be easily accessible to others, a vault is not typically available in a hotel room, and storing jewelry in a department store or hole in the ground is not practical.
The sentence implies that the person needs to obtain a night table in a legal manner. Typically, furniture stores are where people purchase furniture for their homes legally, while hotels and grocery stores do not typically sell furniture. Homes and hallways would not be applicable options for finding a new night table.
Flirting is often seen as a way of showing romantic interest in someone. Therefore, it makes sense that the most likely reason someone would begin flirting with another person would be because they are attracted to them. Curiosity, confusion, and getting into trouble do not have the same direct connection to flirting as attraction does. Being slapped would likely have the opposite effect and discourage someone from flirting.
Going on vacation usually requires some level of financial preparation. Saving money refers to setting aside funds in advance to cover the cost of the trip. Paying bills and having money may be important as well, but they are not necessarily the first step in vacation planning. Packing and having a reliable car are also important, but they are not as essential as having the necessary funds to pay for the trip.
The context suggests that John wants to buy writing supplies, such as a writing instrument and paperclips, which are commonly found in an office supply store. The other options, such as a desk drawer or purse, may contain these items, but they are not specific places where one would typically purchase them. A writer's hand is not a physical location where John can buy these supplies. A stationery store may have a wider selection of writing supplies as well, but an office supply store would still be the most common choice.
Family owned barber shops are often found in residential neighborhoods where they have established a loyal customer base. They are less likely to be found on busy commercial streets, like high streets, because the rent and overhead costs are typically much higher. Canada is a country and not a specific location where a barber shop would be found. Comb and wig stores are specialized shops that are not usually associated with barber shops.
The sentence suggests that the teacher was in need of paper clips, which she retrieves from a specific location. The sentence also provides a clue that this location can be opened, eliminating the options of "work," "university," "desktop," and "window." The correct answer, "drawer," is the only option left and is commonly used to store office supplies like paper clips.
The sentence suggests that the book in question is not needed for a while and should be stored nearby to fabric items you wear. This indicates that the book is likely related to fashion or textiles, and should be stored in a place where such items are also stored. The closet is the most likely option, as this is where people generally store their clothes and other items related to fashion or textiles. The desk, library of congress, classroom, and bookshelf do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that getting in shape has a positive impact on clothing. One way this may be true is that after losing weight or toning muscles, clothing may fit better and look more flattering. The other options are not directly related to the improvement of clothing after getting in shape.
The sentence suggests that rain can make something wet and dangerous, which is commonly associated with streets. When it rains, streets can become slick and slippery, increasing the risk of accidents for drivers and pedestrians. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A saw is a tool commonly used for cutting wood or other materials and would likely be found in a tool kit, toolbox, or tool shed where tools are kept. A hardware store may also sell saws, but it is not the most specific or likely option for the question. A bathroom has no clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking for an association with remembering. Nostalgia and pleasure are generally positive associations that may help with remembering pleasant memories, but they don't necessarily relate to familiarity. Sadness and depression may hinder remembering, particularly if associated with traumatic events. Knowledge, on the other hand, refers to familiarity with a subject or topic, which can aid in remembering details and information related to that subject.
The context of the sentence mentions the janitor climbing high up in the rafters of the auditorium, which indicates that they were likely working on something located above the stage. The word "replacing" suggests that the janitor was performing maintenance or repair work, and the most likely item that would need to be replaced in this context would be the lights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A dish is something typically used for serving or eating food, and the most common place to eat food is at a table. While dishes can be used for picnics, they are not exclusively used for this purpose, and a sink or kitchen cabinet are not places where dishes are used but rather where they are stored or cleaned. A pantry may also be used to store dishes, but again, it is not a place where they are used.
The question is asking about the negative aspect of farting that people dislike. The options 'social ostracism,' 'people laughing at,' and 'loud noise' could be possible negative consequences, but the main thing people dislike about farting is the bad smell it creates. The option 'flower smells' is not relevant to the context of the question and is not a common complaint about farting.
The sentence suggests that the counterweight is rising, which creates the potential for the elevator to move in the opposite direction. The word "descend" means to move downward or to lower oneself, which is the opposite of what the counterweight is doing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Park" implies that the elevator is stopping, "reduce" suggests that the elevator is decreasing in size or quantity, "fall" implies that the elevator is dropping suddenly, and "set" does not make sense in this context.
The sentence implies that standing in a queue means you have to wait for your turn, and there is nothing you can do about it. The option "will have to wait" is the only one that is directly related to waiting, while the others are unrelated or even inappropriate. "Become impatient" or "impatience" may be the result of waiting, but they do not describe what you do when standing in a queue. "Spit watermelon seeds at others" and "look around" are irrelevant and inappropriate actions.

The question suggests that eating a hamburger that is not cooked is likely to cause illness. This is because raw or undercooked meat can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli or salmonella that can cause food poisoning. The other options - being full, to fill the stomach, heartburn, and gas - do not relate to the specific cause of illness from eating undercooked meat.
The sentence suggests that the people were enjoying the music, which indicates that the music was likely pleasant and enjoyable to listen to. The other options do not necessarily convey a positive or negative connotation, nor do they provide any clear context clues from the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the object in question is small enough to fit in a pocket, and specifically mentions a man, which implies that it is an item typically associated with masculine clothing. Sunglasses are commonly worn by both men and women, but the option "shirt pocket" may be less likely since it can easily fall out or get lost, and "purse" is typically associated with women's accessories. "Drugstore" and "bag" are not relevant to the context.
Ticket offices that offer different types of tickets, such as for different modes of transportation or events, are commonly found in train stations. Movie theaters and opera houses usually only have one type of ticket office for their respective events. Cities and humans do not have ticket offices as they are not physical locations, and it is unclear what is meant by "different types" in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is discussing the use of window cleaner on their computer screen, which implies that the correct answer must be something related to computers. The choices "theatre," "movies," "drive-in movie," and "closet" have no clear connection to computers, so the correct answer must be "monitor," which is a piece of computer hardware that displays the images on the screen.
The question suggests that your friend needs help with moving, which is a situation where they need physical assistance. Therefore, the best option would be to offer your help. Relying on someone else or writing a letter are not appropriate responses in this situation. Pretending to be busy is dishonest, and promising to help is not necessary as it is implied in the question that your friend needs help and you are available to assist.
A comb is a tool commonly used in hair care and styling. While it is possible for individuals to keep a comb in their medicine cabinet, trashcan, suitcase, or pocket, these locations are less likely to be associated with the regular use of a comb. Barber shops, on the other hand, are known for using combs to style and cut hair. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "barber shop".
Board games are generally stored on shelves when not in use. However, they may also be stored in closets or other storage spaces. The den and the house are not specific enough to indicate where the board game would be stored. The toy store is a retail store where games are purchased, not stored.
The sentence implies that the person had some sort of knowledge or information to share with someone else. Teaching is a natural way to transfer information and help someone else learn. The other options do not relate to sharing knowledge or information, and therefore are not correct.
The question is asking what else is needed besides research materials when finding information. The options "internet," "ask questions," "searching for," and "logic" all relate to the process of researching, but only "time" refers to the additional resource needed. Researching for information takes up time which cannot be compensated by the other options.
The question asks for a location where a head would not move. In a hat shop, the head is typically a mannequin or a hat stand, which are stationary objects used to display hats. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - a submarine, human body, morgue, and movie theater do not have any clear connection to the concept of a stationary head.
Unhealthy lunches are often high in calories, sugar, and fat, which can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of developing conditions like obesity and heartburn. Becoming tired can also be a result of consuming a high-carbohydrate meal or one that is lacking in protein, but it is not necessarily a common outcome of an unhealthy lunch. Spending money may be a consequence of eating out or buying convenience foods, but it is not directly related to the health effects of the meal.
The sentence mentions "spirits," which refers to alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, gin, and vodka. In order to serve spirits appropriately, a restaurant would likely require a brewery, which is a facility that produces and stores alcoholic beverages. A kitchen cupboard is not adequate for storing and serving alcoholic beverages, and ghosts and a chemistry lab are not related to the production and serving of spirits.
The context suggests that the location where bread is being found is unusual or unexpected. Bread is commonly found and consumed during mealtimes such as dinner, and can easily be purchased at a supermarket. It is also stored in the refrigerator or bread box at home. Jail may be a less common location to find bread, but it is still a plausible option for prisoners to receive bread as part of their meals. However, finding bread in a car is not a typical or expected location for it to be stored or consumed.
The sentence implies that the person injured themselves while working and their coworker suggested they do something to prevent further injury or to recover from the injury. One common suggestion in such a situation is to take a break or a vacation. The other options are not relevant to the context and do not offer a solution to the problem presented in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was looking to purchase a new computer system. The most likely place to buy a computer in person would be a computer store, as opposed to an online purchase. The other options, such as "place" and "human body," do not make sense in the context of purchasing a new computer system. "Computer science" is not a place to purchase a computer, but rather a field of study related to computing.
The sentence suggests that the filming location was recognizable to the audience, which implies that it was a popular or frequently used location. New York is a well-known city for film and television production, and many iconic scenes have been filmed there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man wanted to improve his communication skills before a large event because he was new to the city. It also implies that he wanted to use these skills to connect with people. Making friends is the most logical choice among the options given because it directly relates to the man's desire to communicate effectively and connect with others. The other options may be related to communication, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as making friends.
A post office is a place where people can buy stamps and send mail. The other options do not commonly have mailboxes or sell stamps. A front yard might have a mailbox, but it would not sell stamps. A street corner, school, or apartment complex are also unlikely places to find a mailbox or to buy stamps.
The sentence suggests that the siblings continued to have children with their partners, which would result in an increase in the size of the family. The phrase "reproducing with their husbands and wives" indicates that they were having children within the context of marriage, rather than outside of it, which implies a focus on building a larger family unit. The other options (problems, fun, birth, offspring) do not necessarily follow logically from the sentence.
Smelting is a process of extracting metal from its ore through heating and melting. This implies that the mineral being talked about must be an ore that contains the metal to be extracted. Therefore, the correct answer is ore. The other options are not commonly associated with the extraction of metals.
The sentence implies that the use of an air conditioner is more common in a specific area. The option "south" is the most appropriate answer because it is known that temperatures are higher in the southern regions of the United States, where air conditioning is often necessary to keep indoor spaces cool and comfortable. The other options do not provide any contextual clues or logical connections to the sentence.
Marmosets are a type of monkey that are typically found in the rainforest. Rainforests provide plenty of trees and vegetation for marmosets to climb and hide in, as well as a diverse range of plant and animal life to forage for food. Other options like wilderness, mountains, swamp, and burrow do not provide the same level of safety and resources for marmosets as the rainforest.
The question is asking for a place where a television can be stored and hidden, which suggests that the answer is a piece of furniture or location that can conceal the television. Options like apartment, living room, bedroom, and kitchen are rooms in a house or types of residences, and are not specific enough to answer the question. Cabinet, on the other hand, is a piece of furniture that can be closed to hide the television, making it the correct answer.
Peek-a-boo is a game commonly played with babies and young children, and it typically involves hiding and then revealing oneself to the child. When the child is surprised by the reveal, they often respond with laughter. Therefore, choosing "laughter" as the answer makes the most sense based on the context of the question and the common reactions of babies during this game. The other options do not accurately reflect the typical response of a baby playing peek-a-boo.
The use of the word "ground" in the sentence suggests that Sam was not on the ground himself, but was communicating with people on the ground through a radio. This is a common procedure for astronauts on a space shuttle, who need to communicate with mission control on the ground. The other options (school, shop, bedroom, train) do not fit the context of the sentence and do not involve the need for radio communication with people on the ground.
The question asks for a method to give ice a desired shape. Out of the given choices, melted and sculptured involve altering the physical state of the ice whereas carved and shaped involve manipulating the ice to create a particular form. Antarctica is not a relevant option as it does not provide any information on how to shape ice. Amongst carved and shaped, shaped is the more general term that can be used to describe techniques like carving or molding that are used to give ice a specific shape. Therefore, shaped is the most appropriate answer.
Jumping rope is a physical activity that requires movement and can increase heart rate, making it a good choice for those who want to be more active. Becoming tired and sweating may also be effects of jumping rope, but those are not necessarily the desired outcomes. Being happy and having a sense of rhythm may be personal feelings or experiences associated with jumping rope, but they are not universal outcomes associated with the activity.
Mold is a common problem in areas that are damp and have poor ventilation. Carpets, especially those in basements or bathrooms, can absorb moisture and provide a breeding ground for mold. Mold can release spores that can cause allergies and other health problems, as well as emit an unpleasant odor. The other options are less likely to be affected by mold and may not contribute to a smelly room.
Tickling is a sensation that can cause someone to laugh or giggle. The sentence suggests that a person tickling someone else is aware that they are getting close to a very ticklish spot when they hear a certain sound, and that sound is most likely associated with the tickling sensation. Nausea and yelling are not commonly associated with tickling, while itchiness would not produce the sound described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah filled something with peanuts, which is a food item commonly stored in jars. Jars have tight-fitting lids that help to keep the contents fresh, which makes them a popular container for food items like peanuts. The other options (ballpark, box, container, carnival) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the store is in sight, which indicates that the person can physically see the store. In order to reach it, the person would need to physically move towards it, which entails crossing a road or some other barrier that separates them from the store. The other options, such as "drink coffee", "dream dreams", or "think critically", do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the trend in question was unusual or strange, but that it had become accepted or popular. The phrase "the new thing to do" typically refers to a trend or activity that has gained popularity or become fashionable. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence, which implies that the trend was once uncommon but is now widely accepted.
The word "awakening" suggests that the person was asleep before and suddenly woke up, which can be uncomfortable for some people, especially if they were in a deep or restful sleep. This discomfort may manifest in physical or psychological symptoms such as muscle soreness, headaches or a feeling of grogginess upon waking. While the other options may be possible reactions to waking up in the middle of the night, discomfort is the most likely based on the context of the question.
The sentence implies that there is a common word that people use to describe puppies. While options like "soft" and "kennel" may be associated with puppies, they do not specifically describe the puppies themselves. "Very cute" also seems redundant with "cute" as an option, and "one choice for pet" is too specific and doesn't match the question. "Cute" is a common descriptor for puppies because of their adorable and playful nature.
The use of the word "stored" suggests that the question is asking about where one can keep an old refrigerator when it is not in use. The option "garage" is the most logical answer because it is a common place for people to store items that are not frequently used. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The question asks why young people like to drive a car, suggesting that there is an element of enjoyment or pleasure associated with this activity. The option "have fun" aligns with this idea and is a commonly cited reason for why people enjoy driving. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - cooking food is not related to driving, listening to the radio and concentrating are things that can be done while driving but do not explain why young people specifically enjoy it, and changing gears is a technical aspect of driving but not necessarily a reason why people enjoy it.
The sentence suggests that in order to remember facts for a test, one must engage in a specific study technique. The option "memorize" directly corresponds to this need, as memorization involves committing information to memory through repetition and recall. The other options - "not forget," "know," "concentrate," and especially "fry up badger fillets" - do not accurately describe a study technique that is likely to help someone remember information.
The sentence implies that in order to run after a ball quickly, you need to have the physical attribute of being able to run fast, which is typically associated with having legs. The other options either do not make sense in the context of running after a ball (e.g. "look first") or are not related to physical ability (e.g. "obese").
Listening to someone play the violin can be a relaxing experience because of the soothing and melodic sound produced by the instrument. Violin music is often associated with classical music, which is known for its calming effects on the mind and body. The options "magic," "sadness," and "loud noises" do not describe the typical experience of listening to a violin, while "making music" is a vague option that could apply to any musical instrument.
The sentence implies that parents encourage their kids to do something productive when they experience boredom. Reading a book is often seen as a productive and engaging activity, making it a likely answer choice. Traveling, sleeping, and playing chess may not be practical solutions for a child experiencing boredom, while "falling down" is clearly not a logical or appropriate suggestion.
Alcohol affects the central nervous system and can impair a person's balance, coordination, and motor skills. When someone gets drunk, they may struggle to walk in a straight line or maintain their balance, leading to stumbling or swaying. The other options, such as passing out or fever, may also be associated with excessive drinking, but they don't explain why someone wouldn't be able to walk in a line specifically.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for something that is both sweet and healthy. In this context, the only option that makes sense is "eat fruit," as it is a well-known fact that fruit is a natural source of sweetness and is also considered a healthy food option. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James is seeking truth because he has unanswered questions that are causing him to feel weighed down. Learning would provide him with further knowledge and potentially help him resolve these questions, indicating that "further knowledge" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "lies" or "matters to," do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Free mind" and "work to advantage" are not necessarily inaccurate, but they do not directly relate to James' desire for knowledge.
The sentence suggests that the place in question is a temporary sleeping arrangement away from home. The word "kitchenette" implies a small kitchen, which is commonly found in hotel rooms for guests to prepare simple meals. The other options, such as house or apartment, are more permanent living arrangements and wouldn't typically have a kitchenette in the sleeping area. Allen key is a tool and not a place. Dormrooms may have communal kitchens, but not necessarily kitchenettes in the sleeping area.
The sentence suggests that the hare was overconfident and the tortoise was able to win the race despite moving at a slower pace. The correct answer, "slowly," aligns with this context and is the opposite of "fast," which was used to describe the hare. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that Joe is doing something with a cup after Bill asked him to do something with it. The phrase "set on the table" suggests that Joe is placing the cup on the surface. "Put down" is the most fitting phrase that describes this action. The other options are not related or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for an example of a religious practice, and attending church and praying are commonly associated with religion. Religiosity refers to the degree of devotion or religiousness that an individual exhibits, and attending church and praying are both activities that demonstrate a high level of religiosity. The other options do not have any clear connection to religious practices.
Trading using money is a common practice in modern economies. Money is a medium of exchange that is widely accepted, and it allows people to trade for goods and services without the need for bartering or exchanging other goods or services. The other options do not make sense in the context of trading for goods and services.
Schools often have organized lines for activities such as lining up to enter the classroom, lining up for lunch, and lining up for recess. The other options do not have any clear connection to children lining up with other children in an organized manner.
Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it increases urine production and can lead to more frequent urination. Therefore, it is common to go to the bathroom after drinking alcohol in order to relieve the body of excess fluids. The other options may also be associated with drinking alcohol, but they do not provide a physiological explanation for why someone may need to use the bathroom.
Winning a game is typically associated with feeling satisfied and accomplished, as opposed to feelings of disappointment or tiredness. Injuries are not typically a result of winning a game, and competitiveness is more of a mindset than a direct consequence of winning.
The sentence suggests that the bird is not yet capable of flight, but is in the process of developing this ability because it is still nesting. Therefore, the correct answer is "learn to fly." The other options are not likely to happen soon because they require the bird to have already mastered the art of flying.
The sentence suggests that the subject of focus is related to Asian restaurants and how food is eaten there. In many Asian countries, it is common to eat food using a bowl and a spoon or chopsticks. The other options are not typically associated with how Asian cuisine is traditionally consumed.
The question is asking about the closest place to eat, suggesting that the options should be related to food. "Serving drinks" is not enough to fulfill the requirement of a place to eat. "Shopping center" is too general and may not necessarily have food options. "Own house" is not a viable option for someone who is not currently at home. "Downtown" may have restaurants but is not specific enough to be considered the closest place to eat. "Food court" is the most appropriate option as it is a designated area specifically for multiple food options.
The sentence suggests that John was hypnotized by the lips, which implies that they were part of a larger human face. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "stay put" is commonly used to describe someone who does not want to move from their current location or situation. It implies a sense of resistance to change or a desire to maintain the status quo. The other options, such as "sit still" and "standing still" do not have the same connotation and do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence suggests that the two people were engaged in a playful activity, which is commonly associated with "playing around." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Making things and constructing imply a more focused and goal-oriented activity, while hug and kiss are not related to wrestling or playing around.
The sentence suggests that the woman was trying to protect her ring from getting wet while she was in a bath tub. The phrase "get it wet" implies that water may damage the ring, which is a common concern for jewelry. The other options do not provide any context for why the woman would need to remove her ring.
The context of the question suggests that the answer should be an action that is typically associated with a physical altercation or argument. "Get angry" is a common response when people are in a conflict, as emotions are heightened and tempers can flare. The other options do not fit with the context of the question, as "facing each other" and "gather together" could apply to friendly interactions, while "kiss" and "learn from each other" do not typically apply to fights.
Insects are known for having the ability to jump long distances through the air using their powerful leg muscles. While some insects may jump through fields or over logs, none of the other options would make sense in this context. Insects cannot jump through solid objects like rocks, and they do not typically jump through bodies of water. Therefore, the correct answer is air.
The sentence suggests that the cause of a problem is too many people driving, which is commonly associated with traffic congestion or "traffic jams." Transportation and freeway may be related, but they do not explain the result of too many people driving, which is congestion. Traffic accidents are also a problem related to driving, but they are not mentioned in the sentence as a result of too many people driving. Moving is not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the action the individuals referred to happened before their first kiss, which makes options like "embrace" and "asking questions" unlikely. The phrase "at first sight" indicates that they fell in love immediately upon seeing each other, ruling out options like "smile." This leaves us with the correct answer "falling in love."
The question is asking about where a child can get a wagon, which suggests that it is a toy or plaything. The options "field," "garage," and "backyard" are locations where a wagon might be found, but they are not places where a child could obtain a new one. "Bookstore" is also unlikely as bookstores usually sell books and not toys. "Toy store" is the most appropriate option as it is a place where a child can buy a new wagon.
The sentence implies that the director's cameras have moved and the extra is now standing in the way of the shot. Asking the extra to step out of or move away from the scene would have been a more obvious choice in this situation, which rules out those options. "Sit down" and "get off" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, "have moved" is the correct answer as it fits with the information provided.

This answer is supported by common knowledge and experience. It is widely recognized that guns, when in the wrong hands, can be very dangerous and deadly to others. While the other answers may also be true in some cases, they do not fully explain why guns are not allowed in certain areas.
The question is asking about the location of human residence, which would be on Earth. China and dress shop are specific locations, and train wreck is not relevant to the question. Homes are a possible answer, but "almost all" humans live in homes, so it is not a distinctive enough answer.
Heart problems can range from mild palpitations (an irregular or fast heartbeat) to life-threatening conditions such as heart attack, heart failure, or arrhythmia. In the worst cases, a serious heart problem can lead to death. While perspiration and getting old are not necessarily symptoms of heart problems, they may be associated with certain conditions or lifestyle factors that can increase the risk of heart disease. Therefore, it's important to seek medical attention if you experience any unusual symptoms or concerns about your heart health.
When a train leaves the station, it typically begins to accelerate, increasing in speed until it reaches its desired velocity. Opening doors is typically done at the station before departing, arriving late would not be a direct result of leaving the station, and decelerating or braking would only occur when the train needs to stop or slow down, which is not the case when leaving the station.
The word "secular" suggests a focus on the present life and material world, rather than on religious or spiritual beliefs about an afterlife. Therefore, a life that is not acknowledged in the secular world likely refers to a belief in an eternal life or an afterlife that extends beyond this physical existence. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the solution is becoming warmer, which indicates that heat is being added to it. The expected consequence of adding heat to a substance is an increase in temperature. Pleasure, global warming, starting a fire, and feeling comfortable do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not expected consequences of adding heat to a solution.
The sentence suggests that Billy eats cheeseburgers, but not always. He eats them more often than some people but less often than others, indicating that he eats cheeseburgers occasionally. The other answer choices all suggest that Billy rarely or never eats cheeseburgers with cheese, which would be contradictory to the information provided in the sentence.
The two conglomerates reached a tentative agreement, which suggests that they are discussing some sort of business deal or partnership. The other options do not make sense in this context- "accomplish" and "make progress" are too general, "stop arguing" does not seem like something that would be a goal of a business negotiation, and "digging holes" is irrelevant.
Dust is commonly found on surfaces that are closer to the ground, such as floors and low-lying furniture. It is less likely to accumulate in higher areas like attics or on windowsills unless they are located near sources that generate a lot of dust (such as a busy street or construction site). While dust can accumulate on carpets, it is less likely to be found underneath them unless the carpet has been in place for a long time without being cleaned. Closets may collect some dust, but they are not as likely to be a primary source.
The phrase "physical world" refers to the tangible, visible universe that can be directly observed and measured. The question asks what the world is made out of, so the most appropriate answer is the physical substances that make up the Earth, such as rocks, water, and air. The other options, such as fabric stores, ideas, and science labs, do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence and do not provide a plausible explanation for what the world is made of.
The sentence suggests that the person is afraid of dropping or losing hold of the cup due to their shaking hands. "Letting go of" is the clearest option that matches this context. "Breaking" and "bend over" are not relevant to the sentence, and "careful" and "pick up" do not accurately reflect the fear expressed in the sentence.
Movie theaters are known for selling popcorn as a popular snack choice for moviegoers. Popcorn is a crunchy and easy-to-eat snack that can be enjoyed while watching a movie. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that if the payroll tax amount is too high, the IRS will provide some form of compensation. A refund is a common way that the IRS returns excess payments to taxpayers. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a discount implies a reduction in the tax owed, income and spend are not related to tax payments, and a credit would only be applicable if the taxpayer had overpaid in a previous period.
The context of the sentence suggests that the purpose of attending a self-help lecture is to improve oneself in some way. Going to sleep would not be the intended purpose of attending. Gaining happiness could be a possible goal, but it is more likely that attending a self-help lecture would be focused on gaining knowledge and inspiration to improve one's life or situation. Therefore, the correct answer is gaining knowledge/inspiration.
The question is asking for a descriptor of someone who creates art. The word "artist" directly refers to someone who creates art, so it is the correct answer. The other options do not fit the context of the question or provide a descriptor of someone who creates art. "Inspired" may describe the creative process, but it does not describe the person. "Be mean" is irrelevant and negative. "Starve" may relate to the stereotype of starving artists, but does not describe the person themselves. "Imagine" may describe the creative process, but does not describe the person specifically.
The sentence suggests that the person was trying to say something smooth and impressive, but was struggling to speak clearly. This indicates that they were likely stumbling over their words, which is commonly associated with stuttering or mumbling. The other options, such as being speechless or striking out, do not fit the context of someone trying to come up with a pick-up line and struggling to express themselves verbally.
The sentence suggests that the emotional reaction of a person when their friends abandon them is being asked for. To be "let down" means to feel disappointed or betrayed, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not relate to the emotional reaction of being abandoned by friends.
Plumbing is typically associated with the water supply and waste removal systems in a house, which are most commonly found in the bathroom. This includes pipes for sinks, showers, toilets, and possibly a bathtub. While plumbing may also be present in other areas of the house, such as the kitchen or laundry room, the bathroom is the location where most plumbing is concentrated.
The sentence suggests that taping a television show is done for the purpose of watching it again, which is the same as "re-watching" or "watch again." The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence - "see again" and "reconsider" imply a more critical or evaluative approach, while "enjoyed" and "found interesting" describe a positive reaction to the show, but do not address the act of watching it again.
The sentence implies that drinking alcohol while being in a couple leads to a specific outcome, which must be understood to select the correct answer. While alcohol can lead to negative outcomes like sickness and disorientation, they are not specific to being in a relationship. Having children and death are not directly related to drinking alcohol while in a couple. However, it is commonly believed that drinking alcohol can lead to increased sexual activity, which explains why having sex is the correct answer.
A large dog might live in a guard house because guard dogs are often used to protect a property or establishment. Guard houses are small buildings that provide shelter for security personnel and their dogs. The other options do not make sense in the context of where a large dog might live.
The sentence suggests that the bundle was not tight enough, which caused some contents to fall out. The word "loose" is the opposite of "tight" and is the most logical choice. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not contradict the idea of the bundle not being tight enough.
The sentence implies that the reason someone may check up on someone else while they are working is due to a feeling of isolation. When someone is isolated, they may feel lonely or disconnected from others, which can cause them to seek out interaction or reassurance. Schizophrenia and mistrust relate more to a sense of paranoia or distrust, while annoying and executed are not relevant to the given context.
The sentence suggests that the people being referred to have an excessive desire for something. The use of the word "pathological" indicates that this desire may be abnormal or unhealthy. The other options do not accurately reflect this context, as they do not suggest an excessive or unhealthy desire. "Possessing more" is the most closely related option, as it implies a desire to accumulate or acquire more possessions.
The sentence states that cats mark their territories, which is typically done by excreting urine or spraying a pheromone. The options "eat meat," "have cancer," "cross roads," and "meows" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated as possible answers.

The sentence suggests that waiting for traffic for a long time might lead to a negative consequence when arriving at work. Among the choices, "being late" is the only option that represents a negative consequence. The other choices ("lengthy," "have time to think," "time-consuming," and "boredom") do not necessarily suggest a negative outcome.
Bleachers are commonly found at sporting events and are used as a seating arrangement for spectators to watch the game or match. They are typically made of long rows of benches without any backs and are arranged in tiers for better visibility. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence specifies that the soccer field is at a school, which implies that it is likely located within the school's premises or adjacent to it. Among the given choices, only "school yard" fits this description. The other options, such as "countryside" or "park," do not correspond to the context given in the sentence, which is focused on the location of the soccer field.
Ranches are typically associated with horses and other farm animals. As such, it is likely that children would enjoy interacting with the horses in some way. While petting the horses is possible, riding them is a more active and exciting activity that is commonly associated with ranches. Playing games and learning together are possible activities that could happen on a ranch, but they are not specifically tied to the context of ranches and horses. Watching TV is unlikely to be something that children would typically do on a ranch.
The sentence suggests that Danny enjoyed the show and used a religious term ("divine") to describe it. Lila disagreed with Danny's assessment, but she did not use the term "bad" to describe it. Instead, she thought the show was "undivine," which could suggest that it did not live up to Danny's religious associations with the word "divine." The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to Danny's use of a religious term to describe the show.
The sentence suggests that using the wrong words in a language can lead to misunderstandings, or the misinterpretation of what is being communicated between two or more people. Frustration and headaches may also occur as a result of this, but are not directly connected to the idea of misusing words. Problems and nausea are also not directly relevant to the context of the sentence.
The mention of workers passing through a lobby suggests a professional or business setting, which is commonly associated with office buildings. Opera buildings do not typically have workers passing through lobbies, while hotels often have guests instead of workers. A receptionist is a position within a building, not the building itself. A business plan is a document, not a physical location.
The verb "stockpile" means to gather and store a large quantity of something, especially in preparation for a shortage or difficult times. In the context of weapons, it is commonly used to refer to the act of collecting and storing weapons for future use or for security purposes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of gathering weapons.
The sentence suggests that the effort made by the person was not successful and was surpassed by a better solution. Therefore, the result of his effort was insignificant or unimportant in the end. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Innovative" suggests that the solution was groundbreaking or new, which is not indicated in the sentence. "Helpless" and "powerless" imply a lack of agency or ability, which does not match the situation described.
The word "contemplating" suggests that James is engaging in deep thought and reflection on the research results, rather than simply thinking about them or discovering them for the first time. The other choices do not accurately describe the level of introspection and consideration implied by the word "contemplating."
The sentence suggests that applying for a job while currently working can have a negative impact on someone. The option "anxiety and fear" is a common response to the stress of job searching while currently employed, as it can create a sense of uncertainty and pressure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the young attractive people's inhibitions were lowered due to drinking alcohol, which often leads to engaging in risky behaviors such as having sex. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Disorientation, throwing up, and frequent urination may all be potential side effects of excessive alcohol consumption, but they do not necessarily follow from the given sentence. Calling an Uber is not directly related to the behavior of the young attractive people after drinking.
A drill is a common tool used in dentistry for procedures such as drilling cavities, removing old fillings, and shaping teeth for crowns. Therefore, it's likely that a drill not being used would be found in a dentist office. The other options are all places where drills would commonly be used, making them unlikely choices. An oil rig would need drills to extract oil, a workshop or repair shop would use drills for various construction and repair tasks, and a tool shed would likely have drills available for use.
The context of the sentence suggests that John urgently needed to use a specific part of the house, and the mention of removing his pants implies that it is a private area. The most likely option is the bathroom, which is where people typically go to take care of their personal hygiene needs. The other choices, such as the living room, yard, and doughnut, do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the cat in the children's book had completed a quest and was returning to the castle. In this context, it is likely that the cat was returning to the castle to report to the king about the completion of its quest, which would explain why the correct answer is "see king". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the person has a passion for music, which suggests that they enjoy listening to music. The phrase "all day" suggests that this activity can be done for a prolonged period, so options like "skate" or "relax" don't seem to fit. "Opera" could be a possible answer since it's a type of music, but ultimately, the most fitting answer is "listen," which directly relates to a passion for music.
The sentence suggests that the plants are lacking in some essential nutrient or energy that they require for growth and sustenance. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants generate their own food using light energy from the sun, so it is a logical answer to the question of what they need to do for satiation. Reproduction, not drinking water, and growing tall may be important for the plants' overall health and survival, but they do not directly address the issue of hunger. Bearing fruits and vegetables may be a byproduct of healthy growth, but it is not directly related to the process of satiation.
The sentence suggests that Lane introduced James to Sam, leading Sam to think that James was a native. This implies that Lane knew James and had some level of familiarity with him, and that Lane's introduction created the impression for Sam that James was a local. The other choices (guide foreigners, foreigner, established, immigrant) do not fit the context of the sentence, which is discussing how Sam's perception of James was influenced by Lane's actions.
The sentence implies that much of the art that is being created today is not entirely original. This suggests that many artists are influenced by existing works or styles, leading to derivative pieces that draw heavily from pre-existing art. The other options do not fit with the idea of originality or creativity, and are therefore not appropriate choices.
The sentence suggests that the human enjoys making up questions for the A.I. overlords, so the correct answer should be a synonym for "enjoyable." "Do enjoy" and "enjoy living" both contain similar words, but they don't fit the sentence structure as well as "enjoyable" does. "Eat cake" and "get laid" are completely unrelated and can be eliminated as options.
Frisbee is a popular outdoor activity that is typically played in open spaces like parks, beaches or fields. While it is possible to throw a frisbee on a roof or in the air, these are not typical locations for playing the game. A golf course is also an unlikely location for frisbee play, as it is usually reserved for the sport of golf. The option "deadhead's van" does not make sense in the context of the question.
The phrase "on the rocks" is commonly used to request a mixed drink served over ice cubes. This is a way to serve the drink chilled while also diluting it slightly with the melting ice. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, and scotch is a specific type of alcoholic beverage that may or may not be used in mixed drinks.
The sentence is asking about where to put olives if you want to cook them, which suggests that they need to be stored in a container before being cooked. Putting them on a pizza or in an oven are cooking methods, while pressing them for their oil is a completely different process. Refrigerating them may be a step in the process, but it doesn't answer the question of where to put them specifically for cooking purposes. Therefore, the correct answer is jar, as olives are often stored in jars in oil or brine.
European red foxes are native to Europe and parts of Asia, which are located in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, it is most likely that a European red fox roaming in the wild would be on the northern hemisphere of the earth. The other options do not provide any relevant information about the location of the fox.
The sentence suggests that the item being referred to is made of felt, which is a common material used in the production of hats. Additionally, the specific mention of a "man's hat" narrows down the options to a specific type of hat, as opposed to shoes, tables, or clothes. The option "hat shop" is not an article of apparel or accessory, but rather a location where items such as hats may be purchased.
The question implies that the person does not currently possess a marker, so they would need to obtain one from somewhere else. The most likely place to find a marker would be an office supply store, as that is a common location for purchasing writing implements. The other options (desk, pocket, drawer, briefcase) are all possible locations, but they would depend on if the person had already had a marker there, which the question does not suggest.
Fishing is a sport or activity that involves trying to catch fish with various types of equipment and techniques. The sentence asks what someone is doing if they are fishing, so the correct answer would be related to the activity of catching fish. The other options do not accurately describe the action of fishing.
The term "civilians" often refers to people who are not part of the military, so the only option where it would make sense to see them standing in a line inside would be a military base. Bus stops, apartments, swimming pools, and water fountains are all unlikely places to find civilians standing in a line indoors.
The other options do not provide any relevant information about whether there will be a cloud in the sky. "Night or day" and "atmosphere" are too general and broad to provide any specific information about cloud formation. "Car" and "murky liquid" have no connection to the context of the question. The most logical and reliable source of information about weather conditions is a weather report, which can provide specific forecasts for cloud cover.
A small house typically has limited space, which means that a dining room or conference room may not be present. Additionally, a furniture store or roof would not typically have a table in the context of a small house. However, the kitchen is a common place to have a table in a small house, as it can serve as both a dining area and a workspace. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be kitchen.
Grapes are typically grown for the purpose of making wine, and the winery is where the grapes are processed and turned into wine. While grapes may end up in other places, such as a fruit stand, field, or garage, the correct answer is the winery because it is the final destination for grapes that are grown for winemaking. The option "painting" does not make sense in this context since grapes cannot physically go into a painting.
The sentence suggests that Billy doesn't trust the lighting at certain places, so he takes his desk lamp with him. The options "office," "corner," "shop," and "house" are all locations where Billy may have a more consistent and reliable light source, making them unlikely choices for the correct answer. "Hotel" is the only option that suggests a temporary location that Billy may not be familiar with, and where he may not trust the lighting.
The question is asking for the largest state with a coast in the US, so we can eliminate options like "country" and "united states." New York has a coastline, but it is not the largest state with a coast. Florida has a long coastline, but it is not the largest state overall. California, on the other hand, has a coastline that extends over 840 miles, making it the largest state with a coast in the US.
Roses are a popular flower for ornamental gardening, and they are commonly planted in flower gardens. While they can handle a range of temperatures, a temperate climate is not necessary for their growth. Botanical gardens and hedgerows may also have roses, but a flower garden is more likely to have a variety of plants that complement the roses. A front lawn may not have the optimal growing conditions for a healthy rosebush.
Animals are often associated with open spaces and natural environments like meadows, where they can run, play and interact with one another. The other options - fairgrounds, kennel, surface of earth and zoos - are unlikely to be the correct answers as they do not fit the context of the question which suggests a natural environment where animals are free to roam around.
The sentence suggests that the activity being described involves playing basketball, which is a sport commonly played in a gymnasium. The use of the word "echoed" suggests a large, open space, such as a gymnasium, where sound can bounce repeatedly off the walls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a place where people specifically go to gain knowledge. Out of the choices provided, only a classroom fits this description. Classrooms are typically associated with educational settings where individuals can learn, study, and develop their knowledge of different subjects. The other options do not have any clear association with learning or gaining knowledge.
The sentence indicates that the crossroads had no traffic, which suggests that it was located in a more remote area. The option "desert" seems like the most logical choice, as deserts are often sparsely populated and not heavily trafficked. The other options do not fit the description of a deserted crossroads.
The sentence suggests that the children loved visiting a place that had love, candy, and a small dog. This indicates that the place was likely a comfortable and welcoming environment, and the fact that a small dog was mentioned suggests that it may have been a home rather than a communal living space like an apartment complex or trailer park. The mention of "grandmother's" further suggests a familial setting, making "grandmother's house" the most fitting choice among the options given.
The sentence states that Jim gave advice to the homeless person, so the answer must be "advice." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. The fact that Jim is not religious suggests that the advice he offered was likely not related to religion, but this cannot be determined definitively.
Cups are commonly used for drinking and are typically kept on a table in a kitchen or dining area. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A closet is for storing clothes and other items, an apartment is a type of housing, a cupholder is a feature in a car, and a restaurant is a place to eat but not necessarily where you keep a cup.
A DVD typically contains a recording of a movie, which is a cinematic production. Concert halls, circuses, and theatres typically offer live performances that are not typically recorded on DVD, although some concerts or theatrical productions may be recorded and sold as DVDs after the fact. Singing is a broad category that could technically apply to any of the other performance types listed, so it is not a helpful clue in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person is buying gum, candy, and popcorn before watching something. The only option that fits with this context is movies, as they are typically associated with purchasing snacks before viewing a film. The other options, such as a water fountain, store or sidewalk, do not fit with the context of purchasing snacks before watching something. The option of hospital does not fit either, as the sentence does not indicate that the person is going to a hospital to watch something.
The therapist's advice to "get out there and begin socialising" suggests that the person should try to meet and interact with other people. The purpose of this is likely to develop connections with others, which is a primary motivation for forming friendships. The other options do not align with the advice given by the therapist or the context of the sentence.
Car parts are typically stored in a location that is easily accessible and related to the maintenance or repair of vehicles. The garage is a common location for storing car parts as it is often where repairs and maintenance are performed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that something happens after someone lives a life, and the most common and expected outcome is death, which is the end of one's life. The other options are either not applicable or incomprehensible in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "workers in suits and ties" suggests a professional environment, and the term "ground floor" implies a larger structure with multiple floors. Of the options provided, only an office building fits this description. A brownstone is typically a small residential building, a highrise building could house a variety of businesses and individuals, a hotel would not necessarily require workers in suits and ties, and a school would most likely not have a ground floor designated for professional workers.
Hydrogen is a gas that is often used in chemistry labs, where it can be stored in containers for various experiments. While it is also found in the universe and as a component of air, these options do not specifically refer to containers that would hold hydrogen. The ocean and barrel options do not make sense in the context of storing hydrogen.
Since Billy is an archaeologist who is interested in ancient human civilization, he is more likely to enjoy finding a library than the other options. A library contains books and manuscripts that may provide valuable information about the culture and history of a particular civilization. The other options such as school, love, adventure, and space shuttle do not necessarily have a connection to archaeology or ancient civilization.
The sentence suggests that the man is not engaged in something productive, and rather than focusing on his work or responsibilities, he is watching television. The phrase "much to do" implies that he has responsibilities or tasks that require his attention, but he is choosing to prioritize entertainment over completing them, which suggests he is wasting time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that getting in line for a long time can be difficult or challenging for a person, indicating that certain traits or characteristics may be needed in order to do so successfully. The option "patience" directly addresses this, suggesting that waiting in line requires a certain level of endurance and ability to tolerate discomfort or frustration. The other options do not directly relate to this idea or provide a convincing explanation for what is needed to wait in line.
Going for a run can sometimes cause physical pain or discomfort, especially if a person is not properly hydrated or has not properly stretched before exercising. Leg cramps are a common issue that can occur during or after a run and can cause significant discomfort. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The phrase "to join the hand" suggests that the person is getting ready to play poker, and "ante up" is a common phrase used in poker to indicate that someone is putting money into the pot to begin playing. Therefore, the correct answer is "ante up." The other options are not directly related to the act of starting a game of poker.
Marmots are herbivores, which means that they primarily eat plants. As a result, they are likely to be good at finding food sources in their environment, such as grasses, herbs, and other vegetation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the characteristics or behavior of marmots.
The use of the phrase "boarding group" suggests that the sentence is referring to an activity in an airport, which is often associated with airplane travel. The other options - theatre, wedding hall, show, and auditorium - have no clear connection to airplane travel and therefore are not likely to be the correct answer.
The phrase "out of the way spot" suggests that James was looking for a location that is not in the main area or easily visible. A corner is a logical choice for such a location as it is often away from the center of the room and can provide a cozy and intimate setting for a floor lamp. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as an office or desktop would be too visible and next to the bed and at a hotel do not specify a location within a room.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a portable writing instrument that a man may want to bring with him. The options of purse and desk drawer are associated with women and stationary locations, respectively, and are therefore unlikely to be correct. A briefcase is a possibility, but not all men carry a briefcase, and the question seems to be asking for the most common answer. A classroom is a location, not a place to put a writing instrument. A pocket, on the other hand, is a common and convenient place for a man to put a writing instrument when he is on-the-go.
The sentence describes two bookends on a shelf, which are used to support a line of books. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make sense in relation to the use of bookends on a shelf.
The sentence mentions that people were worshiping when the electricity went out, which strongly suggests that they were in a place of worship such as a church. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah did not allow proper ventilation for the birds in the jar. Birds need to breathe, so lack of air flow would be harmful or fatal to them. The other options do not make sense in this context - picking berries or reproducing would not be relevant to why the birds died, and the terms "sky" and "roof" do not relate to the situation at all.
The sentence mentions Snoopy and Charlie, who are commonly associated with the comic strip "Peanuts" by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy is a dog, which can help rule out the options cat, house, carpet, and rug. The sentence mentions that Charlie was treating his pet, which also suggests that the correct answer is related to an animal. Therefore, the correct answer must be dog as it is the only option that is related to an animal and fits the context of the sentence.
The question asks about building character and padding a resume, which suggests that the answer should be something that is seen as a positive trait or accomplishment. Hanging out and smoking are not productive activities that would typically be included on a resume or seen as character-building. Being stranded on a desert island may be a unique experience, but it is not something that one can actively choose to do. Homework is important for academic success, but it is not necessarily related to building character or padding a resume. On the other hand, volunteering is a common way for teens to gain valuable experiences, develop skills, and demonstrate their commitment to helping others, all of which can enhance their character and impress potential employers or colleges.
The context suggests that the person in question is lacking happiness, which is most commonly associated with a fulfilling and enjoyable life. The choices "fiddle," "sing," "play games," and "run in circles" do not directly address the issue of unhappiness, while "live life" offers a solution that is relevant and logical.
The sentence suggests that Billy was looking for a tool that he needed in order to do some work that required a hammer. The most obvious place to keep a hammer would be in a tool box, which is designed specifically to hold tools. The other options could also contain tools, but they are less likely choices because they are not designed specifically to hold tools like a tool box is.
The sentence suggests that the young boy was afraid to dance and chose to spend the entire evening in a corner of the auditorium. The phrase "sitting still" suggests that he did not move around or participate in any activities, indicating that he was likely feeling anxious or uncomfortable. The other options, such as "celebrate" and "partner," do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct answers.
The phrase "do time" is a common idiom that refers to serving a criminal sentence in jail or prison. It is likely that a prisoner would have to "do time" if they have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment. The other options may be associated with a person in prison, but they are not as directly related to the concept of serving a sentence as "do time" is.
The sentence suggests that John is reaching an age when he is starting high school. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Teach class" would be unlikely for a 15-year-old, "try to get" is unclear, "go to class" is too generic and doesn't convey any particular goal or milestone, and "study book" doesn't make sense as a standalone activity.
The key phrase in the sentence is "having fun," which suggests that the answer choices are related to positive emotions commonly associated with enjoyable experiences. Enjoyment and euphoria refer to feelings of happiness and pleasure, while excitement can involve a sense of anticipation or thrill. Crying is not typically associated with having fun, and while laughter can be a sign of enjoyment, it is not the only possible reaction to a fun experience.
The sentence implies that when going on vacation, one needs to do something with the things they want to take with them. The most logical option for this would be to pack those items. Paying bills and saving money are unrelated to the context of the sentence. Selling items is not necessary unless one is trying to downsize or make extra money. Having money is also not related to the act of packing.
Meteors are visible from Earth's atmosphere, so the correct answer would be a location that can be observed from our planet. Outerspace and orbit are too far away to see a meteor with the naked eye and an observatory may be useful in tracking and predicting meteor showers, but not necessary to see a single meteor. Universe refers to everything that exists, so it is not a specific location on Earth to observe a meteor.
Plamodel (short for "plastic model") refers to kits that allow users to assemble various models, such as vehicles or figures, from plastic pieces. The other options (plasticulture, cookies, cups, and plastisol) are not related to creating something new in the same way that plamodels are. Plasticulture, for example, refers to the application of plastics in agriculture, while cookies, cups, and plastisol are all unrelated to the act of creating something new.
The sentence mentions that "many people take public transportation," which suggests that the answer is probably a place where people wait for buses or trains. The options "cricket ground," "surface of earth," or "football stadium" do not fit this description, so the correct answer must be either "train station" or "bus depot".
The context of the sentence suggests that the toilet was likely in a place that is frequently used by people who may not be sober, such as a party or a motel room. The other options do not fit this context, as trains, restaurants, stadiums, and space shuttles are not typically associated with overuse or drunken use of toilets.
Containers are commonly used for storing both food and liquid. The other options, such as garage or pantry, do not typically require a container for storage.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is going to a party of other singles, which likely means that they are looking to socialize and meet new people. The other options, such as racing cars or visiting friends, do not necessarily align with the context of going to a party and meeting new people. Additionally, while drinking alcohol may be a common activity at parties, it is not necessarily the main reason why someone would go to a party of other singles.
The sentence suggests that the individuals were dining out at a place where they could order a meal and also choose a dessert from a selection that was presented to them. A buffet, movies, box, and supermarket are not typically places where this scenario would occur. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "restaurant."
The question suggests that waiting for a sale may be a good idea before making a purchase. The word "buying" is the only choice that directly connects to this idea. The other options are either specific store names or descriptors that do not give any indication of whether or not it is a good idea to wait for a sale before making a purchase.
The sentence states that the person is playing basketball through an injury, indicating that they are experiencing pain. The phrase "ignore the pain" is a common expression used when someone is trying to push through discomfort to achieve a goal. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as sweating, cheers, and having fun are not obstacles to playing with an injury, and the knee injury is already mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the building in question is a rustic or primitive structure with drafting floors. The fact that the friends slept in lofts also implies that the building has a high ceiling. Of the given choices, the most likely option is a hunting lodge, which is typically constructed in a remote area and may have a simple, functional design. The other options do not fit the characteristics defined in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Joe's shopping habit was causing him some negative consequences despite having a good job and having extra funds. The word "dangerous" implies that there might be some risky or harmful behavior involved, which could be overspending. The phrase "not enough for his taste" suggests that Joe was looking to spend more money than what he had, indicating that he might be overspending. The other options do not seem to accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Maintaining eye contact is one of the key elements in having successful communication with someone. It shows that you are engaged and paying attention to what they are saying, and can help to build trust and connection between the parties involved. The other options do not contribute to successful communication and may even hinder it. "Being heard" and "conversation" are important, but maintaining eye contact is a specific action that helps achieve these goals. "Not listening" obviously has nothing to do with successful communication.
The sentence suggests that large trucks have the ability to fling rocks on the highway, which can be problematic for other cars. In particular, the rocks can damage or break the windows of cars, which could lead to potential safety hazards. Seat belts and trunks are not likely to be affected by rock flinging, and diesel engines and exhaust pipes are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that after the deer has eaten the rosebush, a person will begin to do something related to plants or gardening. The most logical answer is 'planting', as it directly relates to replacing the rosebush that was eaten. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A knob is typically used to adjust settings, such as volume, temperature or brightness. In this case, the question implies that the knob is used for a device that has various settings that need to be adjusted, which fits with a control panel. The other options do not typically use knobs to change settings, for example, opening doors usually require a handle rather than a knob, which is typically used to rotate.
The question suggests that the sun was affecting the residents inside a room or a house, and the word "warm" is used in the sentence. This indicates that the sun was likely creating a warm temperature inside. The other options, such as dry clothes, tan, or dry ground, do not make sense in the context of the question.
The question is asking about a reason why someone would eat fruit, of which the primary purpose is for taste and enjoyment. While some people may eat fruit for health or nutritional benefits, the choices "monkey," "go off," "keep fresh," and "market" do not offer any reasons why someone would actively choose to eat fruit. Therefore, "taste sweet" is the most logical and supported answer.
The options "mail order" and "ship goods" are both commonly used methods to get products to customers. "Carrier pigeon" is not a viable option for most companies, as it is not a reliable or efficient method of delivery. "Own factory" is also not necessarily a method of delivery, as it refers to where the products are manufactured, not how they are delivered to customers. "Commit crime" is obviously not a legitimate option for any company.
The sentence suggests that John missed the real cause of death because he only gave a perfunctory examination. This implies that if he had done a more thorough examination, he may have found the real cause of death. Therefore, the correct answer is "thorough." The other options don't necessarily imply a more in-depth examination, and therefore are not as relevant to the context of the sentence.
When you drink a lot of water, your bladder is able to stretch and hold more liquid than when it is empty. This is because the bladder's walls are made of smooth muscle tissue that can expand and contract to accommodate the amount of fluid inside. The other options do not accurately describe what happens to the bladder when it fills with liquid.
The sentence suggests that James dislikes communicating through mail because he doesn't like waiting for something. The other options don't really fit the context - "response" could be a possibility, but it doesn't convey the idea of waiting. "Learning" and "exchanging ideas" don't make sense in the context of waiting, and "confusion" doesn't relate to the issue of not liking communication via mail. Therefore, the correct answer is "the mail to be delivered."
The sentence suggests that there is a barrier to buying products, which is difficult or impossible to overcome if you experience a certain condition. The word "bankruptcy" means a lack of financial resources, which would certainly prevent someone from buying products. The other options do not have any clear connection to a lack of resources.
The sentence is asking how to carry groceries, suggesting that the items are likely purchased from a grocery store. Shopping bags are a common way to transport groceries, and the other options do not make sense in this context. Restaurants are not relevant to the scenario, two wheels could refer to a bike but the sentence does not suggest this, vegetable soup is unrelated, and exhaust pipe is not a practical way to carry groceries.
The phrase "public recreational areas" typically refers to shared outdoor spaces where people can participate in leisure activities together. This suggests that the purpose of these areas is to create a sense of community within the condominium complex, where residents can interact and engage in shared experiences. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a state that still has wild bald eagles. Canada is not a state, but a country. Cliff and mountains are not states either, but geographic features that could be habitats for bald eagles. Captivity would not be a correct answer since the question is asking for wild bald eagles. Utah is the correct answer as it is one of the few states in the US where bald eagles still exist in the wild.
The question is asking specifically about what needs to be cleaned up after a party, which may include things like empty cups, plates, and general debris. The other options, such as a son's room or a dishwasher, do not necessarily have any connection to the context of the question. The dish washer option is too similar to the dishwasher option to be a separate, distinct choice. The dining room could be associated with a party, but it does not represent the general cleanup that would be required after a party.
The sentence suggests that Lilly enjoys watching films as a way to relax before going to sleep. The other options (falling asleep, fatigue, crying, fall asleep) are related to the physical or emotional effects of watching films, whereas entertainment is the only option that refers to the enjoyment or pleasure that Lilly derives from them.
The sentence suggests that the weasel was housed in a location that was accessible to the children, as they were able to come visit it. The only option that fits this context is classroom, which is a common location for pets in educational settings. The other options do not make sense in this context.
The sentence is asking for a requirement that is necessary for an organism to continue living. Out of the options given, only "food consumed" directly relates to the basic biological need for nutrients and energy to sustain life processes. While reproducing is necessary for the continuation of a species, it doesn't necessarily apply to an individual organism's survival. "Eventually die" and "growing older" are not requirements, but rather eventualities that occur during the course of life. "Money" is not a biological requirement for living organisms.
The sentence suggests that the children were engaging in a playful activity that involved causing each other to laugh. Tickle is a common way to do this among children. Play ball, reading a book, jump rope, and see exhibits do not typically involve causing laughter between children.
The sentence suggests that the needle is being looked for in a place where it is commonly found, and the options present a list of places where needles are likely to be found. A haystack is a common expression used to describe the difficulty of finding something small and sharp like a needle, so it is an unlikely place to find one. A spool of thread is also a likely place to find a needle since they are often used together in sewing. A box of needles and a doctor's office are both places where needles are commonly stored and used, so they are also unlikely places to find a needle. However, a hospital does not typically keep needles lying around, but rather uses them in a controlled and sterile environment, making it the least likely place to find a needle.
The sentence suggests that something falls out of the sky and is generally well received, implying that it is something beneficial. Rain water is commonly associated with being beneficial and well received as it nourishes plants and replenishes water sources. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The description of a location where you would sit in bleachers and watch large men run strongly implies a sporting event, and specifically one where men are running around on a field. The term "bleachers" specifically refers to a type of seating often found at sporting events like baseball, basketball, and football games, but the description of large men running suggests that it is likely a football game, where players are often larger and more physically imposing than in other sports. The other options (pharmacy, concert, soccer game) do not fit the description provided.
The sentence suggests that John took his appointment book with him to the checkup but could not find it anywhere. Later, he found it after buying a new one, going home, and taking a shower. The fact that he found it after taking a shower implies that it was on his person while he was at the checkup. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he looked for the appointment book but couldn't find it, which suggests that it was not in his handbag, wallet, or any other place where he would normally keep it. Therefore, the most likely option is that the appointment book was in his pocket, which he discovered after taking off his clothes for the shower.
A city cat is a domestic cat that lives in an urban environment. They are often seen wandering around back alleys in search of food or shelter. Compost piles and garbage cans may attract stray cats, but it is unlikely that they would be a regular habitat for a city cat. The milky way galaxy is not a location where a cat can physically live. While a backyard may be a part of a city cat's territory, it is not specific enough to be the correct answer for this question.
The question relates to the common practice of keeping salt in a container called a shaker, which is designed for easy dispensing. The other options are not relevant to the context of mealtime and the practice of seasoning food.
Research suggests that many girls experience some pain or discomfort during their first sexual experience due to the stretching of the hymen or vaginal opening. While some girls may experience pleasure or no pain at all, the options "pleasant," "irritating," "effect of burning calories," and "dirty" do not accurately reflect the common experiences or feelings associated with the first time having sex for a girl.
The sentence provides three distinct clues about the location John is booking a flight to: it is known for being foggy, residents enjoy tea, and it is ruled by a Queen. These three characteristics are all associated with England, a country known for its frequent fog, traditional tea culture, and a constitutional monarchy under Queen Elizabeth II. The other options have no connection to the clues provided in the sentence.
The question is asking for an alternative furniture item that can be used for relaxation in a bedroom. While some of the other choices, such as a sofa or couch, could be used for relaxation, they may not fit in a typical bedroom due to space constraints. A chair is a more likely option as it can be small and comfortable, and is often found in bedrooms for reading or relaxing. Footbed is not a common piece of furniture for relaxing, and furniture is too broad of a category to provide a specific answer.
The phrase "handsome prince" is a common trope in fairy tales, where the prince often serves as the romantic hero who rescues the damsel in distress. While there may be princes in real-life courts and castles, the use of the term "handsome prince" suggests a fictional portrayal rather than a historical or factual one. The option "fairy tale" is the most specific and relevant to the context.
The sentence implies that the child was forcefully taken from its parents, which suggests that the correct answer would relate to the direction in which the child was taken. "Away from" is the only option that indicates a direction, while the other options do not provide any clear indication of direction or context.
The word "sale" suggests that milk is being sold, which would typically occur in a store or shop. The option "supermarket" is a common place where milk is sold, whereas the other options do not make sense in the context of milk being sold. The options "opera", "apartment", "train station", "the refrigerator", and "kitchen" do not typically involve the sale of milk.
The sentence suggests that Billy placed chairs somewhere, which implies a physical space. The most likely place for chairs to be set up is on a floor, which is a common surface for furniture. The other options, such as conference or theater, describe larger spaces or events and do not specify a surface. Building and online are even more vague options that do not relate to the physical placement of chairs.
The sentence suggests that something significant happens to a child when they reach their late teens, indicating a milestone in their life. The commonly accepted idea is that a child becomes a legal adult at 18 years old, marking the end of their childhood and the beginning of their adult life. The other options such as cleaning their room or reading a book may be tasks associated with being a responsible adult, but they do not represent a significant life change. Getting married is also a common milestone for adults, but not all children get married in their late teens.
The sentence indicates that the father is encouraging the kids to play games because he doesn't like seeing them sitting around and looking bored. Therefore, the correct answer is "bored." The other choices are possible reasons why the father may have told the kids to play games, but they do not directly relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam feels like he has destructive abilities, which may lead one to assume that he does not feel confident in his creative abilities. Therefore, when he discovers that he is capable of creating something, he is surprised. The other choices do not align with the context of the sentence, as they imply that Sam is capable of fixing or building something, which is not implied in the sentence.
The sentence clearly states that the person feels like they are getting a cold, which indicates that they are not feeling well. Therefore, the correct answer is illness. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not fit the information given.
The sentence refers to storing canned goods behind a type of door, suggesting that it is a closed storage area, such as a pantry, where goods are commonly kept. The other options, such as a cabinet, cupboard, or even supermarket, do not necessarily imply that canned goods would be specifically stored there.
The word "not" in the question suggests that we need to find an option that is not a reason to go for a run. Pulling a muscle is a negative outcome that can occur during a run and is not a reason to go for a run. The other options suggest positive outcomes such as improved health, weight loss, and increased fitness, which are common reasons people choose to go for a run.
The sentence suggests that the bungalows are located in a small area, implying a sense of community. The terminology "group" further supports the idea of a collection of homes in close proximity to each other. The word "neighborhood" specifically refers to a small, defined area that is inhabited by a community of people living in proximity to one another. The other options, such as "park," "woods," and "suburbs," do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bed" is not an appropriate term to describe a group of bungalows.
The phrase "peanuts or Cracker Jacks" is often associated with a baseball game, as it is a common snack sold at concession stands. The fact that the person in the sentence couldn't have these snacks because of allergies suggests that they were at a baseball game, which makes the correct answer "ballpark." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Continents are large landmasses that are typically divided based on geology, geography, and culture. Asia is one of the seven continents on Earth, which includes Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Islands, oceans, and Australia are not continents, but they are geographical features that can be found on or around them.
Paintings of pastoral scenes often depict serene landscapes with picturesque settings, conveying a sense of peace or tranquility. This type of artwork generally portrays nature in its unspoiled form, and viewers may experience a sense of relaxation or calmness when viewing these artworks. The other options such as seeing artifacts, joy, wonder, and shock do not fit with the context of the question which is about a specific emotion that may be elicited by viewing pastoral scenes.
The sentence suggests that the organ being referred to is part of the human body and cannot be played in the traditional sense. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a system or a music store may contain organs that can be played, while a cathedral or a band hall may have instruments called organs that can be played, but they are not part of the human body.
The sentence states that James is a senior, which typically refers to a student in their final year of high school or college. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The typo in the second option, where "talking" should be "taking," does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the typical location of buildings (overground) and something else. The options "tall," "huge," "small," and "overground" are all related to size or height, which is not the opposite of being located overground. The opposite of being overground is being underground, which is the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the situation being described is related to a legal accusation or trial. One person having a briefcase may indicate that they are a lawyer or someone involved in the legal system. The option "to help" does not make sense in this context, and the options "hand" and "desk" do not relate to a legal accusation. The option "airport" could potentially be relevant if the accusation occurred in an airport, but there is no clear indication of this in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person was actively filling up their cart, which suggests that they were likely purchasing items rather than just browsing. The option "debt" implies a negative context and is not supported by the sentence. "Giving up" and "meeting friends" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Compare prices" may be a possible choice, but it is not clear if the person was actively comparing prices or just making purchases.
The question is asking for the type of word used as a preposition to someone. The other answer choices are not types of words that function as prepositions in a sentence. A pronoun is a type of word used to replace a noun, while an adjective describes a noun. Position refers to a physical location or placement, while an interjection is a word used to express emotions or feelings. A conjunction is a word used to join clauses or sentences together. Therefore, the correct answer is preposition, as it is the type of word used to indicate the relationship between someone and another element in the sentence.
The sentence implies that playing violin can evoke strong emotions in a person, which is a common experience shared by many musicians. The act of creating music is often seen as an emotional outlet, where the musician can express their feelings through their instrument. The other options, such as sadness or hunger, are not necessarily associated with playing music and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the individual was using a bucket to retrieve something, but it was empty. The most likely scenario is that they were attempting to retrieve water from a well, which can often dry up. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "palatial estate" suggests that the property in question was a grand and luxurious residence, typically denoting a mansion or a large and opulent house. The drawing room, being a central feature of such a property, would most likely be located within the main building, which would be the mansion or large house. The other options such as artist's house or bordello do not fit the context of a grand and opulent estate. The term "studio" could potentially fit if the property belonged to an artist, but without more information, it is less likely than "mansion" or "large house."
The sentence suggests that the man worked in a place where large containers are unloaded from delivery trucks, which is a common practice in warehouses. The fact that the containers always had food in them could be a hint that the man worked in a food-related warehouse, such as a distribution center for a grocery store or a warehouse for a food production company. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence as they do not involve large containers being unloaded from delivery trucks.
The sentence implies that achieving something is a positive experience, which is often associated with a sense of pride or accomplishment. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this context.
The question is asking for what always happens during lunch, and the most common and expected action during a meal is to eat food. The other options may happen during lunch, but they are not guaranteed or universally experienced by everyone during a meal, unlike the act of eating food.
The sentence suggests that studios spend a lot of money on something, and the only option that is related to the film industry is "movies." Studios typically invest a significant amount of money in making movies, including hiring talent, renting equipment, creating sets and special effects, and marketing the finished product. None of the other options have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When going through a divorce or separation, a lawyer is often necessary to help navigate the legal process and ensure that each party's rights are protected. While friends may provide emotional support, civil authorities and judges may be involved in the process, but they are not typically sought out as a direct source of assistance. "Trouble" is not a viable option as it does not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Jim's reason for not wanting to talk on the phone with his family is because it brings up painful feelings for him. The word "painful" implies that the feelings are negative and not something he wants to experience. The choice "regret" is the most likely because it suggests that Jim may have made choices or decisions in the past that he now regrets, and therefore wants to avoid interacting with his family. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for the reason why people spend money, and the answer that best fits the context is "buy things." People spend money in order to purchase goods and services that they need or want. "Spend cash" and "go shopping" are both ways of spending money, but they do not fully answer the question of why people do so. "Have job" and "make money" are factors that may enable people to spend money, but they do not address the direct reason for spending it.
The sentence implies that leaving through a window is a possible option, but it is not the only way to leave a home. The front door is the most common and expected way to exit a home, which makes it the correct answer. The other options (office, wall, and building) are not relevant to the context of leaving a home. Additionally, "wall" is repeated twice in the choices, suggesting that it was an error in the options.
The word "queue" typically refers to a line or sequence of people waiting for something, so the most logical answer would be "waiting". The other options may be relevant to someone in a queue, but do not directly describe what happens when standing in a queue.
Seattle is well known for its rainy weather, often being jokingly referred to as the "rainy city". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions a film and discomfort, which suggests that the clientele were at a place where movies are shown. The option "movie theatre" is the only choice that fits this context, as the other options do not have any clear connection to films or air conditioning.
Ball bearings are commonly used in machinery and mechanical applications to reduce friction and allow for efficient movement or rotation. The other options (support axial loads, can, allow movement, church) do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence or the use of ball bearings.
The sentence indicates that the guy was successful in cashing in his check, which implies that he received some form of payment or reward. It is likely that he would feel a sense of relief or happiness after being able to cash in the check. The option "extra money" also suggests a positive outcome, but it does not describe the guy's emotional state. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a specific action that can be taken to please parents with regards to a house. The option "buy" may seem like a possibility, but it is vague and doesn't specify what needs to be bought. "Graffiti it" is clearly not a desirable action for a house. "Respect" and "success" are vague and don't provide any information on what needs to be done. "Liked by" is the best option as it suggests that parents will be pleased if they like the house, which could be achieved through various means such as appealing design, good maintenance, or a desirable location.
The question suggests that reading newspapers nowadays has a negative effect on the reader, leading to a feeling of aggravation. This could be due to the prevalence of negative news stories and sensationalized headlines commonly found in modern newspapers. The other options are not related to the context of the question and do not provide any insight into the intended answer.
Crab is a type of seafood commonly sold at fish markets. Hotels and markets may sell seafood, but it's not clear if they specialize in crab specifically. Chesapeake Bay is a specific location known for its seafood, but it's not a type of establishment. Tidepools and beach sand are not places where one would typically go to buy crab.
The verb "scoop up" suggests that the bird is trying to gather or collect something. In this case, the bird is trying to gather more air. Since birds use their wings to fly and to manipulate air currents, it makes sense that spreading their wings would be the action they would take to scoop up more air. The other options, such as laying eggs, heading south, or squawking, do not relate to air scooping.
The question indicates that the excess ottoman needs a place to go, so it is likely that it is currently taking up space in a room where it is not needed. Out of the choices given, a living room is the most logical place for extra furniture. A furniture store is where one would go to buy furniture, not to place it, and a basement or parlor may not be suitable areas for furniture that is intended for regular use. The option "turkey" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person received help from his father and feels glad about it. The opposite of feeling glad in this context would be feeling unhappy. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Regretful would suggest that the person had made a mistake, which is not implied in the sentence. Hatred is too extreme a reaction to not receiving help. Downcast and disappointed both suggest a degree of sadness, but don't work as opposites to feeling glad.
When shopping at a store, it is common for customers to wait in a line until it is their turn to make a purchase. This is a standard practice in most stores as it helps to maintain order and ensures that customers are served fairly. The other options do not relate to the act of purchasing something at a store.
The phrase "green thumb" is commonly used to describe someone who is skilled at gardening and can make plants thrive. The sentence states that the person in question did not have this skill and every time she tried to make something grow, it would die. Therefore, the correct answer is "die." The other options, such as growth, flowering, ground, and plants, might seem like plausible choices, but they do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a person who is going out often and talking to a lot of people has a certain type of lifestyle or behavior. The term "social" relates to interactions between people, and a person who has an active social life would be engaging in activities and interactions with others frequently. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as well as "social life."
The sentence implies that the person took action to achieve their dreams, as opposed to accepting their fate or feeling upset. "Spring into action" means to take quick and decisive action, which fits with the idea that the person was proactive in pursuing their goals. The other options do not align with the idea of taking action towards a goal.
The age of the player suggests that he is likely playing on a high school football team, as this is the age range typically associated with high school athletics. It is also common for high schools to have their own football fields for home games. The other options, such as college campus, Oklahoma, park, or school campus, do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Fraternities are typically associated with college campuses, so it would make sense for the gymnasium they prefer to work out at to also be located on a college campus. The other options (spa, high school, school or YMCA, stadium) don't fit the context of the sentence as well.
The other options do not make sense as a way to eat a potato. Restaurants might offer potato dishes, but they do not describe a specific way to eat a potato. Vegetable soup might contain potatoes, but it is not a way to eat a potato on its own. Exhaust pipes and shopping bags are not related to eating potatoes. With sour cream and cheese is a popular way to eat potatoes, especially baked potatoes, and is a commonly recognized option.
Buying a ticket in person typically involves physically going to a location where tickets are sold, which in the case of trains is usually a ticket booth. A train depot may also have a ticket booth, but not necessarily. "Purse" and "manual" are not relevant to the context of buying train tickets. A conductor's hand would only be used to collect a ticket that has already been purchased.
The sentence suggests that after experiencing shock, the person settled down and felt a certain way. The word "calm" is often associated with feeling relaxed or at ease, which makes sense in the context of someone settling down after experiencing shock. The other options either contradict or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that a container holding hot liquid broke when it hit the ground. Choosing "coffeepot" as the correct answer is supported by the fact that coffeepots are commonly used to hold hot liquids and have plastic handles that can break if dropped. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Fungi are often studied in biology labs, as they are important organisms to understand in the context of ecology, genetics, and disease. While fungi can certainly be found in caves and on decaying matter, the reference to a university suggests that the context is academic in nature. Mushroom hunting and old cheese are less likely to be associated with a university setting.
The sentence implies that in order to go on stage after an audition, one must possess a certain quality or skill. The phrase "have talent" is commonly associated with performing on stage, as it suggests that the person has a natural ability or skill in acting or some other talent that is useful for stage performances. The other options do not necessarily apply to performing on stage or do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker believes a garden would be more valuable than gasoline, and specifically mentions a hop garden as a possible example. This may indicate that the speaker is interested in gardening or horticulture, and believes that growing hops would be a valuable use of land. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that after years of work, something was finally brought to fruition, which means it was completed or accomplished. Out of the choices given, "build" is the only option that makes sense in this context. "Laugh" and "anxiety" do not fit the tone of the sentence, and "excitement" and "celebrate" don't directly relate to the idea becoming a reality.
The sentence mentions that wood is covered thinly with gold metal, which is a process known as gilding. Gilding is a common decorative technique in which a thin layer of gold or gold-colored metal is applied to a surface. The other options do not accurately describe the process of gilding, as they do not relate to the use of gold or the thinness of the layer applied.
The sentence mentions the loss of soldiers' lives, which is a common occurrence during a war. The word "general" also suggests that there was a military operation, and apologizing for confusion is a common response when things go wrong in a war. The other options, such as Germany, class, quandry, or opera, do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
Local fans are likely to showcase an athlete at a sporting event, such as a game or competition, where the athlete can demonstrate their skills in real-time. Museums and locker rooms are not typically places where athletes are showcased, and while the Olympics is a major sporting event, it is not specific to a local fanbase. A stadium is a possible option, but it is still most commonly used as a venue for sporting events.
The opposite of dissociate is to join or connect with someone or something. Dissociate refers to the act of disconnecting or separating, so the opposite would be to bring together or unite. Fuse, unit, combine, and incorporate can also be synonyms for join, but in this context, join is the best answer as it is the most commonly used opposite of dissociate.
The question is asking about a common item that people wear on their feet, which would be shoes and socks. Floors, tables, surfaces, and desks are not typically associated with being worn on one's feet, making those options unlikely choices.
Columbia is the capital city of South Carolina, which means that this state is the most likely answer. While other states may have a city with the same name, the context of the question suggests that the question specifically pertains to the capital city of a state. Therefore, options such as Wyoming, Tennessee, and Missouri can be eliminated because they do not have a city called Columbia that serves as a state capital. Similarly, Washington DC is not a state, so it cannot be the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the woman wanted to do something calming and soothing at the end of the day, which is often associated with relaxing activities. Putting on soft music is a common way to create a calming atmosphere, and the other options do not fit in with the context. Dance and skate are both physical activities that are unlikely to help you relax, while opera is not typically associated with creating a relaxing environment. Therefore, the correct answer is relax.
The question is asking about where medics practice their craft when they are helping soldiers in the middle of fighting. This suggests that the location would be somewhere near or on the battlefield. The other options, such as a funeral, hospital, or safety tent, do not make sense in the context of the question.
If power is out, traffic lights may not be functioning, which can cause traffic congestion and potential accidents. Police officers are trained to direct traffic in such situations to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The other answer choices are not relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the artist is satisfied with their work, which usually results in a feeling of relaxation and contentment. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional state associated with completing a satisfactory work of art. Enlightenment and controversy are typically associated with more profound responses to creative work, while tiredness and frustration usually result from difficulties encountered during the creative process.
The context of the sentence suggests that the frisbee is currently in motion and being used in a game. Therefore, it is most likely to be in the air during play. The other options, such as outside or park, do not provide information about the location of the frisbee within the game. Roof and tree are unlikely options as they are not typically part of a frisbee game.
A "ball projectile" typically refers to a type of ammunition fired from a cannon, which is a large gun designed to launch heavy projectiles over long distances. The other options, such as a machine or a weapon, may also be capable of firing projectiles, but are not typically associated with the term "ball projectile." A battlefield may be a location where a ball projectile is used, but it is not where the projectile is shot out of. A tornado is a natural phenomenon and does not relate to the context of the question.
The phrase "sees his or her friend nearby" suggests that the person is likely to greet or acknowledge the friend in some way. The option "wave" is the most common and appropriate response in this context. "Experience life" is generalized and doesn't make sense in this context. "Cross road" is irrelevant and doesn't have any connection to meeting a friend. "Thank god" is also not related to acknowledging a friend. "Man crew" is a random set of words with no relevance to the context of the sentence.
Biting nails is often a nervous habit or behavior associated with anxiety, stress, or nervousness. This means that the person may be experiencing some level of discomfort or unease, rather than relaxation or contentment. The other options do not fit the context, as they imply positive or neutral states of mind rather than a negative or uncomfortable one.
An excavation site refers to an area where digging or excavation occurs, often for the purpose of uncovering buried objects or structures. A quarry is a type of excavation site that specifically refers to a place where rocks, minerals, or other materials are extracted from the earth. Therefore, it is more likely that a quarry would be near an excavation site rather than a shopping mall, city, or even a state like Montana. A work area could be near an excavation site if the excavation is being done for construction or industrial purposes.
The sentence suggests that the place where you would eat lots of fried foods on a stick is a location that is associated with events or gatherings where food vendors are selling a variety of fried foods. These types of events are commonly held at fairgrounds, where carnival rides and games are also found. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person mentioned has been a student for four years and is now reaching a milestone where they will no longer be a student. This milestone is usually associated with graduating from college or university, which is the act of receiving a degree or diploma for completing a course of study. The other options may be related to being a student, but they do not accurately reflect the end of the four-year period mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is sensitive to sunlight, which means she may be prone to sunburn or other negative effects of UV radiation. To protect herself from these effects, she wears thick sunscreen. The most appropriate answer, therefore, is "sun-resistant," which means she is resistant to the harmful effects of the sun. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not describe Sarah's ability to resist or protect herself from the sun.
Gambling is often associated with casinos, where people go specifically to play games of chance and bet on various outcomes. While gamblers could potentially be found at a race track or a bar, these locations are less commonly associated with gambling than casinos. "Back horses" is not a location and "building" is too vague to give any indication of where gamblers might be found.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is dressed as a clown, which is often associated with performing or entertaining. Therefore, the most logical answer would be that the person is hoping to make others happy. This is a common goal for clowns, who often perform at parties, festivals, and other events to entertain and bring joy to others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "prepare" means to get something ready for use or consumption, which indicates that the correct answer involves some form of food preparation. Going to a restaurant or getting food could involve someone else preparing the food, but it may not be the case that the person themselves is actually preparing the food. Similarly, saying grace is a religious act of giving thanks before a meal, but it does not necessarily involve preparing or consuming food in itself. Cooking food is also a form of food preparation, but it is more specific than the general act of preparing food, and therefore may not be the best answer in this context.
The sentence suggests that John and Betty are in a romantic relationship, and that they engage in a specific activity when they are alone together. Of the choices provided, kissing is the most likely activity for a romantic couple to engage in while alone together. Proposing to a woman can be done in private, but it is not an activity that a couple typically engages in together, and singing, living life, and dancing are all very broad and non-specific activities that do not fit the context of the sentence as well as kissing does.
The sentence suggests that the banana was sweet because it was "full of sugar", and yet it was green suggesting that the banana was not yet ripe. If a banana is not yet ripe, it can be hard and starchy, making it difficult to eat, and the fact that the banana was "full of sugar" suggests that it might have been cloying, which means overly sweet or sickly. Therefore, the best answer is 'cloy'. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the meat needs to be cooked for a significant amount of time, at least four hours, which suggests that it needs to be slow-cooked. Using a pot or a frying pan may not be suitable for slow cooking because the meat will be exposed to direct heat. A ham sandwich and a butcher shop are not relevant to the cooking process. Therefore, the correct answer is an oven.
The sentence suggests that John believes that understanding people better leads to a deeper sense of something. The word "compassion" is often associated with understanding and empathy towards others, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have a clear connection to the concept of understanding people better.
Thirst is a clear signal that the body needs hydration, and the most appropriate way to quench thirst is to drink water. Eating may temporarily satisfy hunger, but will not provide the necessary hydration. Sunny days and compliments are not relevant to the context of the question. "All kinds of things" is too broad and does not provide a specific solution to the person's thirst.
The sentence suggests that the friend is already fishing, which means he is likely to be catching fish. The phrase "out there" implies that the friend is in a location where fishing is possible, and the fact that he surprised the speaker suggests that he was not expected to be there. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they do not relate to fishing or being "out there."
The sentence implies that the person has long hair that can be styled into a ponytail. The only choice that relates to hair length is "cut there," which suggests that the person went to a hair salon or barbershop to have their hair trimmed or cut. The other options (such as coloring, combing, braiding, or washing) do not involve shortening the length of the hair.
Salmon are known for their anadromous lifecycle, which means they migrate from the ocean to freshwater rivers and streams to spawn. This process is essential to the survival of the species and is a well-known aspect of salmon biology. While salmon may occasionally be found in aquariums, ponds or seas, the context of the question clearly suggests that the correct answer is a freshwater habitat, which is most commonly a river.
A ring binder is a type of folder used for organizing papers, and budgets are often created and maintained in an office setting. Therefore, it is logical that a ring binder containing budgets would be found in an office. The other options do not have a strong connection to budgets or the use of a ring binder.
The sentence implies that John ate until he was full, which suggests he was at a place where food was being served in large quantities, such as a restaurant. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (e.g., dining room and cupboard are locations where food is stored, while shelf does not indicate any connection to food at all). "Stomach" is the result of John eating, not the location where he ate.
The sentence indicates that the bookend was placed on a shelf, which suggests that the location is likely to be a bookshelf. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not involve placing something on a shelf. A pair may refer to a pair of bookends, but it does not provide information about the location of the bookend. The other options, school cafeteria and library book, do not suggest a location where a bookend may be placed.
The context of the sentence suggests that Sally put newspaper on the floor due to having two dogs. This is a common practice for dog owners as the newspaper can be used to absorb any messes that the dogs make. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the squirrel is moving horizontally between two gutters, which is most likely to occur on a roof. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A park or forest would not have gutters, chipmunks are not known for crossing gutters, and muddy water would not be a viable route for a small animal like a squirrel.
Wild gazelles are a type of antelope that can be found in various habitats, but they are often associated with dry and arid regions such as the Kalahari desert. The open plain option could also be a possibility, but it is a less specific answer compared to the Kalahari desert option. The sheep pen, trophy room, and ball gown options are unlikely to be places where John might find wild gazelles.
Bleach is often used as a disinfectant and is commonly added to water to kill bacteria. The sentence suggests that there was a bacteria scare, and adding bleach to the well would be a logical step in addressing the issue. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "tropical" suggests that the sloth was likely in a warm, humid environment. The mention of Portuguese being spoken may indicate that the location is in a region where Portuguese is commonly spoken, such as Brazil, which has a large portion of the Amazon rainforest within its borders. The use of the phrase "tropical rain forest" encompasses both the warm, humid climate and the possible Portuguese-speaking region, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam's strength as a sound engineer stems from his ability to understand the world through sound, indicating that he might have a vision impairment. This would explain why he relies on sound as his primary way of perceiving the world around him. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that can be used to determine the correct answer.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about a situation where someone is away from their own home, possibly staying in a different city for work. In this scenario, the most likely option for taking a bath would be a hotel room. Hotels typically provide bathrooms with showers or bathtubs, so it makes sense that this would be the correct answer. The other options are either irrelevant (such as Greece) or clearly not viable for taking a bath (such as a public fountain).
The question implies that walking a dog has multiple benefits. One of the benefits is exercise, which can be gained from walking for a long period. Another benefit is companionship, which can be gained from spending time with a pet. The other options, such as poop and sore feet, are not inherent benefits of walking a dog but rather potential side effects. Pride and tiredness may be subjective experiences but are not directly related to the act of walking a dog.
The question asks about becoming a good writer in college, and studying literature is a common way for aspiring writers to develop their writing skills. By studying literature, students can analyze different writing styles and techniques, learn about literary traditions and movements, and hone their critical thinking skills. The other options do not relate to the topic of becoming a good writer.
The sentence suggests that Sam is not skilled at running long distances, which implies that he may struggle or tire easily if he attempted one. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person's reputation was damaged when they were exposed as a liar, which would likely result in feelings of shame and embarrassment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The main goal of work outside of the home is to earn money. This is typically the reason why individuals seek employment and is a central aspect of modern society where most people need to work to support themselves and their families. While other options may also be benefits or outcomes of working, earning money is the primary reason for most people.
An encyclopedia is a reference work that contains information on a vast range of topics. It typically provides detailed explanations and definitions of terms, and is organized alphabetically for easy access. Since the question is asking about the definition of a sloth, an encyclopedia would be the best source of information for this type of question. The other options do not have the same informational value as an encyclopedia for the purpose of looking up definitions.
The sentence suggests that the person is considering the cost of ink, which is typically used for printing. This strongly suggests that the person is talking about purchasing a new printer for a home office rather than for a car, school, work, or newspaper office. The cost of ink is often a major consideration for people who print a lot, especially in a home office setting where they may need to print documents or pictures regularly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
August is typically breeding season for many bird species, so it is likely that the birds were looking to reproduce. Building a nest and picking berries are also behaviors commonly associated with birds during breeding season. However, breathing and looking at the sky do not seem related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person wants to keep their lemonade cold to make it more refreshing. The best option for keeping a drink cold is a refrigerator, as this appliance maintains a consistent low temperature. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and do not explain how to make the lemonade more refreshing.
The question is asking for the least aggressive way to show anger. Writing a letter is a non-violent and peaceful way to express one's emotions. It allows the person to organize and communicate their thoughts without resorting to physical harm. The other options, such as releasing energy, punching or breaking a leg, involve some form of physical violence or harm, which would be considered aggressive ways to show anger. Passing sentence may also be a form of aggression, as it involves judging and punishing another person.
The question is asking where someone would be likely to see a moving airplane, which suggests that the airplane is in flight. The most likely place to see a moving airplane in flight would be in the sky, since airplanes are designed to fly in the air. While airplanes may be present at military bases, airports, or airplane hangars, these places are not necessarily associated with airplanes that are actively in motion or visible to the general public. Additionally, the spelling of "hanger" is incorrect and does not refer to a place where airplanes are typically seen.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is working a shift in a location where they are primarily standing in the kitchen. The option "restaurant" is the most logical answer as this type of workplace usually involves kitchen work and standing for long periods. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence or are unlikely scenarios.

Rain is a type of weather phenomenon that occurs when water droplets fall from clouds towards the Earth's surface. Snow is also a type of precipitation but differs from rain in that it forms at colder temperatures and as ice crystals. Disneyland and forest do not have any relevance to the context of the question. Air is a general term that refers to the mixture of gases present in the Earth's atmosphere, which includes the components that make up weather systems like rain.
Since John wants to reach a large and diverse group from many places, airports are a logical choice. Airports are typically populated by people from different geographic regions and cultural backgrounds, providing an opportunity for John to distribute his religious tracts to a wide and varied audience. The other options are unlikely to have the same level of diversity and reach as an airport.
The sentence indicates that the person is using a metal detector to search for a ring, which implies that the ring has been lost and not found. The context also suggests that the ring was lost while the person was pulling weeds, further supporting the idea that the ring was misplaced or lost in some way. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Alcohol is known to impair cognitive and physical abilities, leading to the state of inebriation. Vomiting and frequent urination may also be side effects of alcohol consumption, but they do not necessarily always happen. Hilarity and singing may be common reactions to alcohol, but they are not universal and do not necessarily always happen after consuming alcohol.
Conductors are typically associated with leading orchestras, and are commonly seen raising and flailing their arms in the air to signal the musicians. This action helps to keep the musicians in sync and on tempo. While a conductor may also lead an opera or choir, the specific reference to flailing arms in the air suggests that the correct answer is orchestra, where this action is most commonly seen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
While the other options may indicate different types of reactions from the audience, applause is the most commonly associated expression with liking a performance. Audience members typically clap their hands together to show appreciation for the performer, which is why applause is the correct answer. Smiling or a standing ovation may also indicate a positive reaction, but they are less commonly associated with expressing enjoyment of a performance. Music does not indicate an audience reaction at all, while a grimace is a negative expression that suggests dislike or discomfort.

The question is asking for a negative response that someone might have towards a talkative person, indicating that the person does not want to engage in conversation. The phrase "not wanting to have someone talking to them" suggests that the person may have an adverse or negative reaction to the talkative person, perhaps due to annoyance or discomfort. The other options, such as increased understanding or rumors spread, do not make sense in the context of not wanting to talk to someone. Boredom or a headache may be a possible outcome of having to deal with a talkative person, but the phrase "not wanting to have someone talking to them" implies a more active response.
The sentence implies that the man is experiencing some sort of psychological distress or guilt after committing murder, which is typically associated with a guilty conscience. This feeling may be intensified by the fact that he can still hear the victim's heart beating, a sign that the experience is still fresh in his mind. The other options do not directly relate to the theme of guilt or regret.
The sentence suggests that the characteristic being discussed pertains to a dominant sex within a species. In many species of animals, males are often the dominant ones, meaning they possess traits that allow them to take charge of the group, fight for mating rights, and protect their offspring. The other options are not commonly associated with dominance within a species.
A broken keyboard is unlikely to be found in a school, music store, thrift store, or office, as these locations do not typically deal with the disposal of electronic waste. A landfill, on the other hand, is a common destination for discarded keyboards and other electronics. This knowledge allows us to choose the correct answer from the list of options.
The sentence suggests that while a computer is capable of processing information and making choices, there is something that it cannot do that is different from these functions. It is unlikely that a computer has the capability to have religious beliefs or faith, which explains why it cannot believe in God. The other options are all functions or capabilities that a computer is typically able to perform.
The sentence suggests that koalas are not found in the environment that James mistakenly went to. Since Siberia is a cold, arctic region, it is unlikely that koalas would be found there. Therefore, Siberia is the correct answer. The other options - jungle, great outdoors, Queensland, and wilderness - do not provide any clear indication of whether koalas can or cannot be found in those environments.
The question suggests that the item being stored does not need to be kept cold, which rules out the option of a refrigerator. This leaves the options of cupboard, corner, night stand, and bookstore. However, a shelf inside a cupboard is a common place to store non-perishable food items such as dry goods and canned goods, making the correct answer cupboard. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the child only learned music through hearing it, indicating that they did not have access to sheet music or any form of written notation. This connection is particularly clear in the phrase "never even seen it," which implies a lack of exposure to music in written form. Therefore, the correct answer is "written on paper." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "stabbing to death the buck" suggests that the animal was wounded and bleeding, which would also explain why it was "everywhere." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that parents encourage their kids to play baseball for a specific reason. While the other options could be reasons why parents discourage their kids from playing baseball, they are not reasons why parents encourage their kids to play baseball. "Fun to play" is often cited as a reason why parents encourage their kids to participate in sports, especially at a young age. Playing baseball can also help kids develop important skills, such as teamwork and hand-eye coordination.
The sentence suggests that the bungalow was located in a densely populated area where people could easily walk by and interact with those inside. This is a characteristic typically associated with neighborhoods, where it is common to see people walking, biking, or just hanging out on the street. The other options, such as suburbs or woods, do not have this same kind of bustling energy or pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.
The sentence uses conditional language, suggesting that having a head is a prerequisite for having a certain ability. Out of the given choices, "point" is the only one that makes logical sense in this context, as it is a common ability associated with having a head. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is referring to a piece of furniture or structure that has foot rails. The options "bookcase" and "repair shop" do not fit this description. "Toolbox" and "toolkit" are possible options, but the fact that the person always kept a screwdriver behind it implies that it is a place they frequent often and casually - this does not fit the context of a toolbox or toolkit, which are typically stored away and used for specific tasks. "Bar" is the best option as it is a place where foot rails are common, and the casual use of a screwdriver could indicate that the person frequents bars often enough to keep a screwdriver there.
The question suggests that the saucer is not in use and is being kept for display purposes. A china cabinet is typically used to store and display delicate, decorative dishes, and is therefore a logical location to keep a saucer for visual enjoyment. The other options do not offer a space for displaying items, with the exception of a tea room, which is not a common fixture in most homes.
The question is about the purpose or goal of talking, and the choice that best fits that context is "attempting to communicate." Talking is a form of communication, and the act of talking implies an attempt to convey meaning or information to others. While some of the other choices may be related to talking in some way (e.g., "getting to know people" may be a reason why someone wants to engage in conversation), they do not capture the main purpose of why people talk, which is to communicate.
Tilling the soil is the first step in preparing the ground for planting crops. When soil is tilled, it is loosened and aerated, which makes it easier for the roots of the plants to grow and absorb nutrients. Planting seeds, producing food, farming land, and growing corn are all part of the process of farming, but none of them would be possible without first preparing the soil by tilling it.
The sentence suggests that taking the hill would lead to an advantage, which implies a positive outcome. Historically, taking high ground in battles has often been a strategic advantage, as it provides a better vantage point for surveying the battlefield and launching attacks. This would suggest that the likely result of taking the hill would be victory. The other options do not necessarily follow logically from the context of the sentence.
The word "genius" is usually used to describe someone with exceptional intelligence and talent in a particular area. Therefore, it makes sense for the answer to be "exceptional" as it implies someone who is beyond ordinary in all subjects. The other choices do not accurately capture the idea of someone who is exceptionally talented in all subjects.
The sentence mentions that the potato was sliced and fried, which is a common method of cooking french fries. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, mentioning that the potato was sliced implies that it was being prepared as a side dish or snack, which further supports the idea that the cook was making french fries.
The sentence suggests that the person is happy, which is commonly associated with the emotion of joyfulness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase "best things in life" is subjective and could vary from person to person, while a slim waist, own house, and comfortable shoes may contribute to overall happiness but do not necessarily guarantee it.
The sentence suggests that the person had a goal and had finally saved enough money to achieve that goal. The word "satisfaction" implies a feeling of accomplishment or contentment, which is a common emotion when someone achieves a long-desired goal. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the bathroom is located in a place where multiple people have access to it, such as a hotel. The fact that it is cleaned every day implies that it is a public bathroom that is used frequently. The other options, such as a neighbor's house or a flat, may also have shared bathrooms, but the context of the sentence does not support those options.
The question implies that the girl desires to improve her appearance. The available choices all describe physical features or states of being, with "beautiful" being the most commonly used descriptor for attractive appearances of women. The other choices ("pretty," "pleasing," "handsome," "gorgeous," "pregnant") do not accurately reflect the implication of the question.
The sentence implies that the victim experienced physical harm as a result of being punched, which could manifest as pain, a bruise, or both. However, the use of the word "find" suggests that the victim may have noticed a physical mark or injury on their body, which would most likely be a bruise since it is a visible sign of trauma caused by blunt force. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence implies that the process of watering the seeds after planting them in the ground results in something growing, which is likely to be plants. Additionally, the other choices don't fit with the logic of the sentence. Harvesting implies a later stage of plant development, dying and feeling sad are opposite of the desired outcome of gardening, and "plants" is a redundant option.
The sentence suggests that the bears in the specific section that the guide is referring to are a potential danger. The word "safe" implies that there is a risk of harm, so it is likely that the bears are known to attack or pose a threat in some way. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "easily spooked" implies that the bears are more scared of the humans than the other way around, while "in danger" refers to the bears themselves being in danger rather than posing a threat to humans. "Precarious" is too vague, and "harmful" could refer to any number of dangers in the area.
Delicatessens are typically located in urban areas with high foot traffic, making a large city the most likely answer. Michigan and hometown do not provide enough information about the specific location of a deli, while shop and mall could potentially be locations for a deli, but are not as commonly associated with this type of establishment as a large city.
The sentence suggests that not all video games are just for fun and entertainment, but some serve a different purpose. The option "educational" makes sense in this context because there are many video games designed to teach specific skills or subjects, such as math, history, or language. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the idea that some video games can be more than just fun.
Plants usually start from seeds planted in the ground, which provides them with the necessary nutrients, moisture, and anchorage to grow. The other options do not make sense in the context of plant growth: "at the beginning" is too vague, "surface of earth" is redundant with "ground," "windowsill" implies that the plants are already grown, and "park" does not provide the necessary conditions for plant growth.
The fact that the man is reading the Bible before talking to a priest suggests that he is seeking spiritual guidance or advice, which is often done during confession. Confession is a sacrament in the Catholic Church in which a person confesses their sins to a priest, who then absolves them of those sins. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to the end of summer and what happens next for a child. The most likely scenario is that the child will be returning to school after the summer break, making "go back to school" the correct answer. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence or are not as likely to happen after the summer.
Bald eagles are primarily found in North America, and Canada is one of the countries in the northern part of this continent. Bald eagle preserves are areas where these birds are protected and their habitats are conserved. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John's friends did not treat him with respect, and that as a result he suffered something at their hands. "Belittlement" means to make someone feel small or unimportant, which fits the context of the sentence. "Humiliate," "embarrassed," and "irreverence" are all similar in meaning but do not precisely match the context of the sentence. "Contempt" means disdain or disrespect, but it is less specific than "belittlement" and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context.
The question is asking for a negative characteristic of a real estate agent, and stealing, exaggerating, and covering up are all unethical or illegal behaviors that would not be associated with a reputable agent. Charming is a positive trait that a real estate agent might possess, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Incompetence, on the other hand, would lead to poor performance and negative outcomes for clients, making it a likely choice for a bad real estate agent.
The context of the sentence suggests that a hurricane can have a catastrophic impact on a city. The term "disaster" is commonly used to describe events that cause significant damage or loss of life, and hurricanes are notorious for their ability to bring destruction to the areas they hit. The other options, such as rain or tornadoes, may be associated with hurricanes, but they do not capture the full impact that hurricanes can have on a city.
The question asks for a location where fish can be found other than a refrigerator or a market, indicating that the answer should be a natural or outdoor location. A stream is a place where fish are commonly found swimming in the wild, making it the best answer. Mirach, on the other hand, is not a known location for fish. Aquariums are man-made places where fish can be kept, but not a location where they can be found in the wild.
When a vehicle experiences a breakdown, it is typically pulled over to the side of the road to avoid obstructing traffic. The other answer choices do not provide a likely scenario for where a broken-down automobile would be found.
The sentence suggests that James did not want to display his rug but his wife insisted on it. Therefore, he compromised and placed it under something. The most likely option for this would be a table, as it is a common item that can be used to display objects, and it would also hide the rug from view to some degree. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the pond is surrounded by tall buildings, which would not be a typical feature of a forest. Forests are typically associated with tall trees and natural surroundings, rather than man-made structures like tall buildings. The other options are all plausible locations for a pond with tall buildings around it.
The use of the phrase "lit up" implies that the host was excited about someone arriving, which makes the most sense in the context of welcoming guests. The other options do not fit the description of someone who is excitedly waiting for guests to arrive, such as mounting a horse or offering food to guests.
The sentence suggests that there are multiple dentists located in one place that can be visited, which is commonly found in a dental office. The other options, such as Las Vegas or a garden, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The phone book and town could potentially have multiple dentists, but they do not specifically mention a location where they can be visited.
The sentence describes a performance that involves lions, elephants, and acrobats, which are all commonly associated with a circus. A circus is a type of entertainment that features various acts or performances, including animal performances and acrobatics. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that eating hamburger too fast without swallowing has negative consequences. One likely consequence in this scenario is choking, as hamburger is a solid food that requires proper chewing and swallowing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James was someone who enjoyed using violence, but his attitude changed after something happened to him. The phrase "when it was him that it was" implies that he experienced the effects of violence firsthand, which is most likely to have happened if he got injured. None of the other options offer a plausible explanation for what could have happened to James to make him change his tune about violence.
The sentence suggests that there are some children who wish they were grown ups so that they could have more freedom to do whatever they want. This is a common desire among children who feel restricted by the rules and limitations placed upon them by adults. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that spirits are haunting a location that is outside, which rules out options like a bar or liquor cabinet. The reference to a funeral home and haunted house may seem plausible, but the specific mention of "spirits" seems to suggest that the haunting is occurring in a place where people have been laid to rest, making a cemetary the most likely answer.
The question suggests that lying constantly has a negative consequence, and the opposite would therefore be a positive consequence. Feeling guilty is a common consequence of lying, and it would be the opposite of a positive consequence. The other choices do not fit the context of the question or are not opposite in meaning to lying.
The sentence implies that the act of continuously applying for jobs without receiving any responses can result in negative emotions. The phrase "no calls come back" suggests that the person is not being contacted for interviews or job offers, which can be disheartening and frustrating. The options "hope" and "happiness" are unlikely because the context implies a negative outcome. "Working hard" may be a result of the frustration, but it is not the direct consequence being described.
The sentence suggests that there is something growing in a field that can be swatted at using a stick. The other options, such as woods, forest, bicycle spokes, or home, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Grass, however, is a common plant that grows in fields, and people may use sticks to swat away bugs or weeds from the grass.
The context suggests that the question is asking about the location where computers are used for sorting. While computers are used in a variety of settings, including universities, labyrinths, and large cities, the most likely location for computer sorting is the post office. This is because the post office is responsible for sorting and delivering a large volume of mail and packages, which requires complex sorting systems that rely on computers. MIT is a prestigious university that is known for its technology programs, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer.
The question is asking for the name of a state that comes first alphabetically and has a high number of people who play the fiddle. The choices include two states that start with the letter "A," Alabama and Alaska. Since Alabama comes first alphabetically, it is the correct answer. The other options, such as "violin case" and "orchestra," do not pertain to the question and can be eliminated as possible answers.
Using "please" when requesting something is a polite and socially accepted way of making a request. The other options do not make sense in the context of asking someone to entertain you. "Hot" and "happy" are adjectives that do not fit the context, while "liked" and "now" do not express the request for entertainment.
Standing in line for an extended period of time can cause discomfort and strain on the feet, leading to pain. Frustration and anger are emotional responses to the situation, while lime scale and order do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence.
Cats are known for their climbing and perching abilities, which allows them to survey their surroundings and feel safe. They also enjoy basking in sunlight, which makes the option "beam of sunlight" somewhat tempting. However, the sentence specifically asks about the type of area, and high places (such as trees, shelves, or the top of furniture) are more commonly associated with cats than any of the other options.
The sentence suggests that the pit being referred to is likely the pit of a fruit, such as a cherry or peach. It also suggests that the pit has been burned, which could potentially occur from a backyard bonfire or grill. The other options - hungry, mine - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that eating hamburgers in excess can have negative long-term consequences for a person's health. This is a common understanding, as diets high in saturated fats and processed meats have been linked to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems. The other options (death, gas, McDonald's, nausea) are not necessarily direct consequences of eating hamburgers in excess, and therefore do not fit as the answer.
John wanted grapes, which are typically not found in a kitchen, fruit basket or bowl of fruit at home. Fields may have grapes, but it is unlikely that John would have access to one. A farmers market is a likely place to find a variety of fruits and vegetables, including grapes.
The sentence suggests that the racers are preparing to begin a competition, which typically starts with all participants lining up at a designated starting point. The other options, such as podium or train, are not typically associated with the beginning of a race. The option "ready emotionally and physically" may be necessary for a successful race, but it does not address the specific action the racers need to take at the moment.
The context suggests that the person is getting their paper back with corrections, which is a common occurrence in a classroom setting. Conferences typically involve discussions with others and may not involve receiving papers back with corrections. A bench, cabinet, and notebook do not have any clear connection to receiving a paper back with corrections.
The context of the question suggests that the emphasis is on where humans are able to see the stars, rather than where they exist in the universe. The most likely option is the night sky, as this is where stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth. Outer space, constellation, galaxy, and universe are all related to stars, but they are not necessarily connected to the ability of humans to see them.
The word "exercise" implies physical activity, and a ball is commonly used in sports or fitness activities. The options "playground" and "toy store" suggest a more recreational use of a ball, while "bank" and "bowling alley" have no apparent connection to balls or exercise equipment. "Gymnasium" is the most appropriate answer as it is a place dedicated to physical fitness and likely to have a variety of exercise equipment, including balls for different types of workouts.
Beans are known to cause gas in some people due to their high fiber content. This can lead to discomfort and bloating. While beans can provide energy, the sentence suggests that the focus is on the potential negative side effects of eating them for breakfast. Fullness and stomach ache could be potential outcomes, but they are not specifically tied to beans like gas and indigestion are.
The other options do not make sense in the context of replying to something. "Give" and "mute" do not apply to replying, "email" is a method of sending a reply, but not the action of replying itself, and "question" is not related to the action of replying. "Send" is the most fitting answer as it refers to the action of transmitting the reply to the recipient.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is hesitant about doing something that is perceived as bad. The word "choice" indicates that she may feel like she doesn't have much control over the situation and is forced to make a decision that she doesn't want to make. The other options are not connected to the context of the sentence and do not help to answer the question.
The sentence mentions that Sam's living situation fits a "stereotype" and that "everyone from out of state thinks he's a cowboy." This suggests that the state he lives in has a strong association with cowboys and ranching culture. Texas is famously known for its ranches and cowboys, so it is the most likely location where Sam might live based on the given information. The other options do not have as strong of an association with cowboys or ranching culture.
The sentence suggests that she was going to bed, which is typically associated with trying to fall asleep. The other options do not necessarily relate directly to going to bed at 11 at night, as someone might relax or rest without necessarily going to bed, for example. Additionally, "dreaming of" and "laziness" do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not suggest any specific reason for going to bed at that time.
Mouthwash is often provided in little paper cups at dentist's offices, where patients are asked to rinse their mouths before or after a dental procedure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The flu is a viral illness that primarily affects the respiratory system, which is located in the body. While it can cause some digestive symptoms (nausea, diarrhea), it is not primarily associated with the stomach. Airplanes and hospitals may be places where people are more likely to come into contact with the flu virus, but they are not causes of the illness itself. The elderly population may be more susceptible to serious complications from the flu, but this does not necessarily mean that they are more likely to contract it.
The sentence mentions that the little girl smiled, which suggests that what she saw was something positive or beautiful. The option "happy" could be a possibility, but the sentence also mentions that the little girl pointed out something specific, which makes the option "make others happy too" less likely. The option "cry" and "frown" have negative connotations and would not fit with the positive tone of the sentence. The option "rainbow" is a common thing that people point out, especially children, because of its bright and colorful appearance.
The mention of a Menorah and lighting candles is a Jewish tradition, specifically during the holiday of Hanukkah. Hanukkah is primarily celebrated in synagogues, which makes it likely that the sentence is referring to a synagogue and not any of the other options. The mention of "everybody" suggests that multiple people were present to witness the lighting of the Menorah, which is commonly done as a group activity during Hanukkah services.
Playing basketball is a popular recreational activity that many people enjoy for fun and exercise. It is not typically associated with negative experiences such as pain or injuries, although those can happen. "Crazy" does not make sense in this context, and "sweating" is a common result of physical activity, but not the reason someone would choose to play basketball.
Revolving doors are commonly found in large public buildings, particularly in shopping malls and department stores. The other options, such as earth and New York, do not make sense contextually, while a bank may have a revolving door but may not have millions of them.
The use of the term "floor" indicates that the structure being referred to has multiple levels or stories. This is a common feature of skyscrapers, which are tall buildings designed to maximize the use of vertical space. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with tall buildings or multiple stories.
the sentence suggests that the context is about a range where bald eagles can be found. The Rocky Mountains are known to have a significant population of these birds, and this mountain range spans across many northern states and Canadian provinces. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
A mountain is a type of hill that is typically taller than other types of hills and often has a pointed or peaked shape. Mountains are typically formed through geological processes such as tectonic activity or volcanic eruptions. The other options, such as flat land, pool, valley, and flat ground, are not types of hills, and do not accurately match the definition of a hill provided in the question.
Ice is a solid form of water that melts when heated. The sun is a source of heat, so it is likely that ice will melt and turn into water when exposed to the sun. The other options do not relate to the behavior of ice when exposed to heat.
The context of the sentence implies that executives sit on the top floor of a building. The options "office building" and "tall building" are closely related to the context of the sentence, as executives are often associated with offices and the top floor of a tall building can be seen as a prestigious location. The options "chair", "apartment building", and "apartment highrise" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people are socializing at a bar, and the bartender is serving cocktails. The most likely action that the bartender would take is to mix the cocktails since that is their primary job function. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
A cash register is typically where money is kept in a business setting, making it a likely safe place to keep money. Pockets and on the ground are not secure locations, and a casino or supermarket may have higher risks of theft or loss. Therefore, the answer must be cash register.
A sheep during its first year of life is commonly referred to as a lamb. This is a well-known term in the field of animal husbandry and is used to differentiate between the different stages of a sheep's life. The other options either have no connection to sheep or are incorrect terms for a young sheep.
The sentence suggests that not eating enough food has negative consequences on the body, including the stomach. This is supported by common knowledge that a lack of proper nutrition can lead to discomfort, pain, and potentially more serious health issues. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the question.
The question is asking about the proper way to tie a bow. The word "correct" indicates that there is a specific method or technique that should be followed. The other options - light, lightly, loosely, and slowly - do not provide any information about the proper way to tie a bow.
Log cabins are typically heated with wood-burning stoves or fireplaces, which suggests that the most likely heat source would be fire. The other options are not typically associated with heating a log cabin, as a house or home could refer to any type of dwelling and a bedroom or sun is not a source of heat on its own.
The sentence suggests that the man had a space in his house that he referred to as a "man cave," which is typically a space reserved for men to relax and entertain themselves in. The fact that the space also included a sofa bed suggests that it doubled as a guest room, which is a common practice for homeowners who want to make the most of their space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The term "athlete" typically refers to someone who regularly participates in sports and physical activity, so it's safe to assume that the correct answer is related to sports. Option 2 contradicts the idea of an athlete, as they would not be expected to rest excessively. Option 3 is too generic and could apply to anyone, not just athletes. Option 4 is inappropriate and unethical, as not all athletes take steroids, and it suggests that cheating is an acceptable practice. Option 5 is ridiculous and doesn't make any sense in the context of the question. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "play sports."
In a typical doorway, the object that would be used to open or close the door is the doorknob. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they either do not relate to a specific part of the doorway or describe objects that would not typically be found in a doorway.
The sentence states that studying requires using multiple sources, which implies that the task involves collecting information from different places. Gathering information is a common step in completing a project, as it helps to create a foundation of knowledge that can be used to develop new ideas or solutions. The other options do not relate to the main idea of the sentence, and are therefore incorrect.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about the actions of people who own restaurants. Owning a restaurant involves running a business where food is prepared and served to customers for a profit, so the answer that best fits the context is "selling food." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the conductor and performers are singing in German, and this is a clue that the correct answer is related to classical music. The options "subway" and "broadway" are not likely to be correct, as they are not traditionally associated with classical music. "Listen to music" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information. The options "orchestra" and "opera" both seem plausible, but since the sentence mentions singing in German, "opera" is the more likely answer because operas are typically performed in their original language.
The sentence suggests that the person is performing with a musical instrument (a harp), and that it is their first performance. This implies that the person is likely a musician who is just starting out in their career, and may not have played in a large venue before. A concert hall is a common location for musical performances, particularly for classical or orchestral music, which are both genres that could potentially feature a harp. The other options do not make as much sense, as they do not align with the idea of a formal performance in a significant venue.
The sentence suggests that running is a physically demanding and rigorous workout that causes the body to perspire, which is commonly referred to as sweating. The other options, such as dehydration or trip and fall, are not directly related to the physical exertion of running. Exercise and breathing hard are both results of running, but they are not specific to the question of what running works up.
The sentence suggests that birds are known for doing something that is related to their physical activity. Birds are known for their ability to fly, which requires a great deal of physical movement. They are also constantly on the move as they migrate to different parts of the world. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that having faith in religion has both positive and negative aspects. Having faith can provide comfort and a sense of purpose, but it can also lead to division and hatred. The other options do not address the complex nature of faith in religion.
The sentence suggests that the object being discussed is not suitable for a canoe, which implies that it is shallow or not deep enough to comfortably navigate with a canoe. The other options do not provide any explanation for why it would be too shallow for a canoe.
The sentence suggests that the tickets were supposed to arrive by a certain time but did not, leading to frustration for Sally who had been waiting in line for a long time. The fact that the line had not moved indicates that there may be some kind of delay, which would explain why the tickets had not arrived yet. The other options, such as being annoyed or sprinting, do not provide a clear explanation for the situation described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman was famous for her needlepoint, which requires the use of a frame to hold the fabric taut while stitching. The fact that she grabbed a round wooden frame suggests that the needlepoint project she was working on was also round. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the family photos were stored in a high and dusty location that required the person to climb a ladder to reach them. The most logical option that fits this description is the attic, which is a common storage space located high up in a house. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person decided to have lunch because it was the logical thing to do, implying that they were hungry and need sustenance to continue with their day. The other options may also be possible, but they do not fit the logical decision making that the sentence describes.
Wine is a type of alcoholic beverage that is made from fermented grapes. Grapes are crushed and the juice is left to ferment with yeast, which converts the sugar into alcohol. The other options, such as beer and cider, are made from grains and apples respectively, while a distillery is a place where alcohol is distilled, but does not refer to a specific type of alcohol. Plane is not related to alcohol at all.
A bassoon is a classical instrument commonly used in orchestral music. The options "make music" and "high school band" are too general and do not specify a particular setting where a bassoon may be played. A cricket stadium does not typically host musical performances, so it can be eliminated. The option "symphony" is similar to "orchestra" but generally refers to a specific type of musical composition, whereas "orchestra" refers to the group of musicians who perform the music. Therefore, the correct answer is "orchestra."
The sentence indicates that Randy's lack of contribution to the household chores is causing his wife to have more work, which is causing her stress. This stress may lead to arguments between the couple, as they may have disagreements about the division of labor in the household. The other options, such as asthma or boredom, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A double edged razor is a type of shaving razor that has a razor blade on each side of the razor head. It is commonly sold in stores that specialize in personal care products, such as drug stores and pharmacies. While shaving kits may also contain a double edged razor, this answer choice is less specific than drug store and could refer to a variety of products. The option shower is unlikely as it is not a common place to purchase razor blades.
The sentence implies that spending most of one's time resting is not necessarily a bad thing, and in fact may lead to feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. "Laziness" and "doing nothing" have negative connotations and suggest a lack of productivity or motivation, while "relaxation" suggests a deliberate effort to unwind and destress. "Falling asleep" implies that the person is constantly dozing off, which is not necessarily the same as resting. "Well rested" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to feeling refreshed and energized after a period of rest.
Statues are often displayed in museums as works of art, historical artifacts, or cultural representations. While some statues may also be found in large cities or outside of churches, the most common place to view a variety of statues in one location would be a museum. Amusement parks are not typically known for their display of statues, and New York City is too broad of a category to be a clear answer.
The phrase "go to sleep" is often used as a command to encourage someone to rest their body and mind by sleeping. Therefore, the answer that best fits this context is "rest up." The other options do not accurately reflect the purpose of the command, which is to encourage rest and relaxation.
The sentence states that the person won a prize for hitting a bottle, which suggests that they were engaged in some kind of target shooting activity. Having a good aim would be an important skill for this kind of activity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Art books are typically found in places that are dedicated to art, such as museums, galleries, or art libraries. While it is possible to find art books in other places like schools or bedrooms, the fact that the question specifies "on a shelf or two" suggests that it is asking about a collection of books that is organized and displayed in a cohesive manner, which is more likely to be found in a museum or gallery setting. The other options, such as a cabinet or cupboard, are more commonly used for storing items that are not displayed for public viewing.
The sentence indicates that Billy put the product on display because he believed it would attract people's attention. The phrase "great attraction" also suggests that Billy thought the product would draw people's interest. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
Lizards are known to be able to climb vertical surfaces, and tree trunks are a common habitat for many species of lizards. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for lizards to live in, as they may not be able to access or survive in those areas. Undergrowth may be too low for some species, swimming pools are not natural habitats for lizards, deserts may be too hot and dry, and front porches are unlikely to provide the necessary resources for lizards to live there.
The sentence suggests that learning about the world and what is good in it will likely result in a positive experience. The option "pleasure" is the only one that fits this description. The other options are negative and do not seem to relate to the idea of learning about the world and what is good in it.
The sentence suggests that the condiments need to be separated from each other to prevent them from combining, which implies the need for individual containers. Using a cup or placing them on the table may not provide enough separation between the condiments, while a pantry is not a typical location for storing condiments. A refrigerator could also work, but it does not necessarily imply separation unless individual containers are used.
In a work context, a meeting typically refers to a gathering of colleagues or coworkers to exchange information, discuss ideas, make decisions, or solve problems. Meetings can take place in person or online, but the sentence does not suggest that the gathering is specifically online or internet-based. The option "break" refers to a pause from work, which is not related to exchanging information. "Manual" refers to a book or document that provides instruction or information, which is not related to a gathering of people.
The word "municipalities" suggests that we are talking about towns or cities, and historically, many towns had a designated churchyard or cemetery for burials. Personal homes would not be a logical choice for a public cemetery, and "most cities" and "populated area" are too broad and vague. "Field" could be a possibility, but it would not be as common as a churchyard in most municipalities.
In an interview, it is common for the interviewer and interviewee to sit facing each other. This allows for eye contact and better communication between the two parties. Round-table discussions typically involve multiple people sitting around a circular table, while "gather together" and "get angry" have no relevance to the context of an interview. "Believe in god" may be a personal belief or preference, but it does not relate to the physical positioning of people in an interview setting.
Silicone is often stored in tubes, as it is frequently used as a sealant or adhesive in the construction and automotive industries. While it may be used for artificial breasts, storing it in that context is not common or typical. Silicone is not typically stored in a bag, hardware store, or contact lens.
The sentence implies that the task involves recording something on an old answering machine. The most common medium used for recording on an old answering machine is a cassette tape, which is inserted into the machine to record and play back messages. The other options, such as a disket, recorder, or spell checker, do not have any clear connection to answering machines or recording messages.
The sentence suggests that the person played cards at the casino, but it does not specify their motivation for doing so. One possible reason is to have fun, as playing cards can be an enjoyable social activity. While it is also possible to win money or break even by playing cards, the sentence does not indicate that this was the person's intention. Wasting time or losing money are negative outcomes of gambling, and the sentence does not suggest that the person was trying to do either of these things.
Empowerment is the process of giving someone the authority or confidence to take control of their life or situation. If someone does not feel empowered, they may feel discouraged or disheartened because they do not have the ability to make decisions or control their own life. The other options, such as forbid, prohibit, and ban, refer to preventing something from happening rather than describing a feeling. Give up suggests surrendering, but does not necessarily describe the feeling of lacking empowerment.
The sentence suggests that hitting a person with a stick would cause some kind of physical harm, which is commonly associated with pain. It is logical to assume that being hit with a stick would cause discomfort and possibly injury, which would lead a person to suffer pain. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the physical consequences of being hit with a stick.
The sentence implies that the person is looking for a place to go shopping in a dense urban area. A downtown area typically has a variety of stores and shopping options within close proximity, making it a good choice for someone looking to shop in a city setting. Detroit is a specific city, not a suggestion for a shopping location. An elevator and workplace do not offer shopping opportunities, and a mall may not be located within an urban area.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is unsure of what Dane has planned for her and is contemplating her response to this uncertainty. The options "new insights," "enlightenment," and "speak" don't fit with the context of the sentence. "Hesitation" could be a possible answer, but it is not definitive. "Action," however, fits well as it suggests that Sarah may have to take action at some point, but is currently unable to do so due to her uncertainty.
The sentence suggests that quitting work and going back to school is a way for some people to improve or enhance themselves in some way. This could be through gaining new skills or knowledge, improving career prospects, or simply for personal growth and development. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Josh's mother recognized his love for learning and wanted to support him in that interest. The most logical way to support a child who loves to learn is to teach them new things. Ordering Chinese takeaway or quitting do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while remembering information or forgetting do not contribute to the idea of actively supporting Josh's love of learning.
The sentence suggests that James is not known to the people mentioned, but is known to the speaker. Therefore, the correct answer is "known person". The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about what an animal does when it becomes old, which suggests that it is referring to the behavior of animals in their natural habitats. When animals become old, they often leave their homes or territories in search of a new place to live, as they may no longer be able to fend off predators or compete with younger members of their species. This behavior is commonly observed in many species, such as elephants, wolves, and birds. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A terrarium is a container used to keep and display plants and small animals, including snakes. It is designed to mimic a natural environment and provide shelter and hiding places for the animals inside. Therefore, it is likely that a snake would easily be hidden in a terrarium, compared to the other options provided such as a living room or an outdoor forest. Kew gardens and tropical forests are also unlikely options as they are known for being well-manicured and maintained, making it less likely for a snake to hide there.
The sentence suggests that the woman is experiencing embarrassment due to her comical falls on the ice. This would make it likely that she is growing sick of being laughed at by others. Hair pulling, contact with, lacerations, and injury do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lighting a match in a dark tunnel is not likely to start a fire, as there is likely nothing combustible in the immediate vicinity. The primary purpose of lighting a match in this context would be to provide illumination, as matches emit a small but bright flame. Heat is a byproduct of the flame, but not the primary reason for lighting the match. "Make fire" and "frustration" are unlikely choices, as lighting a match is a well-known method of creating a flame.
The sentence suggests that the person has a lot of money, which is commonly associated with gambling and casinos. The mention of visiting a desert may also hint towards a specific location such as Las Vegas, which is known for its desert location and numerous casinos. The other options such as a bank account, race track, supermarket, and art show do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is feeling cold and needs warmth. One way that the fire can help is by providing heat that can warm up the person's hands, which are typically the first parts of the body to get cold. The other options either do not relate to the context of the sentence or are negative (e.g. hurt people).
The sentence indicates that the matter inside a can of soda is being described. Since soda is a beverage, it is in a liquid state. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "lawyers" suggests that the answer should be related to their profession or workplace. The option "office building" is the most relevant choice as it is a common location for lawyers to work from. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as signing documents and going to court are activities that lawyers do, rather than places they use. Apartments are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the employer has a preference regarding when an employee plans their vacation. "Free time" is a logical choice as it implies that the employee is not taking time off during important work-related events, such as meetings. "Organization" and "imagination" do not make sense in this context, and "money" is not relevant to the timing of the vacation.
The sentence suggests that John has mold in his house, which can be found in damp and dark places. Carpets are a common place for mold growth since they can hold moisture, while cellars are often damp and poorly ventilated. The other options, such as jello or a refrigerator, are unlikely places for mold to grow.
The context indicates that the two people involved in the affair were motivated by their strong feelings for each other, as they were willing to risk causing harm to others in pursuit of their love. The other options are not as closely related to the context; marriage and fidelity suggest loyalty and commitment, scandal implies negative attention, and relationship may not capture the intensity of emotions driving the affair.
The context suggests that James was at a wild event where drugs were being passed around, and it was likely a one-time event since he didn't know what drugs he took and it was the "last time." The most likely event where this scenario could occur is a concert or music festival, where people often engage in drug use. The other options do not fit the context or suggest a more controlled environment (like a doctor's office or university).
Heart tests are often conducted during routine check-ups to assess the overall health of the heart. Stress tests are one type of heart test that is commonly used to measure how the heart responds to physical activity or stress. The other options do not have any clear connection to heart tests or check-ups.
The sentence implies that the man believes that sitting alone in silence helps him to think deeply and gain a better understanding of various topics. "Insights" refers to these moments of clarity or discovery, which the man believes he is able to achieve when he is alone with his thoughts. The other options don't fit as well with the context of the sentence - anxiety and happiness are emotions, while wisdom and inspiration are more abstract concepts that don't necessarily relate to the act of sitting alone.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to academic performance. Studying is a commonly recognized method for students to improve their understanding of academic subjects and to perform better on exams, resulting in better grades. While studying can also increase knowledge and inspiration, these options are not the most immediate and direct results of studying. Money and higher intelligence are not mentioned in the context of the sentence.
A portable light source is a device that can be moved around easily and used to illuminate dark areas or spaces. The most common portable light source is a flashlight or torch, which is a small handheld device that emits a beam of light when switched on. The other options listed, such as books, house, falling down, and hallway, do not have any obvious connection to the concept of a portable light source.
The sentence suggests that the person is quick to adapt to challenges but struggles specifically in relationships. The word "alacrity" means eagerness and enthusiasm, which contrasts with the negative connotations of the options listed. "Disinclination" means a lack of willingness or desire to do something, which fits with the context of struggling in relationships. The other options all suggest a lack of enthusiasm or interest in general, which is not specific enough to relationships.
The sentence suggests that a sharp blade is necessary to cut through something, which is a characteristic commonly associated with knives. Knives are commonly used for cutting all kinds of food, which could be what the sentence is referring to. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Getting in shape typically involves regular exercise and healthier lifestyle choices, both of which can lead to increased energy levels, improved mood, and stronger muscles. Feeling better and feeling stronger are commonly reported benefits of regular exercise and physical activity. Feeling depressed and experiencing pain are much less likely outcomes of getting in shape. Looking better may also be a factor, but it is not necessarily the primary goal or outcome of improving one's physical fitness.
The sentence suggests that Teddy enjoyed learning languages, which implies that he saw some benefit to doing so. Many people learn new languages in order to better communicate with others from different countries or cultures, as it can be very helpful for travel, work, and personal relationships. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "right-hand man" is commonly used to describe someone's closest and most trusted assistant or partner. The term "number 1" is often used in a similar context to refer to someone who is considered the primary or most important individual. The other choices do not relate to the concept of a trusted assistant or partner in any way.
The phrase "wonderful place" suggests that the answer should be a location that is desirable or high-quality. The options "comfortable chair," "floor," and "window sill" are not locations where a person would typically go to get a cat. While Walmart does sell pet supplies, it is not typically considered a place to acquire an animal. The Humane Society, on the other hand, is a reputable organization that is dedicated to finding loving homes for animals in need, making it a logical choice for someone looking to adopt a cat.
Smoking is widely known to have detrimental effects on one's health, particularly on the respiratory system. One of the most common and severe consequences of smoking is lung disease, which can manifest in various forms such as COPD and lung cancer. The other options are not necessarily negative consequences of smoking, but rather potential perceived benefits or neutral outcomes.
The sentence suggests that the non slip mat was designed to be used in a place where there is water, as it is meant to collect it. Bathrooms are typically the only room in a household with water sources, such as sinks or showers, making it the most likely place to use a non slip mat that is designed to collect water. The other options do not mention any connection to water or potential uses for a non slip mat.
The word "building" suggests a structure that contains multiple rooms or spaces, which typically have doors. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of doors. A wall, for example, may or may not have any doors built into it. A hardware store may sell doors, but it is not a location where multiple doors are found in one place. An apartment or office may have multiple doors, but neither term specifically implies the presence of more than one door.
The sentence suggests that the person was inspired to explore more after seeing old things, which indicates a sense of curiosity. The other options, such as painful memories or new memories, do not align with the context of the sentence. "Reverence" and "remind" may have some connection to old things, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that they are the correct answer choices.
The sentence implies that the ficus tree is not originally from the state known for actors and surfers (presumably California) but can be found somewhere else. The option "conservatory" makes the most sense since it is a place where trees from different regions or climates are kept and maintained. The other options are either too obvious (front yard or farm) or too broad (tropical forest), making them less logical choices.
The sentence suggests that when love is not reciprocated, negative emotions are involved. Pain and suffering are common reactions to unrequited love, as it can cause feelings of rejection, heartbreak, and loss. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not directly relate to unrequited love and its emotional impact.
The sentence suggests that people are most comfortable somewhere, and one of the options is "own home". It is a common belief that people feel most comfortable and at ease in their own homes where they have control over their environment and can relax without feeling the need to be on guard or cautious. The other options do not have as clear a connection to the context of the sentence, and spending time or talking to other people can vary in comfort levels depending on the situation.
The sentence suggests that the individual is sharing the tasks they have completed with many people, which implies a sense of achievement or accomplishment. Bragging implies an excessive sense of pride or boastfulness, which may not be the case. Annoyance, religion, and learn about do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy owned a physical store in the Midwest that sold high-quality clothing. The options "strip mall" and "shopping mall" both suggest a more commercial or lower-end location, which may not be appropriate for a store that sells high-end clothing. "Heaven" is illogical and clearly not meant as a serious answer. Therefore, the most reasonable option is "city or town," which suggests a more upscale, boutique-style store location. Ohio may or may not be the correct answer, as the sentence does not provide enough information to determine Billy's specific location.
The sentence suggests that the fish remained in the water that was transferred, which implies that they were not released into a natural body of water like a reflecting pool or the surface of the earth. The sewage treatment plant is also an unlikely choice as it is not a typical destination for live aquatic life. Therefore, the most logical place for the fish to end up would be in a fish tank where they could continue to live in a controlled environment.
The sentence suggests that the pennies will be used soon, which implies that they are needed for everyday expenses. Therefore, the most convenient place to put them would be in a pocket, where they can easily be accessed when needed. The other options (jar, water fountain, drawer, trunk) are not practical or logical places to store pennies for daily use.
The context suggests that the cats are experiencing sunlight, which may make them feel relaxed and comfortable. The action that most cats would likely take in this scenario is to lie down and bask in the warmth of the sunlight. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Petty crimes are small offenses that typically carry a relatively light punishment, such as a fine or brief incarceration. Jails are typically used for shorter-term confinement of individuals who have been charged with or convicted of a crime, while prisons are typically used for longer-term confinement of more serious offenders. The other options are unlikely to be places where someone convicted of a crime would spend time, with options such as selling or offering drugs being illegal activities themselves. Nightclubs are entertainment venues and are not typically associated with punishment or correctional facilities.
The sentence suggests that the person achieved their goals through hard work, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. A headache and disappointment would imply negative emotions, while celebrated and simplicity do not necessarily relate to the concept of achieving goals through hard work.
The genre of documentary filmmaking is often associated with presenting a factual and informative perspective on a given subject. Viewers of documentaries are typically seeking to gain a deeper understanding or insight into a topic that interests them. While documentaries may evoke emotions such as fear or provide entertainment value, these factors are typically not the primary reason why someone seeks out a documentary. Similarly, while documentaries may increase awareness of certain issues, this is often a secondary goal to the primary objective of cultivating greater understanding and insight.
Geese are known to migrate in flocks through the air, so if they are invading a secure installation, it is likely that they will be spotted first in the air as they fly in. The option "group together" could be a possible answer as well, but it is not as specific as "fly." The other options, such as "guard house" and "ground," are not directly related to geese invasion and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
A credit card is typically kept in a wallet, which is a small flat case that is used for carrying cash, cards, and other small personal items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question, as they are either locations (envelope) or unrelated words (resturant, wakket). The word "purse" may be confusing, as it is also used to refer to a larger bag that women carry, but in this context, it does not make sense as a place to keep a credit card.
The sentence suggests that Robinson was stranded and needed some form of shelter, and that he relied on something or someone to provide it. The phrase "huge tree" implies that the tree was large enough to provide some form of shelter. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not offer a plausible solution for Robinson's need for shelter.
The sentence suggests that Lance had a temper, but was actively trying to improve by removing himself from a situation to calm down. The phrase "cooling off" implies that Lance's body temperature was elevated due to his anger, so he did not need a "loss of heat." The other options (expansion, relaxation, soap, and revenge) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that despite the person's outward appearance of laziness, they possessed a strong imagination. A productive imagination would make sense here, as it implies that the person is actively creating and generating ideas, despite their perceived laziness. The other options either do not match the context of the sentence or do not offer a viable alternative to a productive imagination.
The word "cafe" refers to a place where people can have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question - movies are a form of entertainment, Idaho is a state, universities are educational institutions, and the universe is everything that exists.
The sentence suggests that the person is reluctant to eat vegetables, and specifically mentions baked potatoes. In this context, "prepare" makes the most sense as an answer, as it implies that the person doesn't know how to cook or season vegetables properly. "Clean" and "wash" are unlikely answers, as potatoes are typically cleaned and washed before baking. "Grow" is also unlikely, as the person's reluctance to eat vegetables suggests that they are not interested in gardening. "Open mouth" is a non-sequitur and is clearly not a viable answer.
A courthouse is typically a government building where legal proceedings take place, such as trials or hearings. The purpose of a courthouse is to administer justice and enforce the law. As such, the city where a courthouse is located is often considered the seat of government for the county in which it resides. Therefore, the correct answer is county. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Plants, like all living things, are composed of cells. It is through these cells that they perform their various functions such as photosynthesis, respiration, and growth. The other options describe different parts of a plant and their functions, but do not directly answer the question of what plants are made of.
Bugs are typically found in natural environments such as fields, meadows, and gardens, as well as in areas with organic matter such as garbage cans. Roofs are not typically a habitat for bugs, as they are typically dry and do not provide access to food or shelter for most insects.
The sentence suggests that the bird is flying upwards, which typically means it is soaring through the air. The most logical option for where the bird would be flying in this context is the sky. The other options, such as mountain or forest, do not make sense in relation to flight. Similarly, nest and roof are both objects that the bird may land on, but they are not locations for flight.
The sentence suggests that skiing without warm clothes can lead to a specific consequence, and "getting cold" is the most logical choice as it directly relates to the situation. "Fall down" and "accident" are not related to the lack of warm clothes, while "hunger" is also unlikely in this context. "Get cold" and "getting cold" are both grammatically correct, but "getting cold" may be a more appropriate choice as it matches the present continuous tense of "you're skiing."
The question is asking where someone might keep personal soap, suggesting that the answer will be a location where an individual has control over their belongings. The options "birthday party" and "supermarket" are unlikely places to keep personal soap as they are public spaces. "Jail" is a possible place where someone might keep personal soap, but it is unlikely as personal belongings are limited in such an environment. Therefore, the most logical answer is "own home" or a "cabinet" within the home, as this is a place where people commonly store their personal items.
The words "clerks" and "businesses" suggest a commercial setting, which is often found in an office block. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The options do not relate to the given context of a person wanting a seafood dinner. It is important to carefully read and understand the context before choosing an answer. In this case, we can infer that the person likely went to a seafood restaurant or prepared a seafood meal at home based on their desire for a seafood dinner.
The sentence suggests that the teenager is playing a trumpet, which is a common instrument used in marching bands and concert bands. These types of bands are often associated with high schools and colleges, making high school band the most likely choice. Orchestra and music shop/music store do not fit the context of a teenager playing a trumpet, and rock groups typically do not use trumpets as a primary instrument.
The sentence implies that the lantern is not available for purchase, meaning it is likely owned by someone. The most likely place for someone to have a lantern is in their house, as it can be used for power outages or outdoor activities like camping. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence - an antique shop might have a lantern for sale, a trashcan is not a suitable place for a lantern, and a dark place doesn't provide any clue as to where the lantern might be.
The question is asking for a reason that would cause someone to stop driving a car. While there are various reasons why someone might stop driving, a car crash is the most clear and abrupt reason. The other options are not necessarily reasons to stop driving, as someone could continue driving while feeling bored, sleepy, or moving to a new location.
The sentence suggests that the person has a skill in playing the bass, which likely refers to the bass guitar as that is a common instrument that is "strung". The other choices, such as music shop, marching band, write music, and orchestra, do not seem related to the idea of "stringing" an instrument.
Chlorinated dihydrogen monoxide refers to water that has been treated with chlorine, which is a common practice in swimming pools to keep them clean and safe for use. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker wants an honest real estate agent, and the phrase "last thing you want" implies a negative outcome. "Misrepresent" means to give a false or misleading impression of something, which would be the opposite of what the speaker is looking for. The other choices all involve some level of deception or dishonesty, which is not desirable when working with a real estate agent.
The sentence mentions that the vacation price includes hotel and meals, which implies that the location chosen is likely a resort or package deal that includes these amenities. Las Vegas and other metropolitan areas may offer hotels and meals separately, but they are not typically associated with resort-style vacation packages. The other choices also do not have a strong connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "assistance" implies that someone is receiving help or support in a time of need or difficulty. Therefore, the most likely benefit of receiving assistance would be relief from whatever challenge or problem the person was facing. The other options, while potentially positive outcomes of receiving assistance, do not capture the immediate and primary benefit that someone would feel in the moment of receiving help.
The sentence suggests that the revolving door in question had an emergency security lock because of the presence of large amounts of money. This is a common feature in banks, where significant sums of money are typically stored and exchanged. The other options may also have revolving doors, but they don't necessarily relate to the context of the sentence, or to the need for an emergency lock.
The sentence implies that a person who needs to rest often may not have enough energy or strength to carry out their activities without feeling tired. This may indicate weakness or fatigue. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "fresh" suggests that the green beans are recently harvested and have not been stored for long periods of time. Typically, green beans are not grown in a person's mouth or on a plate. They are often grown in fields, but the mention of freshness implies that they have not yet been picked. Containers may be used for storage or transportation, but they do not necessarily guarantee freshness. Farmer's markets are known for selling locally grown produce that is fresh and in season, making it a likely option for finding the freshest green beans.
Nevada is a landlocked state in the western United States, meaning it does not have direct access to any ocean. However, the Pacific Ocean is located to the west of the state. Therefore, "west" is the correct answer. The other options do not provide a direction to the Pacific Ocean.
The sentence suggests that John's bosses think he needs to speed up or become faster in order to improve his performance. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "reliable" suggests that John is not trustworthy, "hasty" and "rapid" suggest that he is moving too quickly, and "prompt" suggests that he is not punctual.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is okay while eating the hamburger, indicating that she is not experiencing any negative physical symptoms such as choking or nausea. Additionally, the phrase "she seemed to be okay" implies that Sarah is feeling good or satisfied with the hamburger, which supports the correct answer being "enjoying". The other options are unlikely given the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John enjoys learning about people's feelings, indicating that he has a strong interest in gaining insight into human behavior. Additionally, the phrase "gave him something" implies that John is deriving some sort of benefit from these interactions. "Increased understanding" aligns with both of these ideas, as it suggests that talking to people about their feelings could give John a deeper understanding of human emotions and behavior. The other options do not align with the positive tone of the sentence and are therefore unlikely answers.
The sentence suggests that the brothers were punching with anger, which implies that they were intentionally trying to cause harm to someone or something. The other answer options (to defend themselves, broken bones, bruise, pain for) do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not explain why the brothers were punching angrily.
The question specifies that it is asking about the size of a school cafeteria, which implies that the correct answer must be related to a school. The option "high school" is specific to a certain type of school, which suggests that it may be the correct answer. The other options do not provide any information about the type or size of the cafeteria.
Cabbage and broccoli are cruciferous vegetables that are known to cause gas in some people due to their high fiber content. The sentence suggests that the person was experiencing discomfort as a result of their diet, which is consistent with the symptoms of gas. The other options may be potential consequences of overeating, but they are not specifically related to the consumption of cabbage and broccoli as mentioned in the sentence.
A balcony is typically found in a theatre, where it is an elevated platform that offers a better view of the stage. In a hotel, a balcony is usually attached to a room and overlooks a courtyard or surrounding landscape, but it would not be used to watch a show. A movie house typically has stadium-style seating instead of a balcony. New Orleans and courtyard are not relevant to the question.
Heatstroke is a serious medical condition that requires immediate action to prevent further damage to the body. The most effective way to treat heatstroke is to cool off the body as quickly as possible. This can involve moving to a cooler environment, removing excess clothing, and applying cool water to the skin. The other options, such as building a snowman or eating ice cream, may provide temporary relief but will not effectively treat the underlying condition. Swimming may also be dangerous if the person is experiencing heatstroke and unable to properly regulate their body temperature.
The sentence indicated that John picked up the pencil and put it back where it was, which suggests that the pencil had a designated place to be stored. Out of the choices given, the only option that implies a storage location is "shelf." The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a high number of apartments available, indicating that it is likely a densely populated area such as a town or city. The other options (Michigan and Texas) are specific states and do not give any indication of the location being referred to. "Budget" is not a place, and "avoid buying" is not a location at all.
The fact that Jane started sneezing after using a cleaning agent suggests that she may be experiencing an allergic reaction to the product. Sneezing is a common symptom of allergies, especially when it comes to airborne particles like dust or fumes from cleaning agents. Pain and suffering, fever, and boredom do not fit the context of the sentence and cleanliness, while related to housework, does not relate to the symptoms Jane is experiencing.
The sentence suggests that the telephone is used to connect people, which is a common knowledge fact. The other choices are antonyms of the word "connect" and do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the weasel is in a confined space, likely due to the curse of the witch. A chicken coop is a small enclosed area where chickens are kept, making it a plausible location for the weasel to be stuck in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking for a characteristic that distinguishes a person from a stuffed dummy, implying that the dummy cannot experience pain, while a person can. Pain is a sensory experience that is unique to living beings, and therefore it is the only option that separates a person from a stuffed dummy. The other options either do not relate to the ability to experience pain or are not exclusive to living beings.
The term "business leader" suggests that the person is in a position of authority within a company or organization. Therefore, they would be responsible for managing the organization and its employees, making decisions about budgets and strategy, and setting goals and objectives. The other options, such as army, country, micromanagement, and pack, do not have any connection to the context of a business leader.
When shopping for clothes at a store, customers typically use a dressing room to try on the clothes and check themselves out in a mirror. A dressing room provides privacy for customers to change in and out of clothing and allows them to see how the clothes fit and look on their body. The other options, such as a bedroom, hotel, fun house, or house, may have mirrors but they are not typically used for trying on clothes in a retail setting.
The sentence mentions "prison movies," which implies that the correct answer is a well-known prison that has been featured in popular culture. Alcatraz is a well-known prison located in San Francisco Bay that has been the setting for several well-known movies and TV shows, including "Escape From Alcatraz" and "The Rock." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Wood comes from trees, so it is logical to assume that the best place to get fresh wood is from a tree. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A boat is made of wood, but it is unlikely that one would go to a boat to get fresh wood. A hardware store may sell wood, but it may not be fresh. One's own home may have some wood, but it is unlikely to be fresh, and the question is asking for a place to get fresh wood. The jungle may have trees, but it is not a practical answer for most people.
The sentence suggests that the person was eating a roast beef sandwich and spilled a spicy sauce on it. Horseradish is a common condiment used with roast beef, and is known for its spicy flavor. The other options, such as Texas or a guest room, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "Everything is bigger" is often associated with Texas and its culture. Additionally, the mention of a "steak house" also supports the idea that Texas is the correct answer, as the state has a reputation for its love of steak and BBQ. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that Bill would not allow Sam to build a new addition, which means that Sam was not permitted to do so. Sam's protest would suggest that he believed he had the right to build the addition, but Bill had explicitly forbidden him from doing so. Forbidden is the correct choice as it accurately reflects the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest that the construction was either already in place or that Bill was being too strict in his management of the property.
The sentence implies that there are two different groups of people who have different energy levels at different times of day. The phrase "after lunch" suggests that the second group of people doesn't really get going until the afternoon. The other options are either too early (morning) or too late (nighttime and dusk) to fit the context.
The phrase "letting oneself go" often refers to a person neglecting their physical appearance, hygiene, or other aspects of their life due to being in a comfortable and committed relationship. This can include things like gaining weight or not prioritizing self-care as much. The other options do not make sense in the context of being in a relationship.
The fact that Bobby noticed that the silverware was plastic suggests that he was dining out at a restaurant. If he were at home, he likely would have known beforehand whether the silverware was plastic or not. The other options, such as silver and cupboard, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that James is an animal that is being kept in captivity. The fact that he is surrounded by children and separated from the outside world by glass suggests that he is being kept in a controlled environment, like a terrarium. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - a weasel would not typically be found in a law firm or a classroom, and a forest is not a controlled environment. A zoo might be a possibility but terrarium is a more specific and likely option given the details provided.
The sentence suggests that giving assistance to family members in need can elicit an emotional response, and it is up to the reader to determine what that response might be. Since the other options are generally negative (death, sadness) or more neutral (pleasure, reward), satisfaction stands out as the most likely answer. Helping others, especially family members, can be a rewarding experience that often leads to feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment.
The sentence suggests that people were drinking outside and littering, specifically throwing bottles on the ground. A field would be a logical place for this to occur, as it is an open space that people may go to for recreational activities. The other options may also be places where littering occurs, but the mention of broken glass suggests a larger and potentially more dangerous amount of litter than would be found in a typical trash can or recycling bin.
The sentence suggests that the accumulation of mercury in certain fish can have negative effects. The word "toxic" specifically refers to the poisonous nature of mercury and its ability to cause harm to living organisms. The other options do not accurately describe the effects of mercury buildup in fish. "Uninhabitable" and "barren and airless" describe physical environments, not the effects of a substance on living organisms. "Poisonous" is a synonym for toxic and is also a correct answer. "Obesity" is not related to the topic of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sam is receiving something that he does not want, and headaches are often seen as a negative experience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as satisfaction, being happy, and money are generally viewed as positive things, while "then have" is nonsensical in this context.
A mouse trap is designed to trap and kill mice, which are attracted to cheese. Therefore, cheese would be dangerous for mice in a mouse trap. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question suggests that playing violin may result in a negative outcome, which can be inferred from the fact that someone is trying to stop it from happening. One reason for this could be that the violin is producing loud noises that may disturb other people nearby. Of the options given, only "loud noises" is directly related to this context, while the others do not provide a clear explanation for why someone would want to stop someone else from playing the violin.
The term "human weasel" is not a common descriptor for any specific group of people. However, the fact that it is mentioned in relation to a children's song suggests that it may be a character or concept from that context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the group mentioned was responsible for explaining why the defendant was guilty of obstructing justice. This is consistent with the role of the prosecution in a criminal trial, which is to present evidence and arguments in support of a guilty verdict. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A washcloth is a commonly kept item in a linen closet, along with towels and other linens for personal hygiene and household use. Bathing and using the bathroom sink may involve using a washcloth, but do not necessarily guarantee that one will be available if you do not have one. The garage and Walmart are not typically places where one would store or obtain a washcloth.
The sentence suggests that the host of the party was stationed at the front door, which is typically where guests are welcomed into a home or venue. The other options do not make sense in this context: talking on a radio show, shutting the door, expecting company, and sitting at the head table are all unrelated to welcoming guests at a party.
The sentence suggests that the person was lost and needed a map, which implies that they were traveling by car or some form of transportation. Gas stations are often convenient places to stop for maps and directions, as well as fuel and snacks. The other options (backpack, amusement park, taco shop) do not have any clear connection to the situation described in the sentence. A truck stop might be a plausible option, but it is less likely to have maps and directions available to non-commercial drivers.
The sentence implies that light is necessary or important when trying to read. Reading typically requires visual clarity, which is provided by sufficient lighting. Therefore, a lack of light, or inadequate lighting conditions, could impede or hinder reading ability. The other options, such as "heavy" or "cumbersome," do not make sense in the context of reading and therefore can be eliminated.
The sentence indicates that driving drunk is not only stupid but also has serious consequences. The word "even" implies that the consequence can be worse than just causing damage or being dangerous. The word "deadly" means causing or capable of causing death, which fits the severity of the situation described in the sentence. The other options are not appropriate because they do not reflect the seriousness of the situation.
The sentence suggests that the bread was being baked, as the sourdough starter was rising inside "where." This "where" is likely the oven, as that is where bread is typically baked. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - the bread pan is where the dough is typically formed, yeast is an ingredient used to make bread rise, flour is an ingredient used to make dough, and "to the top" does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the new worker was obstructing the work area and potentially endangering themselves with the dangerous equipment. The phrase "standing in the way" implies that the foreman wants the worker to move out of the path of the equipment. The phrase "move away from" indicates the same meaning as "step out of" but is a more common phrase to use in this context. The other options do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time is an exciting or anticipated event. The options "cheer" and "talk" do not accurately capture the emotion being described, while "joy" may be an appropriate response but doesn't quite capture the sense of anticipation or excitement.
The sentence implies that the company is able to keep manufacturing costs low, which suggests that they have control over the production process. Using slave labor would likely result in legal and ethical issues, and liquidating the company would not reduce manufacturing costs. Paying employees and mailing clients are not relevant to the manufacturing process. Therefore, the answer is likely that the company has its own factory, which allows it to control production and keep costs low.
The word "confirm" means to verify or corroborate information that is already known or believed to be true. In order to confirm information, you would need to ask for clarification or verification from someone who has knowledge of the subject. The other options do not make sense in the context of confirming information.
The word "bounds" implies that something is enclosing or holding together the book. Out of the choices given, only "cover" can fulfill that description. Staples could be used to hold together the pages, but it does not enclose the entire book. "At least a few pages" and "many words" describe the contents of the book, but do not refer to what physically binds it together.
The sentence implies that listening to a boring talk for a long time can lead to a feeling of exhaustion or weariness, which is commonly associated with fatigue. The other options are not typically associated with the experience of listening to a boring talk.
When an airplane stalls, it means that there isn't enough air flowing over the wings to produce lift, and so the plane begins to lose altitude. Stalling can sometimes lead to a crash, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the plane will crash - the pilot can take corrective action to recover from the stall and regain altitude. The other options imply either a less severe issue (like slowing down or halting) or a more severe one (like crashing or coming to a sudden stop).
The phrase "melting pot" is often used to describe the cultural diversity of America, where people of different ethnicities and backgrounds come together and blend into a unified whole. The word "different" is the only choice that accurately describes the diverse nature of America's population. The other options are either too subjective or have no connection to the concept of cultural diversity.
The sentence implies that there is a difference between running in the Olympics and running outside. This difference can be inferred from the fact that the question asks what is needed for the former that is not needed for the latter. The options "legs," "agility," "movement" and "speed" are all essential for both types of running, so they are not the correct answer. However, the option "more energy than walking" is specific to running in the Olympics, as it requires a higher level of endurance and stamina than everyday running.
Veins are blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart, while arteries carry blood away from the heart. The question specifically asks for something that carries blood toward the heart, which eliminates the options of pumps (which are devices that may aid in circulation but do not carry blood themselves), hospitals and soccer games (which are not related to the circulatory system), and people (who may have veins but are not themselves a means of transporting blood).
The sentence suggests that the kids were eating crackers while playing on the floor, which likely resulted in crumbs being scattered across the surface. The mother then had to vacuum up these crumbs in order to clean the floor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wants more light sources while they are awake at night, which implies that they are likely indoors. The most logical option for adding more light indoors would be to install a lamp. The other options do not make sense in the context of wanting more light while being indoors at night (sky) or are impractical (digging in the garden) or not as bright or safe (candle).
The sentence implies that beans are being turned into a beverage. One common beverage made from beans is coffee, which is made by brewing coffee beans. The other options either do not involve beans or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The word "usually" suggests that the answer is a common occurrence. While there may be more than one telephone in the other options listed, it is most common to have multiple phones in a friend's house. Additionally, desktops and phone booths typically only have one phone, hospitals usually have phones in patient rooms but not in common areas, and parties may have only one phone or none at all.
The question is asking about the outcome of someone wading while fishing, which suggests that the person will be standing in water while trying to catch fish. Therefore, it is likely that they will get wet as a result of the activity. The other options do not make sense in this context - happiness and anger are emotions that may be associated with fishing, but not specifically with wading while fishing. Getting drunk may be a possible outcome of drinking while fishing, but not necessarily related to wading in particular. Catching fish is the goal of fishing, but this option does not provide information on what happens to the person wading.
The sentence suggests that the location where residents socialized, played dice, and smoked is a public and busy area. An airport, ocean, and casino do not fit this description as they are typically regulated or have restricted access. An apartment building, while it may have public areas, is unlikely to have such a busy landing. A stairwell, on the other hand, is a common location for socialization in some communities and can be a high traffic area within a building.
Taking drugs can sometimes numb or dull physical or emotional pain, making it a possible reason why a person would take drugs. This is because drugs can alter the brain's chemistry, leading to a temporary relief of physical or emotional discomfort. The other options do not have a clear connection to the act of taking drugs.
The word "screen" implies a visual presentation, which is commonly associated with movies. While some of the other options such as theatre, show, and comedy may also be presented on a screen, they are not as commonly associated with the word "entertainment." A casino, on the other hand, typically does not involve a screen but rather physical games and activities.
The sentence relates to the act of ordering a cup of coffee, which is commonly associated with coffee shops. While coffee can be consumed in many different places, it is most commonly ordered and prepared in a café or coffee shop. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cows were being judged in a competitive setting, which typically takes place at agricultural fairs or exhibitions. Fairgrounds are commonly used for showcasing livestock competitions, including cows. The other options are possible locations for cows, but do not provide any indication that they are being judged or evaluated.
The question is asking about what to do with a spoon after finishing eating. Since the other choices are all related to eating or serving food, it can be inferred that the spoon is also related to eating. The most likely place to put a spoon after eating is in a dishwasher, where it can be cleaned along with other dishes and utensils. The other options, such as a bowl of soup or serving dish, would require the spoon to be used again, whereas the washing machine and dinner are not related to eating or cleaning dishes.
The sentence suggests that performing physical tasks can lead to a certain outcome, and the other options do not fit that context. Injury is a possibility but is not as general as the overall meaning of the sentence. Doing your best and getting accolades are not necessarily tied to physical tasks, and "friend" seems out of place in this sentence. Therefore, tiredness is the most appropriate answer, as it is a common result of performing physical tasks.
Foxes are known to create underground dens or burrows in order to hide from predators or harsh weather conditions. This behavior is commonly associated with foxes, making the option "burrow" the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that eating and not exercising can lead to negative consequences, specifically mentioning problems. Gaining weight is a well-known issue that can result from a lack of exercise and overeating. The other options either do not relate to the negative consequences of eating and not exercising or are synonymous with the act of eating.
The use of black and white photography is less common in modern times, and is often associated with the past. Additionally, the use of "look" in the sentence suggests that the photograph is being viewed in the present, which would indicate that it is not a recent image. The other options, while also implying a sense of time, do not necessarily suggest an association with black and white photography or a non-recent image.
The sentence suggests that the stories about a talking beaver can be enjoyed by children, which implies that they are likely written in a format that is accessible to children. Books are a common medium for children's stories, and the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that the talking beaver lives in a wooded area or body of water is not relevant to the medium in which the stories are presented.
The sentence suggests that the person is planning to stop being married, which implies a sense of emotional distance or detachment from their spouse. The other options (bankruptcy, sad, fights, wrong) do not necessarily capture this sense of emotional detachment and, while they could be relevant in certain contexts, do not seem to fit the specific context of the sentence.
Old pictures are usually considered valuable and are often preserved in places like museums. Trunks, suitcases, and attics are all places where people might keep personal belongings, but they are not commonly associated with the preservation of historical artifacts like old pictures. It is also unlikely that someone would keep old pictures in a fridge.
The sentence mentions ice, which suggests that the correct answer must be related to a place where ice is present. Antarctica is known for its icy terrain, making it a likely option. Mixed drinks, the refrigerator, water coolers, and hockey games do not have any clear connection to the concept of ice in the context of the sentence.
The sentence clearly states that John found old stuff while cleaning out the house, and specifically mentions that there was nothing upstairs, suggesting that the old stuff was found in a place other than the upstairs area. The options "loft," "cellar," and "waste bin" are unlikely to contain old items, and "museum" doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely "attic," a common storage space in many homes where people often keep old items.
Dollar bills are typically carried in pockets, as they are small enough to fit comfortably in a pants or jacket pocket. Wallets and purses are also common places to carry money, but the question specifies "a man," which suggests a preference for carrying money in a more practical and accessible manner. A bank or car would not be appropriate choices for carrying just one dollar bill.
The question is asking about a specific use case for a blanket, which is to cover a horse. Horses are typically found in outdoor settings, such as farms, ranches, or in transportation. Therefore, the option that best fits the intended use case is backpack, as a blanket may be useful for covering a horse during transport in a backpack-style carrier. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that exercise is important for a person's health, but it is not the only factor. The phrase "and what?" implies that there is another important factor to consider. Eating well is commonly associated with good health, as a balanced and nutritious diet can help maintain physical and mental well-being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some (such as drinking lots of soda) may actually be harmful to one's health.
The sentence suggests that garbage waste is being poured out onto the road, which means it will likely wash away with rain or other forms of water runoff. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve the disposal of garbage waste on a road.
The sentence is asking for a place that is a middle ground between a country, which is a large geographical area, and a city, which is a smaller, more densely populated area. A town is a type of urban area that is smaller than a city but larger than a village or rural area. France and continent are too large to be the answer, state refers to a subdivision of a country and is too broad of an answer, and metal is not related to geography or place size.
The sentence suggests that the professor spoke in a reserved, conservative, and laconic tone, meaning that he probably used short, simple, and precise language. The answer choices are all related to the opposite of this, meaning that the professor was likely avoiding bombastic, loquacious, verbose, talkative, and prolix language (which all mean using excessive or unnecessary words or being overly talkative).
The sentence suggests that Joe stabbed a man, but did not intend to do so. Consequently, he is scared of the potential consequences, indicating that he understands the severity of his actions. The collapsed state of the man indicates that he was severely injured, likely with knife wounds. This would cause the man to bleed, making bleeding the correct choice. The other options, such as knives or law suit, do not fit the context of the sentence.
A frying pan is a cooking utensil and is typically stored in the kitchen. The context of the question implies that the answer should be a location in the kitchen where a frying pan can be kept. The other options are not related to the context of the question, as a galley is a type of ship kitchen, department store is a place where items are sold, closet is not typically found in kitchens, and homes is too broad and does not specify a location.
The sentence implies that the child and her brother had different preferences in terms of the movie's characters. The word "lady" suggests a female character, while the option "guy" refers to a male character, which makes it the most likely answer. The other options are less likely as they do not have a clear gender association, or do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
This question is asking for a factually correct answer about the physical consequences of touching a hot stove. When a person touches a hot stove, they can sustain burns from the heat. This knowledge is based on scientific principles of thermodynamics and the properties of heat. The other options are irrelevant or inaccurate in this context.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to a mode of transportation when one does not have a car. The options "go home" and "get drunk" are not related to transportation, so they can be eliminated. The options "commute" and "avoid parking hassle" suggest a regular, planned trip, while the option "get somewhere" is more general and could refer to any destination. Therefore, "get somewhere" is the correct answer.
Medical instruments are primarily used in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and clinics. The operating room is a specific area within a healthcare facility where surgical procedures are performed, making it the most likely option in the given choices. The other options have no apparent connection to the context of medical instruments.
The sentence mentions a "scoreboard" and suggests that the place is used for playing an "indoor sport." A scoreboard is typically found in a stadium where sports events are held. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shelf is meant for storing perishable items that require cold temperatures, which implies that it must be located inside a refrigerator. Cupboards and bookstores are not generally associated with keeping things cold, while corners and Antarctica are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "árbol de manzana" is Spanish for "apple tree," therefore it can be assumed that the correct answer is Spain, where the Spanish language is spoken. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fish needs to be cooked in order to make a meal. "Hungry" and "wife asked to" do not provide any information on what type of food could be made with fish. "Sushi" is a specific dish that involves raw fish, and "lamb sauce" is not related to fish at all. Therefore, "have cooked" is the most appropriate answer that fits the context of the sentence.
Snakes are not great swimmers and are not likely to go into water if there are other options available. In general, snakes prefer dry areas with ample cover and a good supply of prey. Tropical forests, creeks, and underbrush are all typical habitats for snakes, while "outdoors" is not specific enough to provide any meaningful information.
The question suggests that when people successfully learn a lesson, something specific happens as a result. The choices provided are all possible actions or outcomes, but only one directly relates to the act of learning a lesson - gaining knowledge. When people learn a lesson, it means they have acquired new information or understanding, which can be described as gaining knowledge. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the question.
The context suggests that the item being sold is related to writing or office supplies. The grocery store and martyr's chest are unlikely places to find writing instruments, while dek is an unfamiliar term that does not provide any context clues. The office supply store is a possibility, but the mention of letter openers as well as writing instruments strongly suggests that a stationery store is the most likely place to find both items.
The sentence suggests that the companies were already working well together, indicating a positive relationship between them. When companies have a good relationship, they may decide to extend their working contract or agreement to continue their partnership. Shorten, compress, and retract all suggest a reduction or termination of the working agreement, while "fur" does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that Debbie wants a dress that is not plain or ordinary. The words "unusual and attention-getting" indicate that she wants something unique and possibly from a different cultural tradition. The word "exotic" means foreign or unusual, which fits with the description of the dress Debbie wants. The other options either do not fit with the character's desire for something special or have a negative connotation.
Reading a book about a topic that you have little knowledge in can help you learn new information and increase your understanding of the topic. The other options are not necessarily guaranteed outcomes of reading a book on an unfamiliar topic.
The friend's suggestion was to do something that would help the woman relax while her child was in a competition. Listening to music is a well-known way to decrease stress and anxiety, and can be particularly effective in situations where someone is feeling nervous or worried. The other options don't offer any clear solution to the woman's problem.
Coffee tables are typically found in living rooms, where they serve as a central place for people to place drinks, snacks, and other items. While coffee tables could technically be found in any of the other rooms listed, there is no specific indication that they would be present in those contexts. Internet cafes, for example, might have tables for customers to use their laptops or devices, but these would not necessarily be referred to as "coffee tables." The other options similarly lack any clear connection to the presence of coffee tables.
The sentence suggests that the fur of a puppy has been cleaned through a bath, and it is asking how the fur feels after being cleaned. Generally, after bath fur feels soft, clean, and free from any dirt or dust. Shiny fur can also be possible, but it is not a guaranteed outcome of a bath. "One choice for pet," "cute," and "kennel" do not provide any relevant information about the state of the puppy's fur after taking a bath.
The sentence suggests that a wine cellar requires a consistently cool (temperature-controlled) and dark environment, which is commonly found in a basement. A basement is often the preferred location for a wine cellar as it provides the necessary conditions for storing wine. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the requirements of a wine cellar.
The phrase "hovered by the exit" suggests that the cats are waiting to leave a particular location, likely indoors. The phrase "go outside" is the only option that directly relates to this context and makes sense in the sentence. The other options either do not have a connection to the idea of leaving a location or are not supported by the context provided.
The sentence suggests that the teen in question had poor posture which implies that they did not stand up straight. "Upright" is the only choice that directly relates to standing in a straight posture, while the other options do not have a specific connection to the context of the sentence.
Delicatessens are typically popular in urban areas with diverse populations and a strong culinary culture. City centers and large cities are more likely to have a variety of food options, including specialty delis that cater to different communities and tastes. Malls and shops may have food courts or cafes, but they are less likely to feature a dedicated delicatessen. Michigan is a state and not a specific location, so it does not fit the question.
The sentence suggests that the archaeologist was able to identify that the artifacts were fake, which implies that he knew what he was looking for and was an expert in his field. Since the artifacts were fake, it is likely that the archaeologist would feel angry or frustrated that someone was trying to deceive others. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is nothing in the sentence to suggest that the archaeologist was feeling any of those emotions.
The sentence indicates that the construction manager was communicating with financiers, suggesting that he was updating them on the status of the building project. The word "briefing" suggests a report or update, rather than a discussion of ideas or collaboration. The option "bulldozer" is a machine used in construction, but it is not relevant to the sentence. The options "collaboration" and "exchanging ideas" suggest a more collaborative process, which is not consistent with the context of the sentence. The option "static" is also not relevant to the sentence.
Mailboxes are typically sold at hardware stores or can be obtained from the post office. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "flirty" implies that the person is playful and perhaps teasing, rather than simply being good-looking or enjoying pleasure. While being good-looking may contribute to someone being perceived as flirty, it is not the defining characteristic. Similarly, owning a house or seeking new experiences do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the activity mentioned involves getting junk food and playing games, which is a common feature of carnivals. Carnivals are known for offering a variety of fun activities and indulgent treats like fried foods and sweets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence hints that a plastic item is used to store dairy, which can imply that the item needs to be lightweight, airtight, and made of a material that is safe for food storage. Out of the given choices, only a container satisfies all these requirements. A container can come in different shapes and sizes, making it a versatile option for storing different types of dairy (e.g., milk, yogurt, cheese). The other options (freezer, bucket, refrigerator, fridge) refer to either a location or an appliance rather than a specific plastic item.
Rest areas are typically found along highways or major roads and are specifically designed for drivers to take a break and use the restroom. Schools, hotels, and educational areas are not typically available to the general public for restroom use, and stopping at a friend's house would not be a practical option when traveling long distances.
The sentence suggests that a group of people would undertake a specific action at night, and that the start of the action was signaled by a specific event. "Sundown" is a term used to refer to the time of day when the sun sets below the horizon, which would coincide with the arrival of nighttime. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Based on the context of the sentence, it is clear that the answer must be something that is related to sleeping and breathing. The only option that makes sense in this context is "house" because it is a common location where people sleep and where air can be easily circulated through windows, doors, or ventilation systems. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical answer.
The word "quaint" suggests that the steak house was looking for a charming, old-fashioned location. A town can be a good fit for this description, as many small towns have historic buildings and a slower pace of life. The other options (New York, Mexico, United States) are either too general or not related to the context of the sentence. The option "library" does not make sense as a location for a steak house.
The sentence suggests that Sarah is taking a sip of something she got from pressing a button on a handle. A water fountain would match this description, as it is a common feature in public places where one can press a button to dispense water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy didn't like going fast on a horse because it made him feel a certain way, which is likely a negative emotion. The option that best fits this context is fear, as going fast on a horse can be scary if one doesn't have experience with it. The other options, such as stiffness or blisters, are unlikely to be related to the feeling that Billy is experiencing.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath, specifically in a court of law. The question suggests that someone committing perjury would potentially face jail time. The correct answer, "lies," is directly connected to the act of perjury as it involves giving false information while under oath. The other options, such as "testify," "speaking," "great anxiety," and "guilt," are not specifically related to the act of perjury and do not provide a clear connection to the question.
The sentence suggests that the person does not have any coffee and needs to borrow some. The options include places where one would typically purchase coffee, such as a convenience store or supermarket, or where one might have a meeting or grab a quick bite to eat, such as a fast food restaurant. However, the most appropriate option is a friend's house, as borrowing from a friend is a common practice and aligns with the tone of the sentence.
Fish typically live in bodies of water such as oceans, ponds, bays, and rivers. However, when kept as pets, fish are commonly kept in an enclosed tank called an aquarium. Therefore, the correct answer is aquarium.
Fiddling with something implies manipulating it with one's hands, which requires a high level of dexterity or fine motor skills. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "dexterity". "Practice" and "skill" could be relevant, but not as specific as "dexterity". "Thief" and "knowledge of music" are not related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence refers to a family road trip where the person is sitting in the back seat and looking out of the window. The options that do not make sense include building, ocean, and computer screen, as they suggest a stationary environment instead of a moving one. While a bus could be an option, the sentence specifically mentions "family road trips," which suggests a personal or privately owned vehicle, like a car.
The context of the sentence suggests that there is a negative aspect associated with working in an office. While being paid and making money are common reasons for wanting to work, the sentence implies that there is a specific reason why someone would not want to work in an office. Frustration is a common feeling associated with office work due to factors such as a lack of autonomy, a toxic work environment, or challenging tasks. Blisters and making shareholders richer do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the doctor advised the patient to start jogging in order to achieve a specific goal. One possible reason for this would be to increase the patient's heart rate, which is a common benefit of aerobic exercise like running. Increased heart rate can help to strengthen the heart and improve cardiovascular health. The other options are less likely to be the reason for the doctor's advice, and some may actually have negative consequences for the patient's health (e.g. knee pain).
The question is asking for a solution to the problem of finding time to exercise. The options "exercise", "energy", and "go running" are not solutions to the problem, but rather related concepts. The option "just do" does not provide any actionable advice on how to make time for exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is "make time", as this option directly addresses the question and suggests finding ways to prioritize and schedule exercise into one's daily routine.
A movie is typically categorized as a form of entertainment that involves watching a pre-recorded narrative on a screen. This type of entertainment is commonly referred to as a "movie show," which explains why the correct answer is "show." The other options, such as "performance" and "sporting event," do not accurately describe the experience of watching a movie. A "demonstration" also does not fit the context, as it usually refers to an instructional or educational experience rather than entertainment.
The word "fun" suggests that the activity would be enjoyable and recreational, and "go swimming" is a common leisure activity associated with having fun. The other options, such as "commit crimes" and "part company," have negative connotations and are not appropriate options for an activity related to having fun. "Hungry" is a state of being rather than an activity, and "believe in god" does not relate to a specific action for having fun.
A tourniquet is a device used to stop severe bleeding by applying pressure to the affected limb. It is typically used in emergency situations where the bleeding cannot be controlled by other means. While a doctor's office or hospital may have tourniquets available, they are not typically used in those settings unless there is a specific need. Ambulances may carry tourniquets, but they are not always on hand. Applying even pressure is a general technique that may aid in situations where there is some bleeding but not severe enough to require a tourniquet. Therefore, an emergency kit is the most likely place to find a tourniquet for temporary use.
The context suggests that the question is about storing papers, which implies a need for organization and safekeeping. A drawer is a common storage solution for papers because it offers protection from dust, light, and potential damage. A table is not a storage solution and may not provide adequate protection for papers. A garage is not typically associated with paper storage and may be prone to moisture and temperature changes that can damage paper. Meeting and receipts are not relevant to the question.
The word "food" suggests that the machine is likely to be a type of vending machine. Vending machines are commonly used to distribute snacks and drinks, and are often found in places like hospitals, schools, and office buildings where people may need quick access to food or refreshments. The other options do not relate to the concept of providing food, but instead suggest activities like building, cleaning, or delivering.
The sentence suggests that if your plumbing system is broken, you would need to call a plumber to fix it. The other options do not have any clear connection to plumbing or fixing broken pipes. "Show" is the only option that suggests a possible action or solution to the problem of broken plumbing.
The sentence suggests that something will happen directly after eating, and the most logical option in this case is becoming full. When a person eats, their stomach fills up with food and they may feel full or satisfied. The other options do not accurately describe what happens right after eating or are irrelevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is no one around to hold the lit cigarette, which implies that it needs to be placed somewhere. An ashtray is a common object used to hold cigarettes and dispose of ash and butts. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that the person is looking for a new home for a piece of furniture that holds sentimental value. A pawn shop may not be the best option, as they typically specialize in buying and selling secondhand goods for profit. A rug is not an appropriate answer, as it is not related to furniture. Room and apartment are also not suitable, as they are not specific enough and do not provide any useful information. Therefore, the best choice would be a friend's house, as they may be willing to take the piece of furniture and offer it a new home.
The sentence suggests that Joe is a philosopher who listens to music in order to evoke certain mental states that help him in his work. The word "enlightenment" implies a deep understanding or insight, which is a common goal in many philosophical traditions. The other options don't have the same connotation of a profound or transformative experience.
The word "condo" is short for condominium, which is a type of housing unit that is part of a larger residential building or complex. Therefore, it is likely that a human would be entering a condo in a residential area where such buildings or complexes are located. The other options, such as suburbia, Milwaukee, New York, or a cruise ship, do not necessarily have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the dog enjoys being petted on a specific part of its body, and the options "teeth," "four legs," and "two ears" are unlikely candidates. The option "the gas station ran out of gas today" is completely unrelated to the topic, leaving "paws" as the only logical choice. Additionally, many dogs enjoy having their paws rubbed or scratched, so this choice makes sense given the context of the sentence.
This question refers to the use of a rubber, which is a slang term for a condom. Condoms are commonly kept in a bedside table as they are often used during sexual activities that take place in a bed. The other options, such as drug store or classroom, do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the person became drunk and then laid down on a bench, indicating that they likely lost consciousness or became unconscious. "Pass out" is the most fitting choice because it describes the state of losing consciousness due to alcohol consumption. The other options, such as death and destruction or fall down, are too extreme or don't accurately reflect the situation presented in the sentence.
New York City is often referred to as the cultural capital of the United States, and it has a long history of theater productions. The city's Broadway district is particularly famous for its many theaters that host major productions throughout the year. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and there is no indication that they are known for theaters.
The sentence mentions John's lack of understanding of triangles, which is a key topic in trigonometry. Trigonometry deals with the study of triangles and their relationships to angles and sides. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence suggests that something is dropping from clouds on a warm day, which is likely referring to rain. The phrase "bring rain" also implies a connection to precipitation. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - boiling oil would not come from clouds, and "awe inspiring" and "move in" do not relate to the concept of rain.
The question implies that going to work on an average day is likely to induce a negative emotion. Anger is a common response to perceived stressors such as traffic, difficult coworkers, or the stress of the job itself. The other options do not fit the context of the question as they do not capture the negative emotions that one might experience during a commute or work day.
Being cold typically implies discomfort or a feeling of discomfort associated with a lack of warmth. Therefore, the goal would likely be to alleviate that discomfort by getting warm. The other options are not relevant to the context of feeling cold.
The sentence suggests that the person is pointing their transistor radio upwards, which could indicate that they are trying to pick up transmissions from an object in the sky. The space shuttle regularly transmits data and communication signals to and from Earth, making it a likely target for someone using a transistor radio to listen for transmissions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is an alternative to walking a small dog, and it is something that the dog can ride in. The option "baby carriage" is the most logical choice as it is commonly used to transport small children, and therefore would be a suitable size and shape for a small dog. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question asks about the possible habitat of an American weasel. Since the word "American" is used, the answer is likely to be a location within America. Michigan is a state in the United States that is known to have a variety of habitats suitable for weasels, including forests, fields, and wetlands. The other options, such as chicken coop, hen house or deep sea, are not suitable habitats for weasels. Great Britain is also not a likely option as it is not in America.
The sentence suggests that Sarah had high hopes for her business, implying that it was a venture that could potentially generate a large amount of wealth or income. However, the fact that no one could get money to buy implies that the business involved some sort of product or service that people were interested in but could not afford. Real estate is a common industry where buyers need to secure financing in order to purchase properties, and the market can be volatile, leading to situations where investors can lose money. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the person is sitting at a friend's home and feeling bored, so it would make sense to engage in social interactions with the friend or others present. Watching TV, going somewhere, jumping rope, or cleaning the room do not necessarily involve social interactions or address the feeling of boredom.
The other options do not suggest a legitimate way of earning money. Spending money does the opposite, begging is not a reliable or socially acceptable means of earning money, and gambling at a casino is not a guaranteed way to make money. Passing a course could lead to a higher-paying job, but it is not an immediate way of earning money. Creating art, on the other hand, can result in sales and commissions, making it a viable option for making money.
The travelers expressed a desire to see the countryside, suggesting that they are likely not going to the airport, dock, train station, rest area, or bus depot. These locations are typically associated with transportation rather than sightseeing. The countryside is a popular destination for those seeking natural beauty and a more relaxed pace of life, making it a likely choice for the travelers' destination.
Perjury refers to lying under oath in a legal setting, such as during a trial. If evidence was obtained illegally, it may not be admissible in court, which could result in a mistrial. A mistrial is declared when there is a fundamental error in the legal proceedings that prevents a fair trial from taking place, such as a violation of the defendant's right to due process. Going to jail or acquittal would depend on other factors and may not be directly related to the admissibility of evidence. Tension is not a likely outcome in this scenario.
Writing a term paper requires a significant amount of research in order to ensure that the information included is accurate and credible. Without proper research, it can be difficult to fully understand the topic and provide detailed analysis. The other options listed may be helpful in some way, but they do not directly relate to the task of ensuring accuracy in a term paper.
The question is asking where you could find something related to plumbing that could help you if you are thirsty. Out of the choices given, only a water fountain can provide water that is safe for drinking. The other choices (show, oil refineries, bathroom, and hardware store) are not associated with providing safe drinking water.
The word "intelligent" suggests a person who is knowledgeable and educated, and studying Greek is often associated with academia and intelligence. The other options do not seem to directly relate to intelligence or education.
The sentence suggests that the man's goals were admirable, but his methods were not. The word "ignoble" means not honorable or respectable, so it is a likely answer choice. The other options don't fit the context of the sentence. Peasant, inferior, plebeian, and uneducated are all words that describe a person's social or educational status, which is not relevant to the man's goals and methods.
The context of the sentence suggests that the papers in question are medical papers, which are most commonly found in a hospital setting. The other options are more general and could apply to any setting where paperwork is common, but do not specifically suggest a medical context.
The sentence suggests that the person is seeking revenge for the destruction of their family. The word "killing" implies violence, which is often associated with the desire for revenge. The other options do not make sense in the context of seeking revenge or taking violent actions.
The sentence suggests that the person had been lying to many people, and as a result, had caused problems. The fact that the sentence specifies that the person feels guilty indicates that this is the most likely choice. The other options may be possible consequences of lying, but they do not fit as directly with the context of the sentence as feeling guilty does.
The sentence suggests that Billy is happy about something that the other person did to improve themselves, which is a cause for celebration. The other options do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence.
The word "soggy" implies that the ceiling was wet or damp, most likely due to water seeping through from above. The most logical explanation for this would be a leak in the roof, as a building or field would not be directly above the ceiling in question. "Metaphor" and "sag" are unlikely options, as they do not fit the physical description of the sentence.
The question is asking for a location where one can find an armchair, which is a type of furniture typically used for sitting. A furniture store is a logical answer choice as it specializes in selling various types of furniture. The other options, such as study, living room, grocery store, and hospital, do not have a clear connection to armchairs or the context of the question.
be beef is a type of high-quality beef that comes from a specific breed of cattle that is raised in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan, which includes the city of Kobe. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the source of this steak house's Kobe beef is Japan. The other options do not have any connection to the origin of Kobe beef.
A party is generally viewed as a social event where people come together to enjoy themselves and socialize with others. The phrase "going to a party" suggests that the individuals in question are actively choosing to attend the event, which would likely indicate a desire to have a good time and enjoy themselves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the question, as they do not have a clear connection to the idea of attending a party.
There are many reasons why someone may want to get in shape, and all of the options provided are valid reasons. Feeling good and desirable can be linked to increased confidence and self-esteem, while sex can be a motivating factor for some. Being overweight can have negative health effects, and avoiding disease is a common reason to improve physical fitness.
The sentence suggests that the sauce was tangy, which is a characteristic commonly associated with horseradish sauce. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "murder" suggests an act of violence and trauma inflicted upon someone, which could cause intense emotional pain and grief for their family members. "Bankruptcy" and "fear" are not directly related to the emotional impact of murder on a family. "Guilty conscience" may be more applicable to the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim's family. "Finding God" is a personal decision that may or may not be related to the effects of murder on a family.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person who is drowning may be revived or rescued if they start breathing again. Breathing is essential for human survival, and not being able to breathe can lead to organ failure and death. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to drowning or physical distress.
The sentence mentions that the meat from the cow farm was provided to the bay area, which is located in Northern California. This suggests that the cow farm is also likely located in that area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker has a negative opinion of the pop band, but is willing to take his daughter to see them despite this because she has a strong preference for them. The word "adore" indicates a strong level of love and admiration, which fits with the idea of a daughter who has a strong desire to see the band. The other options have different meanings that do not quite fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that reproduction is being referred to in a biological sense, which typically results in the production of offspring or children. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or relate to biological reproduction.
The sentence explicitly mentions the Mardi Gras parade, which is a famous festival celebrated in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The options "theatre," "movie house," and "hotel" do not necessarily imply that the person is in New Orleans or would have a view of the Mardi Gras parade. "Outside" is too general, and could refer to any location, whereas "new orleans" is specific and directly related to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that a "talking bee" is not a real, physical presence that can be found in the world, but rather a fictional character that exists in a story book. The other options are all real-world locations where a bee might be found, but they do not fit the context of the question because they do not involve a "talking bee."
County highways are typically found in rural areas rather than in urban areas. They are usually maintained by the county government rather than the state, which is why they are not typically found in highly populated areas. Michigan is a state, but it does not provide any context as to whether or not it is likely to have county highways. "Country" may refer to rural areas, but it is not a specific enough answer choice. "In town" suggests urban areas, which are not likely to have county highways. "Map" is not a relevant answer choice.
The other options are all places where someone can find a desk, but the question is specifically asking where someone can keep a small clock. A desk is a common place to keep a small clock, as it can be easily accessible and visible. The other options do not necessarily have desks, and are not specifically associated with where someone would keep a small clock.
The sentence suggests that the statistician already looked at an attribute, but wants more information about it. A description would provide more details and context about the attribute, allowing the statistician to make more informed decisions or draw more accurate conclusions. The other options, such as calculus or formulas, may be useful in certain statistical analyses, but are not necessarily applicable to this specific sentence. Similarly, an array or a sentence where described do not provide additional information about the attribute itself.
The sentence suggests that someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower while on a tour, and the options provide possible types of tours. "Garage" and "movies" are unlikely to be related to seeing the Eiffel Tower, "in Europe" is too broad and doesn't give a specific tour type, and "Paris" could be a tour option but it doesn't indicate how someone would see the Eiffel Tower. "Bus" is the most logical option as it is a common form of transportation for tours, and many tours in Paris specifically include stops at the Eiffel Tower.
Bathroom towels are typically hung behind the bathroom door, on a towel rack or on hooks. The other options, such as a locker room or hotel, may also provide towels but they would not be stored in the same way as a personal bathroom towel. Cupboards and linen closets may hold towels, but they are not specifically associated with bathroom towels in the same way that behind the bathroom door is.
The sentence suggests that the herding dog had enough space to run and play, which is commonly found in a backyard. The other options do not provide a suitable space for a dog to run and play freely. The neighbor's house and outside are too vague and do not provide a clear location, while the farmyard may not necessarily have enough open space for a dog to play.
Cats are known for having long whiskers, which are sensitive sensory organs used for navigation and detecting their surroundings. While cats also have long claws, legs, and lifespan, these characteristics are not typically described as "long" in the same way that whiskers are. Eyes may be described as large or round, but not necessarily long.
Crossing oneself is a common religious practice in the Catholic faith that is often done in times of stress or anxiety, as it is believed to offer comfort and reassurance. Burning oneself and dying are not typical responses to stress, and teaching or talking to each other may be practices among Catholics but are not specifically mentioned in the question as related to stress.
The sentence suggests that the tool being described is used to make plants wet, which is commonly associated with watering. The sentence also mentions a handle, which indicates that the tool can be carried. The only option that fits both criteria is a watering can. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "your pet's home" implies that the pet in question is likely a bird, which is supported by the presence of a feather. A bird's home is typically a bird cage, which will have loose feathers as birds naturally molt their feathers. The other options do not relate to a bird's home or the presence of feathers.
Eating breakfast is often touted as the best meal of the day because it helps to kickstart the metabolism. After fasting overnight, the body's metabolism slows down, making it harder to burn calories throughout the day. Eating breakfast provides the body with the nutrients it needs to start burning calories and creating energy. Feeling satisfied, having energy, and gaining energy are all related to the metabolism starting up, rather than being the reason why breakfast is the best meal. Having a full stomach may be a result of eating breakfast, but it doesn't explain why it's the best meal of the day.
The word "influence" suggests that the answer relates to politics or government. The most likely person to have influence on Washington from a given county is their representative in Congress, who can advocate for their constituents' interests and push for legislation that benefits their area. The other options (cleverest, bitterest, alter, sweet) do not make sense in this context or are not relevant to the question.
The sentence suggests that being on a balcony can cause someone to feel cold, which may be due to the weather conditions in the location. Antarctica is a known cold and icy continent, making it the most likely option among the choices. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a competitive situation between two people, which usually results in one person winning and the other losing. The other options may be outcomes of a competition, but they do not necessarily reflect the main or most common outcome. "Encouraging" is not a common outcome in competitive situations, "injury" and "frustration" are negative outcomes that are not always present, and "pride" can be felt by both the winner and the loser.
Drinking alcohol can impair a person's ability to function properly and can cause disorientation. This can include difficulty maintaining balance, blurred vision, and impaired judgment. These effects can lead to poor decision-making and decreased reaction time, making it dangerous for a person to operate a vehicle. The other options do not have a clear connection to the topic of drinking and driving.
The sentence suggests that John was frustrated about something related to the bookend he bought. The word "pair" indicates that bookends usually come in twos and are used to hold a pair of books upright on a shelf. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the football field is located on a college campus, as it is a popular spot for many people to gather. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question did something wrong and is now experiencing a negative emotion as a result. The phrase "felt everybody judging him" implies that he is experiencing shame and remorse for his actions, which is a common feeling associated with guilt. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well and do not accurately describe the person's emotional state.
The sentence indicates that Indian restaurants can be found in many locations throughout the world. However, the answer option "more sophisticated town" lacks a clear connection to the context, while "curry" refers to a dish rather than a place. Therefore, the answer must be "large city," as cities typically have a larger population and a more diverse range of culinary options, including ethnic restaurants like Indian cuisine.
The sentence suggests that if a person works hard, their situation will be improved, which likely means they will experience an improvement in their quality of life. Working hard can lead to better job opportunities or promotions, higher salaries, increased job security, and a sense of personal fulfillment. Compliments or acknowledgment may provide a boost to one's self-esteem, but they are not directly connected to improving one's situation. The American Dream is a concept, not a tangible outcome from hard work, and "headache" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people are less concerned with a certain lawn because it is out of view, which would likely refer to a back yard. Front yards are often a point of pride for homeowners and are visible from the street, making them an important part of curb appeal. Golf courses are typically well-maintained and visible to players and spectators alike. A garden may be important to its owner, but would not necessarily be overlooked by others. Suburbia is a place, not a lawn.
A rest area is a designated area on a highway or freeway where drivers can stop to take a break, stretch their legs, use the restroom, and sometimes even sleep. Rest areas often have benches or picnic tables with pillows or cushions for added comfort, but depending on where you are in the rest area, you may not be able to see the pillows or cushions. The other options, such as bedroom, home or kitchen, are more likely to have visible pillows, and "make seat softer" is not a place but a description of an action.
The word "gentleman" suggests a formal or sophisticated context, which is further supported by the option "tuxedo" being among the answer choices. A gentleman might own a tuxedo and wear it to formal events or occasions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence states that dogs are omnivores, meaning they consume both plants and animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be something related to their diet, such as eating meat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the person is an expert in hieroglyphics, which are primarily associated with Ancient Egypt. This suggests that the excavation site is likely to be located in Egypt as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When inflation is present, prices tend to rise due to the decrease in the purchasing power of money. Fighting inflation usually involves measures that decrease the amount of money in circulation, which helps to control price increases. Therefore, we can expect to see lower prices at stores if a country or organization is successful in fighting inflation. The other choices do not make logical sense within the context of the question, as raising interest rates or increasing demand for goods could actually exacerbate inflation.
The question is asking about a common activity between a mother and child, reading stories. The answer can be inferred from the context that the question provides. The other options, such as tall building, British building, mall, and moon, do not make sense in this context.
The word "intensely" suggests that the jogging is being done at a demanding level, which can increase the risk of heart attacks. Intense physical activity can put a strain on the heart, especially in individuals who are not used to such activity or have underlying cardiovascular issues. Blisters may occur from excessive jogging, but they are not a life-threatening condition. While improved health is a potential benefit of regular exercise, the sentence is specifically referring to the negative consequences of too much intense jogging. "Practice for mar-than" is not a valid option.
The question suggests that the cow in question does not exist in reality, meaning it can only be found in fictional sources such as story books. The other options (great outdoors, field, barnyard) all suggest real-life locations where one might find actual cows, and the option toy store suggests a toy cow, which still exists as a physical object. Therefore, the correct answer is story book.
The question is asking specifically for information in audio format, which is commonly found on television through news broadcasts, documentaries, and other programs. Books, articles, and newspapers are typically in written form, and meetings do not necessarily provide audio recordings for information seeking purposes.
The sentence suggests that the person's team is not doing well in the game, which can be a cause of stress and frustration. Excitement and entertainment may be present if the game is being played well, but not if the team is losing. Envy is not a typical emotion in this situation, and anxiousness is only possible if the person is invested in the outcome of the game.
The sentence suggests that Timmy is throwing a newspaper and is unable to throw it far enough to land it on something specific. The word "up" also implies that the target is at a higher level than Timmy. The most likely target in this scenario would be a porch, as newspapers are commonly thrown onto porches. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as newspapers would not typically be thrown onto a library, jail, subway or floor.
The sentence mentions taking measurements with an armband, which is a common method for measuring blood pressure. The doctor's recommendation of medicine suggests that the patient may have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, which requires medication to lower it. None of the other choices have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context indicates that the question is referring to a battle that is not real, which rules out options like Vietnam, Iraq or war as these are real-life situations where battles can occur. A court room battle may involve a conflict or a legal dispute, but it is not a physical battle. A video game, however, often involves virtual battles and conflicts that are created in a simulated world, making it the correct answer.
The sentence is stating that reading books can provide more information on a subject. The phrase "further knowledge" specifically refers to gaining additional understanding or insight on a topic. The other options do not accurately relate to the purpose of reading books for more information.
The sentence suggests that John had access to other sinks but ended up washing dishes somewhere specific. The most logical option would be his own home, as it's unlikely he would be able to use a laboratory or office sink and it's unclear why he would go to his neighbor's house to wash dishes. The laundry room is a possibility, but given that the sentence focuses solely on John's kitchen sink being clogged, it's likely that he used a sink in the kitchen of his home.
The sentence suggests that John is navigating a maze or labyrinth, as he is using a common trick of always keeping one hand on the wall to prevent himself from getting lost or backtracking. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Billy is unable to cook or use his microwave, which are both common ways of preparing food. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Billy needs money to buy food instead. The other options (go on a date, pay bills, get things, control people) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location of the sink is in the bachelor's living space as it mentions that he didn't bother cleaning it. The options chemistry lab, front desk, and laboratory suggest a work or public space, which is unlikely to have a sink that the bachelor would be responsible for cleaning. The laundry room is also less likely as it is not mentioned that the bachelor does his laundry. This leaves us with the option of apartment, which fits with the context of the sentence as it is a common living space with a sink that would require regular cleaning.
The question mentions getting an x-ray of your jaw, which indicates that you are at a dental appointment. Waiting rooms are typically associated with medical and dental offices, but the mention of an x-ray and jaw suggest that the correct answer is a dentist's office. The other choices do not have any clear relevance to the context provided.
The sentence suggests that the man showed a sign of sickness before losing consciousness, which is commonly associated with vomiting. Vomiting can be a symptom of excessive alcohol consumption, which is indicated by the fact that the man had been out for a long night. The other options, such as dream, panic, cancer or blurred vision, do not have any clear connection to the context of excessive alcohol consumption and sickness.
The word "small areas" suggests that the answer should be a type of living space that is compact and efficient. Apartments are commonly associated with smaller living spaces, making them a likely answer. The other choices do not typically offer small living spaces: opera houses are venues for performances, supermarkets are shopping centers, train stations are transportation hubs, and mansions are large, luxurious homes.
The sentence suggests that James's parents were concerned about his spending habits, indicating that the object he puts his coin in is likely associated with a frivolous or extravagant activity. Wishing wells are often associated with making wishes and whimsy, so it is plausible that James is making a wish with his coin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a place where John would take his lawnmower, which implies that he is looking for a tool or service to fix a mechanical problem with the lawnmower. Among the choices, only "repair shop" fits this description. The other options do not provide any useful service for fixing a lawnmower; a car dealership sells cars, a toolkit is a collection of tools and not a place where one can fix equipment, a bar is a place to drink and socialize, and a tool box is simply a container for tools.
The sentence suggests that the girl did not give proper attention or care to the bunny, which is an act of neglect. The other options may describe the girl's attitude towards the bunny, but neglect is the only option that specifically refers to the bunny's suffering as a result of the girl's inaction.
The sentence suggests that the mosquitoes are in danger of being killed by a fly swatter, and it is implied that they need to do something to survive. "Fly away" is a realistic option for the mosquitoes because it is a natural defense mechanism that they possess. The other options are not realistic solutions for the mosquitoes' predicament. "Spread disease" is a negative consequence of mosquitoes, but it does not pertain to their immediate need for survival in this situation. "Swamp" and "bug campers" are not actions that mosquitoes are capable of taking, and "buzz off" is a phrase that implies leaving but does not give a specific action for the mosquitoes to take.
The sentence suggests that attempting to clean the outfit would be futile, implying that the damage to the outfit is irreversible. The word "useless" suggests that the outfit is beyond repair and cannot be salvaged. The other options do not convey the same sense of irreparable damage.
The context of the sentence implies that getting completely dirty is something that is likely to happen to a dog when they are outside. Dogs often enjoy rolling around in dirt or mud when they are outside, which can result in them getting covered in dirt. The other options do not make as much sense as dogs are unlikely to get completely dirty in those contexts.
The sentence describes a man who is exhibiting signs of being heavily intoxicated, such as struggling to walk properly. The word "staggering" specifically means to walk unsteadily or swaying from side to side, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options (falling down, throwing up, getting arrested, turning into a butterfly) do not accurately describe the man's current state or match the context of the sentence.
The act of comforting a friend generally involves physically showing empathy and support through some kind of physical touch or gesture. A hug is a common way to convey these feelings, while a handshake or giving money would not be considered an appropriate way to comfort someone in distress. Feeling bad might be a natural response to a friend's suffering, but it is not an action that would be taken to help them feel better.
The context suggests that the people being referred to are likely members of a religious community or order, given that they refer to each other as "brother" despite not being related by blood. The option "monastery" fits this context best, as it is a place where monks live in a community and refer to each other as "brother." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Boxes of products are typically stored in a warehouse, which is a large space specifically designed for storing and organizing goods. The other options (shoe store, basement, shed, garage) are not typically used for large-scale storage of products.
The sentence suggests that the Canadian traveler visited a location in the southwestern region. While Canada is mentioned as the traveler's country of origin, it is not a viable option since it is not located in the southwestern region. Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico are all states located in the southwestern region of the United States, but only New Mexico is a viable option since it is the only location mentioned in the sentence that the traveler actually visited. Peru is a country located in South America, so it is not a viable option either.
The context of the question refers to a garment worn by the flappers of the 1920s, which were known for their fashion style. The options "iphone," "baggage," and "golf bag" are not related to garment and can be eliminated. The option "brassiere" could be a possible answer, but it is important to note that the question refers specifically to a garment with thin shoulder straps, which is a characteristic commonly associated with a chemise.
The question mentions hunting, which suggests that the answer is related to buying guns for the purpose of hunting. A sporting goods store would be the most likely place to find such guns, as they often sell gear and equipment for sports and outdoor activities, including hunting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
