It also mentions that the man received the toothbrush (rather than buying it) which suggests that he obtained it from a place where toothbrushes are commonly given out for free. Dentist offices commonly offer free toothbrushes to their patients as part of preventative care, making it the most likely option among the given choices. The other options (bedroom, supermarket, drug store, and grocery store) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options (cause accidents, cause illness, pain, lower i.q) do not directly relate to the impact on relationships mentioned in the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "38fc5709f0f4968dac106f08c9276186", "question": {"question_concept": "lock", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "own"}, {"label": "B", "text": "gate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "entrance"}, {"label": "D", "text": "front door"}, {"label": "E", "text": "controlling whether door opened"}], "stem": "What is a person likely to lock at night?"}}, "k": "front door\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the person is locking something for safety or security reasons at night. The options \"own,\" \"gate,\" and \"entrance\" are too broad and could refer to a variety of things. The option \"controlling whether door opened\" does not make sense grammatically and does not fit with the context. Therefore, the correct answer is likely \"front door,\" which is a common feature in most homes and is often locked at night for safety reasons."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "748a2c6d98f50bcb613b8cfacc3afa71", "question": {"question_concept": "door", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "conference room"}, {"label": "B", "text": "theater"}, {"label": "C", "text": "apartment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "office"}, {"label": "E", "text": "neighbor's house"}], "stem": "As the day ended he eyed the door from his desk, work was soon over and he could leave the what?"}}, "k": "office\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions a desk, which is commonly associated with an office. Additionally, the character is looking at a door and waiting for work to end, which suggests that he is in a workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "2c4652e60482e27e7c492827e419c717", "question": {"question_concept": "dance club", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "downtown area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "city hall"}, {"label": "C", "text": "toun"}, {"label": "D", "text": "united states"}, {"label": "E", "text": "downtown district"}], "stem": "Where in a metropolitan area would you likely find a dance club?"}}, "k": "downtown area or downtown district\nKnowledge: Dance clubs are often located in bustling areas with a lot of foot traffic and night life. \"Downtown\" generally refers to the central business district of a city, which often has a lot of nightlife options including bars and clubs. \"City hall\" is the government building in a city and would not likely have a dance club. \"Town\" and \"United States\" are too broad and generic to be specific enough for locating a specific type of establishment."}

This is reinforced by the fact that the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. \"Help people\" or \"be helpful\" would suggest that she was doing something for others, while \"get dressed\" would suggest that she was preparing to go somewhere. \"Gain\" does not make sense in this context."}

In a household setting, it is common to put clean dishes in the kitchen cupboard to store them until they are needed again. The other options (flea market, restaurant, and outside) do not make sense in the context of everyday dish-washing at home, and the dishwasher is where the plate would be washed, not stored."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "aec2a4d9c8417722ea0f621fba6d3dbc", "question": {"question_concept": "apple tree", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "pennsylvania"}, {"label": "B", "text": "across the street"}, {"label": "C", "text": "front yard"}, {"label": "D", "text": "countryside"}, {"label": "E", "text": "park"}], "stem": "Where is a good place to plant an apple tree you just bought?"}}, "k": "front yard\nKnowledge: Apple trees require a lot of sunlight to grow and bear fruit, so planting them in a location that gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day is important. The front yard is often a good choice because it is usually the most accessible and visible location, and it also tends to receive more sunlight than other parts of the property. Planting the apple tree across the street or in a park is not a practical or viable option. Pennsylvania and countryside are not specific enough locations to determine whether they would be good places to plant an apple tree."}

However, not all water is suitable for them. Jellyfish are typically found in oceans and other bodies of salt water, where they can thrive. The other options, such as a store, a Japanese restaurant, and Hawaii, do not have any clear connection to the habitat requirements of jellyfish. The choice \"see\" is also unlikely since jellyfish generally cannot survive outside of water."}

Therefore, the best answer is \"prepare.\""}

This suggests that the crust is not thick, but rather thin and crunchy. The other options do not accurately describe the texture or size of the crust."}

The term \"dimly lit\" is commonly used to refer to a space that does not have much light, hence it is the correct answer. The other options (synagogue, sunlight, birthday cake, bedroom) do not necessarily suggest a lack of light in the surrounding environment."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "f037e216191f298d9e4636ceb195eced", "question": {"question_concept": "wool", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "clothing store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sweater"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fabric store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "jewelry"}, {"label": "E", "text": "clothing factory"}], "stem": "Where could you get something that is made out of wool but cannot be worn?"}}, "k": "jewelry\nKnowledge: The question implies that the item made out of wool cannot be worn, which rules out options such as clothing stores, sweaters, and clothing factories. The remaining options are fabric stores and jewelry, but it is unlikely that a fabric store would sell non-wearable wool items. Therefore, the correct answer must be jewelry. Wool can be used to make various types of jewelry, such as necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, which are not intended to be worn as clothing."}

This is likely due to the personal nature of the topic, and the potential for gossip or unwanted advice. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotions that may arise from discussing marital issues with friends."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "614782bd1270af73b09d3bb902401974", "question": {"question_concept": "boat", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "lake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "football ground"}, {"label": "D", "text": "harbor"}, {"label": "E", "text": "ocean"}], "stem": "What small area is likely to have a boat?"}}, "k": "lake\nKnowledge: A lake is a small body of water, often surrounded by land and commonly used for recreational activities such as boating. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of a boat; water and ocean are too broad, a football ground is not typically associated with boats, and a harbor is a specific location where boats dock rather than a place where boats are commonly found."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "cc68f668ee60686e34bac9b56df3d79f", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "conference"}, {"label": "B", "text": "town"}, {"label": "C", "text": "apartment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "wedding"}, {"label": "E", "text": "theater"}], "stem": "Which location has spots where people can take their kids to play on playgrounds?"}}, "k": "town \nKnowledge: The keyword in the question is \"playgrounds,\" which is generally associated with public places. Among the given options, only \"town\" can be a place where people can take their kids to play on playgrounds because towns may have public parks and recreational areas where playgrounds are present. The other options, such as conference, apartment, wedding, and theater, do not have any clear connection to children playing or playgrounds."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "da68f26cae8adeb043c487cb5c181d86", "question": {"question_concept": "bedroom", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "dwelling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "apartment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bed and breakfast"}, {"label": "D", "text": "at hotel"}, {"label": "E", "text": "loft"}], "stem": "The bedroom is pretty much the only room, that's the common layout where?"}}, "k": "apartment\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the specific layout being described is commonly found in a certain type of living space. The word \"dwelling\" could refer to any type of housing, so it is too general. \"Bed and breakfast\" and \"hotel\" may have specific layouts for bedrooms, but they are not necessarily standard or common. A \"loft\" may be a unique or non-standard living space where the layout of the bedroom may vary. Therefore, the correct answer is \"apartment,\" which typically has a standard layout where the bedroom is the only private room."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "4751d2f3e12d3f8c4e0aee2eda60fbea", "question": {"question_concept": "alcohol", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "become inebriated"}, {"label": "B", "text": "socialize"}, {"label": "C", "text": "eating"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sleep at night"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dance"}], "stem": "When hearing music while drinking alcohol, what are people likely to do?"}}, "k": "dance\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between listening to music and drinking alcohol, and that people are likely to engage in a specific activity as a result. Dancing is a common activity associated with listening to music in social settings, especially when alcohol is involved. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence or do not logically follow from the information given."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "8227808601990c553880652de6742ee4", "question": {"question_concept": "bare", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "covered"}, {"label": "B", "text": "empity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bareword"}, {"label": "D", "text": "full"}, {"label": "E", "text": "ample"}], "stem": "His bare arms were flexing as he carried the wood inside, what was the status of his grasp?"}}, "k": "full\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the man was carrying something, which was later identified as wood. Additionally, the description of his arms flexing suggests that he was carrying a heavy load. Thus, the correct answer is likely \"full,\" as this suggests that his grasp was holding the maximum amount of wood that he could carry at once. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "f62a688e7537940dc0b52e3151dcd4ad", "question": {"question_concept": "harmonica", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "country band"}, {"label": "B", "text": "blues band"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pocket"}, {"label": "D", "text": "music store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "rock band"}], "stem": "Where would be an unusual place for a harmonica?"}}, "k": "pocket\nKnowledge: A harmonica is a small and portable instrument that can easily fit into someone's pocket. Therefore, while it could be found in a music store or used by a country or blues band, it would be unexpected to find a harmonica in a rock band or any other setting where it couldn't be easily carried around or played on the go."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "38fcf1a9f1e51c726972889655470144", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "accomplish goals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "get laid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "popularity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "headache"}, {"label": "E", "text": "successful"}], "stem": "The man spent the weekend with his girlfriend. What is he likely to have done?"}}, "k": "get laid\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence, which mentions the man spending the weekend with his girlfriend, suggests that the likely activity he engaged in is sexual relations with her. The phrase \"get laid\" is a slang phrase that refers to having sex, and is commonly used in this context. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence, and do not make sense in this context."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "59130c7be3e66d7df8fe5cb174a3da4e", "question": {"question_concept": "kill", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "take life"}, {"label": "B", "text": "or dies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "feel remorse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "shoot"}, {"label": "E", "text": "murder"}], "stem": "What is the goal of someone planning to kill?"}}, "k": "murder\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is planning to take the life of another person, which is commonly known as murder. The other options do not accurately describe the act of intentionally and unlawfully causing someone's death. \"Take life\" is a more general phrase, \"or dies\" is not a goal but rather an outcome, \"feel remorse\" is an emotional response rather than a goal, and \"shoot\" could apply to a variety of situations where killing is not the intent."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "2cccbc9324a3c64753186c2e72248004", "question": {"question_concept": "winning", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "compete"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "celebrate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bragging"}, {"label": "E", "text": "cash in"}], "stem": "What could result in winning?"}}, "k": "compete or cash in\nKnowledge: Winning is often associated with competing, as it implies coming out on top in a contest or competition. It can also be associated with cashing in, as winning a prize or jackpot often results in a financial reward. Celebrating and bragging may be the result of winning, but they are not necessarily the direct cause of it. Fun is a subjective experience and does not necessarily lead to winning."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "35d3ac7e1f5485924695ca3e463c117d", "question": {"question_concept": "talking", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "listening to"}, {"label": "B", "text": "communication"}, {"label": "C", "text": "telling a story"}, {"label": "D", "text": "revelation"}, {"label": "E", "text": "conversation"}], "stem": "Talking and writing are forms of what?"}}, "k": "communication\nKnowledge: The sentence is comparing two forms of expression - talking and writing - and is looking for a term that encompasses both. Communication is the broadest term that covers both talking and writing as methods of sharing information and ideas with others. Telling a story is a more specific action that can be included within the broader category of communication. Revelation is also a form of communicating information, but it is not as commonly associated with talking and writing. Listening to and conversation are not broad enough terms to encompass both talking and writing."}

The option \"take trips\" makes sense because older people may have more free time and resources to travel, whereas young people may be busy with school or work. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as there is no mention of emotional reactions or physical changes."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "c993c4afe371297dbfbb78bec8832d08", "question": {"question_concept": "learn", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "intelligent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "have more knowledge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "increase knowledge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "factual"}, {"label": "E", "text": "empowering"}], "stem": "The teacher was explaining how important it is to learn all you can, she said it can get you anywhere and is very what?"}}, "k": "empowering\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher believes that learning all you can is important because it can lead to success in various areas of life. The word \"empowering\" implies that gaining knowledge can give someone a sense of control or confidence in achieving their goals. The other options all relate to the concept of learning and knowledge, but do not convey the idea of empowerment that is present in the sentence."}

What did he probablt find them in?"}}, "k": "attic\nKnowledge: The word \"old\" suggests that John may have found the pictures in a place where items are typically stored for a long time, such as an attic. None of the other options are commonly associated with storing personal photos."}

They may also be attracted to sites with warmth and shelter, such as cupboards. The other options (on the couch, Disneyland, garage) do not provide ideal living conditions for mice."}

The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A gurney is a type of stretcher used to transport patients, a person refers to a human being, and arteries and veins are blood vessels within the body but are not locations where a blood transfusion would take place."}

A palace may also be large and spacious, but it would be unlikely to be rented out like a cabin. Spacecraft, hall, and liner do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Where might that wall have been?"}}, "k": "machines\nKnowledge: Ball bearings are commonly used in machinery to reduce friction and allow parts to move smoothly. Therefore, it is likely that the wall Dan found the ball bearings behind was part of a machine or mechanical system. The other answer choices - high quality motor, skatepark, church, and can - do not suggest any connection to ball bearings or machinery."}

The other options (except for purse) suggest places where he might typically keep his keys, but the sentence does not suggest that he left them in any of those places. Therefore, outside is the best option based on the context provided."}

A container is a logical solution for storing coffee as it helps to keep it fresh and prevents spills. A cryogenic pod and train station do not make sense in this context. A cup is only suitable if the coffee will be consumed shortly after it is made, and an internet cafe has no relevance to coffee storage."}

A hallway and house are not light sources, leaving only the candle as a possible correct answer. Additionally, candles have been used as a light source for thousands of years, making them a well-known and common alternative to electrically powered lights."}

The other options (medium, water fountain, wishing well, desk) do not make sense as they are not typical places to store coins while on the go."}

The other options do not necessarily indicate a deviation from normalcy in the same way, with \"orthodox\" possibly indicating adherence to traditional norms, \"ill\" indicating a medical condition, \"reverse\" indicating opposition or reversal, and \"tangential\" indicating a connection only indirectly related to the topic at hand."}

Additionally, the phrase \"not in the garbage\" suggests that the litter is not being disposed of properly, making it likely to end up on the ground or roadside."}

The option \"criminal trial\" fits the context of the sentence as it refers specifically to a legal trial for a crime. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Chicken can be served in many types of dishes, such as roasted chicken, chicken curry, or chicken stir-fry. \"Freezer\" and \"eaten\" are not ways of serving chicken, but rather refer to how it is stored or consumed. \"Plate\" is too broad and could apply to any food item, and \"fast food restaurant\" is a specific location where chicken may be served, but does not describe the actual serving method."}

Easter is often associated with the arrival of spring and the symbol of new beginnings, which makes it a logical answer to the question. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question."}

Among the options provided, the library is the most likely to have resources for learning and education. While the other options might also have shelves or areas for toys, they are less likely to be focused on educational resources."}

Additionally, being outside in nature and breathing fresh air can have a calming and refreshing effect on the mind and body, which may help you make better decisions. The other options do not have a clear connection to the benefits of breathing fresh air for decision-making."}

The other options (better mood, smiling, feeling better, being excited) could also result from having fun with loved ones, but feeling happy is the most likely outcome as it is the most commonly associated positive emotion with social interactions."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "e29113a6fbfc0e2d3fc6708c9a018ec8", "question": {"question_concept": "index card", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "office supply store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "library"}, {"label": "C", "text": "address book"}, {"label": "D", "text": "oral report"}, {"label": "E", "text": "card catalogue"}], "stem": "He liked to write every address out on an index card, then he would sort and store them in his what?"}}, "k": "card catalogue\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a system for organizing addresses that involves writing them on index cards and sorting them. A card catalogue is a common system used in libraries to organize information on index cards. This suggests that the person may have a similar system for organizing addresses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

If you are about to be pinned, what should you try to do?"}}, "k": "get free\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence describes wrestling as a contest where two people try to pin each other to the ground. Therefore, if one is about to be pinned, the logical goal would be to get free and avoid losing the match. The other options are irrelevant or inappropriate in this context."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "475e00e21587b99646deb52ce5cba306", "question": {"question_concept": "ficus", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "a greenhouse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pots"}, {"label": "C", "text": "conservatory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "front yard"}, {"label": "E", "text": "california"}], "stem": "Where might someone find many varieties of ficus?"}}, "k": "a greenhouse\nKnowledge: The question is asking about a location where someone might find many varieties of ficus, which indicates that the answer is related to plant cultivation or sale. A greenhouse is a structure designed for growing plants, and is likely to have a larger variety of plants than a single pot or front yard. A conservatory is also a possible location for plant cultivation, but is less commonly used than a greenhouse. California might have a warm climate suitable for growing ficus, but it is a general location and does not specify a particular place where many varieties of ficus can be found."}

While some of the other choices may involve education, such as classrooms or homeschooling, they do not necessarily imply a higher level of education. University, on the other hand, is a well-known institution that offers higher education in a variety of fields and is often the next step for students after completing high school."}

Calling 911 would be inappropriate, as it is for emergency situations. Electrical circuit and airport have no relevance to the issue of internet connectivity. Computer network may be a possible option, but it is more likely that the person needs to contact their internet service provider, which is typically referred to as a \"company\" that provides internet services."}

The word \"mandatory\" means \"required by law or rules,\" which fits the context of the sentence. The other options, such as \"shall\" and \"required,\" are also suggestive of obligation, but less directly so than \"mandatory.\" \"Necessary\" and \"essential\" do not convey the sense of obligation that the sentence implies."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "92ae2d4f9837285e5363b94cb1828643", "question": {"question_concept": "body", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "zombie"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bodycam"}, {"label": "C", "text": "coffin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "graveyard"}, {"label": "E", "text": "funeral"}], "stem": "Where does my body go after I am no longer living?"}}, "k": "coffin or graveyard\nKnowledge: The question is asking about what happens to a body after death. Typically, a deceased person's body is placed in a coffin and either buried in a graveyard or cremated. A zombie is a fictional character that is not related to the process of death and disposal of a body. Bodycam is a small camera worn by police officers and has no relationship to the question at hand. A funeral is a ceremony that takes place before burial or cremation, and is not indicative of what happens to the body afterward."}

The only option that fits this context is \"making love.\" Insomnia, pregnancy, and rest are all activities that might interfere with going to bed, but they do not involve active engagement like making love. Additionally, an infant might prevent a couple from sleeping, but it does not necessarily prevent them from going to bed."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "a186948ea5243c1b99cf744dbccf4b92", "question": {"question_concept": "have lunch", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "too full"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "get food"}, {"label": "D", "text": "find food"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stop working"}], "stem": "Why do you not earn money while you have lunch?"}}, "k": "stop working\nKnowledge: The question suggests that there is a reason why someone might not earn money while they have lunch, and the answer choice \"stop working\" is the most logical. When someone is working, they are typically earning money. When they stop working, they stop earning money. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question, as they are all related to eating food rather than earning money."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "5e1176ed8ab37d2e77abfa0efc196c59", "question": {"question_concept": "computers", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "be smart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "advance knowledge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "follow instructions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "produce sound"}, {"label": "E", "text": "do work"}], "stem": "Billy didn't understand computers but he could work them.  This was because he could easily do what?"}}, "k": "follow instructions\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was able to use computers despite not understanding them, indicating that he was likely able to follow instructions or step-by-step processes to accomplish tasks on the computer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "76562874af24eaa8ac1fec9b01a6c6b7", "question": {"question_concept": "entertaining", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "suicide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fulfillment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "embarrassment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fatigue"}, {"label": "E", "text": "laughter"}], "stem": "The man had been entertaining his whole life, being in his nineties now doing a show can lead to what?"}}, "k": "fulfillment\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the man has been entertaining for his entire life and is now in his nineties, which implies that he enjoys performing and finds fulfillment in it. The other options do not make sense in this context - suicide and embarrassment seem unlikely outcomes, fatigue may be a concern but is not the most logical choice, and laughter is a potential result of the show but does not address the question of how the man might feel about it."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "5d398fd2a79c6a406a4c422b4fe0692b", "question": {"question_concept": "eating breakfast", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "gas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "dirty dishes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "get distracted"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bad breath"}, {"label": "E", "text": "being satisfied"}], "stem": "Why would you be eating breakfast?"}}, "k": "being satisfied\nKnowledge: Breakfast is commonly known as the first meal of the day and is often eaten to provide energy and nutrients after a prolonged period of fasting during sleep. Being satisfied is a common reason for eating breakfast, as it can help to curb hunger and provide necessary sustenance to start the day. The other options (gas, dirty dishes, get distracted, bad breath) do not provide a logical reason for eating breakfast."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "c158a0f0bd7cbd283d6eae94f15b5c19", "question": {"question_concept": "thick", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "free flowing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sweet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "unacquainted"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sparse"}, {"label": "E", "text": "slender"}], "stem": "Thick molasses isn't what?"}}, "k": "free flowing\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that something is not free flowing, and since the subject is thick molasses, it is safe to assume that the correct answer should have an opposite meaning to that. Thick molasses is thick, viscous, and does not flow easily, so it is not free flowing. The other options, such as sweet, unacquainted, sparse, and slender, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "0ec9fe408c6784486e092b98a782997e", "question": {"question_concept": "play violin", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "buy earplugs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "inspiring"}, {"label": "C", "text": "guitar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "make music"}, {"label": "E", "text": "like music"}], "stem": "What does hearing someone play violin beautifully make you?"}}, "k": "inspired\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that hearing someone play violin beautifully has a certain effect on the listener. The word \"beautifully\" implies that the music is pleasing to the ear, and the listener's emotional response is described as a feeling of being \"made\" or influenced in some way. The word \"inspiring\" conveys a sense of being moved to take action or create something oneself, which is a common reaction to experiencing beauty in art. The other options either do not fit the context or are not related to the musical instrument mentioned."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "c89d228b7dd8c26e1e5a0442d99c77de", "question": {"question_concept": "call", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "communicate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "answer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "attracting ducks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hang up"}, {"label": "E", "text": "respond"}], "stem": "He kept calling but to no avail, what was he hoping to get?"}}, "k": "answer\nKnowledge: The phrase \"kept calling but to no avail\" suggests that the person was expecting a response from someone they were trying to contact. The word \"answer\" is a synonym for response, making it the most likely option. The other choices, such as \"communicate\" or \"attracting ducks,\" do not fit the context of the sentence. \"Hang up\" is the opposite of what the person was hoping to achieve, and therefore cannot be the correct answer."}

The option \"going to jail\" is the most logical choice as it implies punishment for the action. The other options do not make sense in the context of intentionally starting a fire. \"Warmth\" and \"feel cold\" are about physical sensations, while \"death\" implies a more severe consequence than going to jail."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "9c68058e1a3a9c3af7895da6d0070c0a", "question": {"question_concept": "chess board", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "park"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ymca"}, {"label": "C", "text": "house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "room"}, {"label": "E", "text": "germany"}], "stem": "What is a place that could have hundreds of thousands of chess board?"}}, "k": "house\nKnowledge: The question asks for a place where one could have hundreds of thousands of chess board, which suggests that the place must be large enough to accommodate a significant number of items. A house, particularly a large one or a mansion, could have enough space to store a collection of that size. Parks and YMCA facilities are typically public spaces and would not have enough room for such large collections. Germany is a country and is not a specific location that could hold a large number of chess boards. A room could potentially hold a few chess boards, but not hundreds of thousands."}

A footstool is commonly used to provide extra comfort while sitting at a desk for extended periods of time. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they are not typically associated with desk work or sitting for long periods of time."}

The term \"paper clips\" suggests that the answer is related to a small office supply item. The options \"university\" and \"work\" are too broad and do not specifically relate to paper clips. \"Desktop\" is also too broad and does not necessarily imply a large quantity of paper clips. \"Fashioned into simple tools\" is too specific and not a common use for paper clips. \"Drawer\" is the most likely answer as it is a common storage location for paper clips and could potentially hold tens of thousands of them."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "66bf03c31d805c161065d50362c7af29", "question": {"question_concept": "bar", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "airport"}, {"label": "B", "text": "restaurant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "michigan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "public house"}, {"label": "E", "text": "las vegas"}], "stem": "When John flew to a new state he didn't know where any of the bars where.  He eventually found something that wasn't a bar but still served drinks. What might he have found?"}}, "k": "restaurant\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John was looking for a place to drink alcohol, but he didn't know where any of the bars were. The fact that he eventually found something that wasn't a bar but still served drinks indicates that he may have found a restaurant. Many restaurants serve alcoholic beverages, and they are also commonly found in areas where bars are located. The other options, such as an airport, a specific state (Michigan), a public house, or Las Vegas do not seem as likely based on the context provided."}

He wanted to share his love with everyone, to express it.  He wanted to do what all the time."}}, "k": "live life\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John's desire to express his love and share it with others was motivated by a feeling of being \"higher\" or happier. From this, we can infer that he simply wants to enjoy life to the fullest and experience joy in everything he does. Sharing naughty photos of himself would be inappropriate and unrelated to expressing love, and proposing to a woman or kissing may be specific actions related to romantic love, but do not necessarily capture the broader idea of living life to the fullest. Singing may be a form of expression, but it is not necessarily tied to living life in general."}

Bald eagles are known for building their nests in trees that are located on top of tall cliffs or in other similarly high locations. Because of the lofty location of an eyrie, a bald eagle could indeed see for miles around. The other options are not likely locations for an eagle's nest, and they do not specifically relate to the question's context."}

This suggests that the correct answer will relate to how the divorce could impact the children. \"Bad feelings\" and \"two christmas's\" are not clear indicators of negative consequences for the children. \"Richer\" and \"freedom\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence. \"Emotional distress\" is a common concern for parents going through a divorce as it can have lasting effects on the children's emotional well-being."}

A convention is a large gathering of people with a common interest, such as a trade or profession. At a convention, attendees typically have access to keynote speakers, workshops, exhibit halls, and networking opportunities. Schools, operas, weddings, and bus stops do not typically provide updates about industry news, making them poor choices for this question."}

The other options do not seem relevant to the context. Noise may occur if the cup is set down heavily, spillage can occur if the cup is set down unevenly or if there is liquid inside, clutter is unlikely unless cups are left on the table for an extended period of time, and the cup getting cold is also possible but not directly related to the action of setting it down on the table."}

The other options such as luck, challenge, and desire to win may play a role in the outcome of a competition, but they do not necessarily guarantee a win.

The options \"fish market,\" \"clam chowder,\" \"cooking pot,\" and \"tidepools\" do not fit this description, leaving \"Chesapeake Bay\" as the correct answer. The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary that spans across Maryland and Virginia and is known for its abundant blue crabs."}

Ships are often used for transportation over long distances, and heading east could indicate a journey towards Asia, Europe, or Africa, which are typically located in the eastern hemisphere. The other options do not give any clear indication of why someone would go into a ship."}

The option \"feeling satisfied\" directly aligns with this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - \"gas\", \"bloated\", and \"full stomach\" imply discomfort rather than satisfaction, while \"have energy\" is not necessarily related to the amount of food eaten."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Windows are typically made of glass and provide a view of the outside or inside of a space. The other options, such as dishwasher or cabinet, do not typically have glass barriers through which dishes can be seen."}

The other options do not make sense in this context. A landfill would be an unlikely place to see someone typing on a keyboard, as would a music store or using a camera. \"Finger\" is not a location where someone would be typing but a body part used for typing."}

The other options do not involve the use of a spoon for eating, so they can be ruled out. In addition, the phrase \"bowl of soup\" specifically mentions a food item that is commonly consumed using a spoon."}

A street corner is typically the location where two blocks meet, and it's a common place to find mailboxes. The other options (front door, post office, apartment complex, fence) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The option \"remember everything\" is a logical and plausible reason for why the elephant was asked to recall the number, as it suggests that the elephant has a remarkable ability to remember things. The other options, such as \"breathe\" or \"experience sadness,\" do not have any logical connection to why the elephant would be asked to recall a number."}

Scoring and dribbling refer to actions within playing basketball, but do not indicate a location. Park is the most likely option, as it is a common location for outdoor recreational activities, including basketball."}

Therefore, \"sell stock\" is the best answer, as it is the most direct way for an investor to convert an asset into cash."}

Where was it in relation to the building?"}}, "k": "front\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John's parking space was in a favorable location. The word \"front\" suggests that the space was located near the entrance or main part of the building, which would make it easier for John to access. The other options, including \"jar,\" \"universe,\" \"box,\" and \"answer,\" do not make sense in the context of the sentence and therefore cannot be the correct answer."}

The word \"green\" suggests that the insects are consuming some sort of plant matter, which would be most likely found in a field or other green areas. The other options, such as air, rock, or Arctic, do not provide any obvious sources of green matter for insects to eat. A log may have some moss or algae growing on it that insects could feed on, but it is less likely than a field."}

He picked a place that was fancy and upscale, expensive.  Where might he be staying?"}}, "k": "hotel\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John was unable to find an affordable place to stay, so he decided to splurge on a fancy and upscale option. The most likely option would be a hotel, as hotels are known for offering luxurious and expensive accommodations. The other choices, such as a city or Mexico, do not offer any clues as to where John might be staying. A motel is typically a budget option rather than an upscale one, and a restaurant is not a typical place to stay overnight."}

Passing sentence refers to the formal declaration of a person's punishment after being found guilty of a crime. The other options do not make sense in this context; instructing the jury happens before a verdict is reached, fighting and wrestling are not typical actions for a judge to take, and illustrating a point is not related to the situation described."}

The phrase \"go getter\" implies that they are proactive and always looking for opportunities to succeed. The phrase \"hard worker\" reinforces this idea. The phrase \"liked being in the company\" suggests that the person enjoys being around others, which may be important for networking and advancing in their career. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. \"Keep busy\" is redundant with \"hard worker,\" \"labor in vain\" is the opposite of ambition, \"wait for a raise\" implies passivity, and \"briefcase\" is unrelated."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "2930eff0e6cf124995f63f8ed26731a0", "question": {"question_concept": "go to work", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "earn money"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "take bus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "make money"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sleep"}], "stem": "His cupboards were barren, so he had to go to work so he could what?"}}, "k": "eat\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person's cupboards were empty, which suggests that they did not have any food to eat. Therefore, they had to go to work to earn money in order to buy food. The other options, such as taking a bus or sleeping, do not relate to the context of needing to go to work in order to satisfy a basic human need like hunger."}

In the end, when the dog is shot, he finds himself doing what?"}}, "k": "crying\nKnowledge: The fact that James is watching a film suggests that he is likely emotionally invested in the story and characters. The detail about the dog being shot implies that this is a sad or tragic moment in the film. The option \"crying\" is the most logical choice as it is a common emotional response to a sad event in a film. The other options are unlikely to be the correct answer as they do not fit with the emotional tone of the sentence or the context of James watching a film."}

Fairgrounds are a common location for these types of events, and it makes sense that sheep would go there to participate in a show. Walmart, wolf, and meadow do not have any clear connection to this context, and while farms may have sheep, they would not typically be a location for a sheep show."}

Resting and tiredness are not relevant to the question, as they are not opposite actions to beginning work. Accomplishing and momentum also have no clear connection to the context of the question."}

This implies that God has a creative imagination, as the platypus is not a typical or expected animal. The other options (store, synagogue, everything) are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any clues about what the creation of the platypus indicates about God. While compassion is a characteristic often associated with God, it is not directly referenced in the sentence."}

The other options, such as a record store or car, may be places where vinyl records could be purchased or listened to, but they are not the actual method of playing the vinyl record. Omlinr and wallpaper are not related to vinyl records or playing music."}

While all cats might cross roads, drink water, excrete, and breathe air, not all cats develop cancer. Cancer is a disease that affects some cats but not all, so it is the correct answer in this context."}

The term \"bedside\" further emphasizes this association, as it refers to a table that is typically positioned next to the bed for easy access during the night. The other options, such as school room and classroom, do not have any relevance to the context of the question. An allen key is a tool used to assemble furniture, and a coffee table is typically located in a living room or other common area."}

A table or desk may not provide enough protection for stamps from dust or damage, while a suitcase is not a typical storage option for stamps. A cabinet could work, but drawers are a more common and practical option for small items like stamps."}

Excessive drinking is a known risk factor for a range of health problems, including liver disease, heart disease, and some cancers. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they focus on acute outcomes rather than long-term health consequences."}

Some people thought that he was irresponsible, but Sarah insisted he was just what?"}}, "k": "carefree\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe did not worry or stress about small things, which is a characteristic commonly associated with being carefree. The other options imply negative qualities like not caring at all, being indifferent or careless, or having an inflated sense of self-importance (arrogant). Sarah's insistence that Joe was just carefree implies that she sees this as a positive quality rather than a negative one."}

The term \"pleasurable\" is a likely fit for the context of the sentence as it indicates a positive experience. The other options do not fit the context as they are either negative experiences (deafness and tinnitus) or do not convey enjoyment (relaxing and fun)."}

The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are unrelated to exercise and physical health."}

Attending school would provide Jane with the knowledge and resources she needs to achieve her goal. While reading books or visiting museums can be great resources for learning about animals, these options may not provide the comprehensive education that attending school would offer. Memorizing names without understanding the underlying biology and classification systems may not be practical or useful in the long run."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "612db5b339c596bed4e98500ed5a8613", "question": {"question_concept": "human", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "one body"}, {"label": "B", "text": "muscles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "mouth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "two arms"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stupidity"}], "stem": "A human is fragile, so you should take care since you only get what?"}}, "k": "one body\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that humans are fragile and should be taken care of, which implies that the answer involves something related to the body. The phrase \"you only get\" suggests that this is something that cannot be replaced or obtained again. Muscles, mouth, and two arms are specific parts of the body, but the sentence refers to the body as a whole. Stupidity is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is \"one body\" which emphasizes the importance of taking care of one's physical health."}

The mention of vaccines and erections do not logically connect with the context of the sentence, and nightmares and dreams do not imply the same level of concern as the other options."}

Some common uses for computers include creating documents, analyzing data, communicating with others, and accessing information. While it is possible that someone might use a computer for stress relief, pleasure, or to conquer the world in a hypothetical scenario, these options are not typically associated with the practical reasons people use computers in their daily lives."}

She took a message and passed it on.  It was important, about a big project.  Where might Jenny be?"}}, "k": "office\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Jenny's job involves answering the phone and taking messages, which is a task commonly associated with office work. The message she received is also described as important and related to a big project, which suggests a professional setting rather than a personal one like a friend's house or a party. Therefore, the best answer is office."}

The answer that makes the most sense is \"United States,\" since all of these cities are located in the United States, where there are many highways. The other options (repairs, desert, atlas, countryside) do not provide a logical answer to the question."}

A restaurant or rest area may have many seats, but they would likely not all be couches, and not everyone would be sitting on them. An apartment or neighbor's house would not have many couches with people sitting on them unless there was a gathering or event taking place. A waiting room, on the other hand, commonly has many couches or chairs where people wait for appointments, meetings, or other events."}

Standing at a cross, church services, and ceremony are not specific locations where one would typically find an altar."}

Where does he go to check his breaker box?"}}, "k": "basement\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill's power is out, which indicates that there is likely an issue with his electrical system. If this is the case, he would need to check his breaker box, which is typically located in the basement or another utility room. The other options do not make sense in this context and are not related to electrical systems."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "3ec1b83a298e54a8f99cfcabe29b7b1e", "question": {"question_concept": "light source", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "dard"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sky"}, {"label": "C", "text": "books"}, {"label": "D", "text": "candle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "house"}], "stem": "What would you need a light source to use?"}}, "k": "candle\nKnowledge: The other options do not necessarily require a light source to use. The context of the sentence suggests that the answer should be something that you need to see in the dark. The only option that fits this description is a candle, as it provides a portable source of light that can be carried around with you."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "a155929571ff290dac44fbadd3e62a68", "question": {"question_concept": "number", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "telephone book"}, {"label": "B", "text": "math problem"}, {"label": "C", "text": "chinese takeaway menu"}, {"label": "D", "text": "statistic"}, {"label": "E", "text": "roulette wheel"}], "stem": "A number is the usual response to what?"}}, "k": "math problem\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that a number is a common answer to something, and the options provide a list of different things that could require an answer. However, only math problems typically have a numerical answer. Telephone books provide contact information, Chinese takeaway menus list food options, statistics involve data analysis, and roulette wheels involve chance. Therefore, the correct answer must be a math problem, where a numerical answer is expected."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "1d81b9150588c11ec7e5ba1d5aae341e", "question": {"question_concept": "seeing people play game", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "hunger"}, {"label": "B", "text": "boredom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "entertainment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "longing"}, {"label": "E", "text": "enjoyable"}], "stem": "Seeing people play the game made Victor remember when he played the game.  He experienced something, remembering his past.  What might he have felt?"}}, "k": "longing\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Victor experienced something emotional when he saw people playing the game and remembered his own experience playing it. The word \"remember\" implies that he had a positive experience playing the game, and the fact that he felt something when he saw others playing it suggests that he misses that experience. The word \"longing\" best fits the context of the sentence, indicating a strong desire to experience that feeling again. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "d2ad8c34663e5c3f210880b540eb8bba", "question": {"question_concept": "watch film", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "open eyes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "go to movies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "have eyes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "wear glasses"}, {"label": "E", "text": "have netflix"}], "stem": "There's an obvious prerequisite to being able to watch film, and that is to what?"}}, "k": "have eyes\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions a prerequisite for watching a film, and it is stated explicitly that this requirement is related to vision. The correct answer, therefore, must be an option that confirms the necessity of having functional eyes, which is required to see the images on screen. The other options are not relevant, as they either describe actions (such as going to the movies or opening one's eyes) or possessions (glasses or Netflix) that are not directly related to the ability to see."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "62c8adc02b7195c213626c315788f96a", "question": {"question_concept": "driving to work", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "car crash"}, {"label": "B", "text": "getting there"}, {"label": "C", "text": "transportation cost"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stress"}, {"label": "E", "text": "road rage"}], "stem": "What might make a person stop driving to work and instead take the bus?"}}, "k": "transportation cost\nKnowledge: The question is asking about a reason someone might stop driving to work and take the bus instead. One factor that could influence this decision is the cost of transportation. If driving to work becomes too expensive due to factors such as gas prices or tolls, it may be more cost-effective to take public transportation like a bus. The other options do not necessarily relate to the decision to take the bus over driving."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "dd97faa4cc523ae91a438a97bfd06ec5", "question": {"question_concept": "cold", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "warm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "amiable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "clothed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "prepared"}, {"label": "E", "text": "baking"}], "stem": "If you need to travel in the cold, you would be best to be what?"}}, "k": "prepared\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is traveling in cold weather, which would require preparation with warm clothing and gear. Being warm is important, but it is implied that being prepared with the right clothing is necessary to achieve that warmth. Being amiable or baking have no relation to traveling in cold weather, and being clothed is a basic necessity that is assumed in the context."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "cc8ce6409c110f75438e54d1308e6d3f", "question": {"question_concept": "humans", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "lay eggs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "feel comfortable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "work hard"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fall in love"}, {"label": "E", "text": "kiss"}], "stem": "What do all humans want to do with other people of the opposite sex?"}}, "k": "fall in love\nKnowledge: The question is asking for a universal desire that all humans have in relation to people of the opposite sex. While laying eggs, feeling comfortable, working hard, and kissing may be desirable for some individuals, they are not universal desires in the context of the question. Falling in love, on the other hand, is a common desire for many people regardless of gender or cultural background."}

The option \"go to market\" suggests that the person is buying fish rather than catching it themselves. \"Rent a boat\" and \"reconsider\" do not make sense in the context of the question. \"Go fishing\" is too broad and does not provide any specific information about where to go fishing. Therefore, the most appropriate option is \"go deep sea fishing,\" which suggests that the person caught the fish in the ocean rather than a river or lake."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "694fc37d852dfa59079a0e478731bda4", "question": {"question_concept": "central passage", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "access rooms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "arena"}, {"label": "C", "text": "public building"}, {"label": "D", "text": "access carrers"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tomb"}], "stem": "It was tradition for the team to enter what through the central passage?"}}, "k": "arena\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the team is participating in some sort of event or competition, and entering through a central passage. The word \"arena\" is commonly associated with events such as sports, concerts, or performances, which fits with the idea of a team entering through a central passage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "df8074eb928c4c0f1c0d2765cd17ef11", "question": {"question_concept": "loving another", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "wonderful"}, {"label": "B", "text": "enjoyment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "jealousy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "satisfaction"}, {"label": "E", "text": "happiness"}], "stem": "Joe wants to have a relationship with someone.  He thinks that loving another will bring him what?"}}, "k": "happiness\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe believes that loving someone will bring him a positive emotion. The options \"wonderful,\" \"enjoyment,\" and \"satisfaction\" also connote positive emotions, but \"happiness\" is the most general term and could encompass all of these emotions. \"Jealousy\" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it is a negative emotion and not typically associated with romantic relationships."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "42776afd95363e0133a0c7cdb4271656", "question": {"question_concept": "typing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "letter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "carpal tunnel syndrome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a triple felony"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "indeterminate"}], "stem": "What could be a serious consequence of typing too much?"}}, "k": "carpal tunnel syndrome\nKnowledge: Typing too much is known to cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a painful condition that affects the wrists, hands, and fingers. This is commonly seen in people who work on computers for long hours and type excessively. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options are less likely to have a crowded motorway - Europe is a continent, England is a country, a garage is a small space used for car repairs, and New Jersey is a state known for its highways but not necessarily for having crowded motorways."}

It is the body's way of regulating temperature and cooling down. Breath problems, exhaustion, shortness of breath, and shin splints may also be experienced during and after jogging, but they are not directly related to the question of what the body will be doing."}

She can't talk because she is unable to do what?"}}, "k": "make sound\nKnowledge: The sentence states that Sally can't talk, which implies that her throat injury is affecting her ability to produce sound. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide a plausible explanation for why Sally can't speak."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "30f3586ff821867a85b75ed7b9abd732", "question": {"question_concept": "analysing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "bad code"}, {"label": "B", "text": "change"}, {"label": "C", "text": "better knowledge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "headache"}, {"label": "E", "text": "learning more about"}], "stem": "What could stop you fron analysing?"}}, "k": "headache\nKnowledge: The other options all suggest possible ways to improve or continue the analysis, while a headache is an external factor that could prevent someone from analyzing. The sentence implies that the person is unable to analyze because they have a headache, which is a physical symptom that can make it difficult to concentrate or focus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "37db8c07ec5e5338b736e7e50bd6b6fd", "question": {"question_concept": "fabric", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "curtains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "tailor shop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "clothing store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sewing room"}, {"label": "E", "text": "hardware store"}], "stem": "Fabric is cut to order at what type of seller?"}}, "k": "tailor shop\nKnowledge: The phrase \"cut to order\" suggests that the fabric is being cut specifically for a customer's needs. This is a service typically offered at shops that specialize in custom clothing, such as tailor shops. Curtain stores may offer pre-cut lengths of fabric, but they are usually not cut to order. Clothing stores may offer some customization options, but they typically do not cut fabric on-site. Sewing rooms may offer this service, but it is not a commonly used term. Hardware stores do not typically sell fabric or offer cutting services."}

It is unlikely to be found in a utility closet, cupboard, or broom closet as these spaces are not typically used for waste collection. While some kitchens may have a trash can, the term \"dustbin\" is more commonly used in outdoor or public settings where waste is collected on the ground."}

The option \"bookcase\" does not fit this context as it is typically used for storing books, not food. \"Displaying framed photos\" is also not a likely answer as shelves used for displaying framed photos are typically found in homes, not public spaces where people shop for food. \"Gas station\" may have some food items for sale, but it is not the main purpose of a gas station. \"Chest of drawers\" is also not a likely answer as it is typically used for storing clothes or other personal items. Thus, \"grocery store\" is the most appropriate answer."}

Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk but does not contribute directly to bone development. Water is a liquid that does not contain any significant nutrients. Metal is a broad category that does not relate to this specific question. Fridge is an appliance and is not relevant to the question."}

Additionally, the person has a long commute, which implies that they live further away from their workplace. Of the options given, \"office park\" is the most closely related to the context of the sentence as it suggests a collection of buildings that are primarily used as office spaces. The other options, such as \"motel\" or \"lunch restaurant,\" are not particularly relevant to the context of the sentence."}

It is important to take proper precautions to prevent injuries, such as warming up before playing and wearing appropriate protective gear. Competition and losing may be part of the game, and hitting the ball and having fun are usually encouraged."}

It could be available in coffee shops, grocery stores, or even in people's homes. Therefore, it is important to consider the context before making an assumption on where sugar may be found."}

Of the five options, public place is the most general and includes places like shopping centers, office buildings, airports, and hospitals, all of which are common locations for revolving doors. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence."}

Being alive means that the person or organism is not dead and is currently functioning, which is opposite to being lifeless. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Dog shows are a popular type of competition where dogs are judged based on their adherence to breed standards, obedience, and other factors. Other options such as basket, triathlon, animal shelter, and own home are not likely to be relevant to a competition involving a small dog."}

As a result, it is likely that a music shop would carry tuning forks. The other options, such as a hardware store or science lab, would not have any reason to stock tuning forks."}

It is unlikely that he would be playing in a chicken coop or a used car lot, and being dead doesn't make sense in this context. The location of Washington D.C. also doesn't seem to have any relevance to the sentence."}

Additionally, the mention of a teakettle suggests that the speaker may have visited a tea room or been exposed to English tea culture, which is well-known for its emphasis on afternoon tea and tea-drinking traditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to England or teakettles."}

He did it for what?"}}, "k": "relaxation\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam enjoyed getting drunk for a particular reason. The context clues within the sentence imply that he is seeking something positive, indicating that he likely drinks for relaxation rather than negative outcomes like nausea, vomiting, or fighting. Additionally, alcohol is a common substance used for relaxation purposes."}

The options \"supermarket,\" \"grocery store,\" and \"vending machine\" are less likely to carry specialized infant products like feeding bottles. \"Liquor store\" is completely unrelated to the context of the question. \"Nursery,\" on the other hand, is a place where infant products like feeding bottles are commonly found."}

The other options are not typically associated with hanging artwork. A desktop or table may be used to display small pieces of art, but the verb \"hang\" implies a larger piece on a wall. Newspaper and ceiling are not appropriate places to hang a picture."}

The other options do not align with the context of the sentence."}

In the context of a school setting, it is likely that he was encouraging them to do their best academically. The phrase \"try hard\" also reinforces the idea of putting effort into schoolwork or studying. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence; wearing shoes and playing computer games, for example, are not things that the principal would likely be discussing in this context."}

In addition, the phrase \"risky investor\" indicates that the individual may be comfortable with volatile or high-risk investments, which are typically chosen with the aim of generating higher returns. The other choices - back project, lose money, sell stock, and save money - are unlikely to be goals of a younger, risky investor."}

Therefore, they may be looking for service that is in the middle or just \"good enough.\" The word \"adequate\" implies that something is enough or satisfactory, but not necessarily exceptional. The other options all suggest some level of high quality or speed, which goes against what the person is looking for in this scenario."}

He would have to be on drugs for the rest of his life, but they allowed it to be what?"}}, "k": "managed\nKnowledge: The sentence states that John was in good hands despite suffering from mental illness and that he would have to be on drugs for the rest of his life. This suggests that his condition is manageable but not curable. The option \"effectively treated\" contradicts this because John's condition is not curable, while \"managed\" aligns with the idea that John will need ongoing drug therapy to manage his condition. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

This is because towns typically have smaller populations and less space for large buildings compared to large cities or universities. \"Underground\" is not a likely answer because buildings found underground are often large and sprawling, such as subway stations or malls. \"Ant town\" is not a real location and has no relevant context to the question."}

Therefore, they would need to have access to a source of these materials in order to build their dams. A wooded area would be the most likely place for a beaver to find the necessary materials. The other options, such as a zoo, body of water, or Home Depot, do not provide the natural materials that a beaver would need to construct a dam. Books are obviously not a source of physical materials."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "6f906b3872bbc2ed654c2108956a9d22", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sleep"}, {"label": "B", "text": "care about"}, {"label": "C", "text": "spare time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "know everything"}, {"label": "E", "text": "own house"}], "stem": "A person who works 14 hours a day will have very little what?"}}, "k": "spare time\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who works 14 hours a day will have very little of something, which indicates that it is a resource that is limited or scarce. The options \"sleep\" and \"care about\" could be logically connected to working long hours, but the sentence specifically mentions \"very little,\" which rules out those options since they are absolute quantities. \"Know everything\" is not directly related to the context of the sentence and is not a logical consequence of working long hours. \"Own house\" is also not a logical consequence of working long hours and is not directly related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, \"spare time\" is the correct answer since it is a resource that is likely to be scarce for someone who works long hours."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "4a0736f6e71c58b083d8d5fe53f1d4d3", "question": {"question_concept": "play piano", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "learn how"}, {"label": "B", "text": "learn music"}, {"label": "C", "text": "make music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "take lessons"}, {"label": "E", "text": "practice"}], "stem": "The teacher explained why he should play piano even though he wanted to play guitar, she said it was the best introduction to what?"}}, "k": "learn music\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the teacher recommended playing piano as a way to introduce the student to something related to music. Learning an instrument is often associated with learning music theory and developing an understanding of musical structure, which may explain why the teacher suggested playing piano as a starting point. The other options do not have a clear connection to the sentence, as they either describe a process of learning or practicing an instrument, rather than a broader introduction to music."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "4632121910a2ddcf487aa9a7fb60f8dc", "question": {"question_concept": "stone", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "gallbladder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "creek bed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "driveway"}, {"label": "D", "text": "river bed"}, {"label": "E", "text": "gravel"}], "stem": "It turned out it wasn't a kidney stone, what might it have been a stone in?"}}, "k": "gallbladder\nKnowledge: The phrase \"it turned out it wasn't a kidney stone\" implies that the object in question was found in a different part of the body. The most likely choice from the given answer options is the gallbladder, as it can also produce stones. The other options, such as creek bed, driveway, river bed, and gravel, are not related to bodily organs and do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "5c34a4a5145b03dd19728ef40b3ee8df", "question": {"question_concept": "grape", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "lunch box"}, {"label": "B", "text": "food store"}, {"label": "C", "text": "wine country"}, {"label": "D", "text": "kitchen"}, {"label": "E", "text": "raisins"}], "stem": "Where are small grapes likely to be found?"}}, "k": "wine country\nKnowledge: Grapes are the primary source of wine, and wine grapes tend to be smaller than table grapes. Wine country refers to regions where grapes are grown for the purpose of making wine, so it is the most likely answer. The other options (lunch box, food store, kitchen, raisins) are not associated with grapes that are specifically small."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "672ae58d76d3f6e747f91c18cb1d4ce0", "question": {"question_concept": "boredom", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "take a nap because you're broke"}, {"label": "B", "text": "do crossword puzzle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "grocery shop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "see art"}, {"label": "E", "text": "play games"}], "stem": "If I am suffering from boredom, and I am also hungry, what should I do?"}}, "k": "grocery shop\nKnowledge: Since the sentence mentions hunger and boredom, the best option would be grocery shopping as it would help to alleviate hunger while also providing an opportunity for stimulation through selecting and preparing food. The other options do not address the specific needs mentioned in the sentence. Taking a nap may provide temporary relief from boredom, but it won't address hunger. Doing a crossword puzzle or seeing art may help with boredom but won't address hunger. Playing games may provide entertainment but again won't address the issue of hunger."}

Furthermore, the fact that she had a \"vision\" implies that she was in a state of altered consciousness or dreaming, so the correct answer is likely \"falling asleep.\" The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

A common feature that one might encounter when driving toward a river is a valley. A valley is a low area of land between hills or mountains, often with a river or stream flowing through it. Therefore, the correct answer is valley, while the other options do not make sense in the given context."}

People often strive to own their own home as it provides stability, security, and a place to raise a family. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or the goals of adults with families."}

Owning things is often seen as a sign of wealth, as people who have more money are able to purchase expensive items such as cars, homes, and luxury goods. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This traumatic experience can cause dogs to become fearful of humans and not trust them, even if they are treated kindly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Going for a run may actually tire a person out more, while watering plants and catching a cold are not relevant to the question. Lying in bed is also an option, but it may not necessarily lead to feeling refreshed unless the person is actually resting and relaxing."}

Chemistry labs, parties, and supermarkets do not typically sell alcohol, and restaurants may sell alcohol but do not typically advertise themselves as a place to buy alcohol without also providing a meal. Therefore, the correct answer is likely a pub."}

The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be locations where a captured bird would spend the rest of its life."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "581b63cb3c29335946cbe561f5bea86f", "question": {"question_concept": "knob", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "doorway"}, {"label": "B", "text": "control panel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "television"}, {"label": "D", "text": "drawer"}, {"label": "E", "text": "opening doors"}], "stem": "Dan didn't like what he was seeing, so he turned the control know and flipped it to Andy.  What is the knob on?"}}, "k": "control panel\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan turned a knob to transfer control to Andy, which is a common feature found in control panels. Control panels are used to operate various systems such as sound and lighting systems, machinery, and electronic devices. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Where might he try looking for  it?"}}, "k": "bedstand\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe keeps his comb near a mirror, which is often found on a bedstand or a vanity table. The other options are less likely because a medicine cabinet is typically in a bathroom, a suitcase is for traveling, a barber shop is a public place, and a pocket is a personal item that Joe would have with him."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "4c301fbb8a56ced578cecab63d779e1e", "question": {"question_concept": "thoroughfare", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "city"}, {"label": "B", "text": "traffic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "town"}, {"label": "D", "text": "skyscrapper"}, {"label": "E", "text": "country"}], "stem": "The thoroughfare ran though a place full of skyscrapers.  Where did it run through?"}}, "k": "city\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions skyscrapers, which are tall buildings commonly found in urban areas or cities. A thoroughfare is also a term used to describe a main road or street in a city. The other options, such as traffic or country, do not accurately describe the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "39ea9c1e6fa6123df50b7f690c6a748b", "question": {"question_concept": "returning to work", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "malaise"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sad"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stress"}, {"label": "D", "text": "painless"}, {"label": "E", "text": "boredom"}], "stem": "Bill is returning to work.   He has experienced a bad feeling and thus stayed home for a week.  What did he probably feel?"}}, "k": "malaise\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Bill had a negative feeling that caused him to stay home from work for a week. The word \"malaise\" specifically refers to a general feeling of discomfort or unease, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options (sad, stress, painless, boredom) do not necessarily imply an illness or physical discomfort, which is suggested by the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "9fa45963035f38bfc0f14e86b1f32718", "question": {"question_concept": "deep", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "light"}, {"label": "B", "text": "shallow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "shallow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "high"}, {"label": "E", "text": "frivolous"}], "stem": "The deep ocean is dark, and diving into it is both dangerous and what?"}}, "k": "dangerous\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that diving into the deep ocean is both dark and dangerous. The word \"dangerous\" is a clear contrast to the other options, which do not make sense in the context of the sentence. \"Light\" would not apply to the deep ocean, and \"shallow\" and \"frivolous\" suggest a lack of seriousness, which is not appropriate for the dangerous activity of deep-sea diving."}

However, in context, the sentence suggests that the speaker made a mistake while playing a different game where \"king me\" is not a common phrase. The other options (scrabble, deck of cards, castle) do not involve moves or phrases that are similar to \"king me,\" leaving chess game as the most likely option. In chess, the phrase \"check\" and \"checkmate\" are commonly used, and the term \"king\" is relevant because it is one of the pieces on the board."}

The most logical option in this case would be the human face, as that is a common subject in art where the lips would be a distinguishable feature. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

In the context of the question, it is asking where a bureau might be \"in charge,\" which suggests a position of authority or leadership. The French government would fit this description, as it is a centralized government with many bureaus and departments that oversee various areas of policy and administration. The other options do not necessarily imply a position of authority or leadership."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "2b6b48264b03b6418bfb8bc8c952a5cb", "question": {"question_concept": "lose weight", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "skinny"}, {"label": "B", "text": "feel better"}, {"label": "C", "text": "under weight"}, {"label": "D", "text": "lift weights"}, {"label": "E", "text": "healthy"}], "stem": "She felt the need to continue to lose weight, this was despite her already being what?"}}, "k": "skinny\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person is already on the thinner side but still feels the need to lose more weight. \"Skinny\" is the only option that directly relates to being thin or having a low body weight. \"Feel better,\" \"lift weights,\" and \"healthy\" do not necessarily indicate anything about the person's weight status. \"Under weight\" could be a possibility, but \"skinny\" is a more commonly used term in everyday language."}

The options \"wild,\" \"North Dakota,\" and \"forest\" are all locations where mammoths may have once lived. The option \"movie\" is irrelevant to the question. The only option that definitively would not have had mammoths is a zoo, as they have been extinct for thousands of years and are not currently kept in captivity."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "360e2554288fa49595a12f64b13678d0", "question": {"question_concept": "food", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "friend's house"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bicycle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "space shuttle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "kitchen"}, {"label": "E", "text": "disneyland"}], "stem": "Food on what kind of transport is normally freeze dried or dehydrated?"}}, "k": "space shuttle\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that the food is freeze-dried or dehydrated, which suggests that it is being prepared in a way that preserves it for a long time without refrigeration. This is important for space travel, where fresh food is not always available and there are limited options for storage. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the need for food preservation."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "094ea0c02e961d8542783a619c4e7ab1", "question": {"question_concept": "food", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "container"}, {"label": "B", "text": "kitchen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "backpack"}, {"label": "D", "text": "jar"}, {"label": "E", "text": "bowl"}], "stem": "Something that holds food or other items is called what?"}}, "k": "container\nKnowledge: The definition of a container is an object used to hold or transport something. The other options, such as kitchen, backpack, jar, and bowl, may have the capability to hold items but are not specifically designed for that purpose."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "611ee61036915ceaf60ea81a5d0acb02", "question": {"question_concept": "adult", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "drink beer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "put on make up"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dress himself"}, {"label": "D", "text": "work"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dress herself"}], "stem": "What would an adult woman do to get ready for work?"}}, "k": "dress herself\nKnowledge: The question is asking about a typical behavior or action of an adult woman when getting ready for work. Based on societal norms and expectations, it is most likely that a woman would dress herself and put on make-up. Drinking beer or dressing himself would be uncommon behaviors for an adult woman in this context. \"Work\" is a possible choice, but it is too general and does not specify the action of getting ready for work."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "d822ec93ff657781409bd789d3b341d4", "question": {"question_concept": "strip mall", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "suburbs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "city"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the desert"}, {"label": "D", "text": "vacant stores"}, {"label": "E", "text": "suburban town"}], "stem": "James wanted to build a new strip mall, but he wanted a lot of traffic.  He decided to build it in a high density residential area.  Where might he build it?"}}, "k": "city\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James wants a lot of traffic, which is more likely to be found in high-density urban areas such as cities. Suburbs and suburban towns may have less traffic, while the desert and vacant stores are not likely to have any traffic at all."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "a1bad13c86aca08528bc8803da576df1", "question": {"question_concept": "lover", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "distance themselves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fall in love"}, {"label": "C", "text": "make love"}, {"label": "D", "text": "loving more"}, {"label": "E", "text": "touching tenderly"}], "stem": "How might someone stop being a lover?"}}, "k": "distance themselves\nKnowledge: The use of the word \"stop\" implies that the question is asking how someone can end their status as a lover, rather than how they can improve their skills as a lover. \"Distance themselves\" is the most logical choice, as creating distance between oneself and a romantic partner is a common way to end a relationship. The other options do not address the question of how to stop being a lover, and some of them could actually deepen a person's feelings of love."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "a96d00d15b288418e623fd89b7ac791a", "question": {"question_concept": "hair dryer", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "jungle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "drug store"}, {"label": "C", "text": "box"}, {"label": "D", "text": "beauty salon"}, {"label": "E", "text": "bathroom"}], "stem": "She always wondered how safe it was to use her hair dryer straight after a hot shower, it was always so wet and steamy in the what?"}}, "k": "bathroom\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is considering the safety implications of using a hair dryer in an environment that is wet and steamy. The most likely place for this to occur is in a bathroom after taking a hot shower. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "cb099972be8be929d884c089195fc249", "question": {"question_concept": "shoe", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "house"}, {"label": "B", "text": "left foot"}, {"label": "C", "text": "wedding"}, {"label": "D", "text": "socks"}, {"label": "E", "text": "closet"}], "stem": "What does someone likely need after finding the right shoe?"}}, "k": "socks\nKnowledge: The question suggests that finding the right shoe is not enough on its own, and that something else is needed. One common accessory to wear with shoes is socks, which provide comfort and hygiene. The other options do not have any clear connection to shoes or finding the right fit."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "dacf952db6351a84857f7d909651e200", "question": {"question_concept": "shareholder", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "large company"}, {"label": "B", "text": "building"}, {"label": "C", "text": "den"}, {"label": "D", "text": "financial trouble"}, {"label": "E", "text": "factory"}], "stem": "Shareholders gather in what to have meetings?"}}, "k": "building\nKnowledge: Shareholders typically gather in a building for meetings, such as a corporate headquarters or a designated meeting venue. A den is too small for a large group of shareholders and financial trouble or a factory are not relevant to the context of the question. A large company may have a building for meetings, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "4fcc7ca7d4cb14d24950fc42d7d0c4b5", "question": {"question_concept": "learn", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "empowering"}, {"label": "B", "text": "improved performance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "increase knowledge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "intelligent"}, {"label": "E", "text": "have more knowledge"}], "stem": "WHy do people learn?"}}, "k": "increase knowledge\nKnowledge: This answer is supported by the common belief that one of the primary reasons people learn is to acquire new knowledge. The other answer choices may be additional benefits or outcomes of learning, but they do not fully capture the fundamental reason why people engage in learning activities. Empowering, improved performance, and becoming more intelligent are all positive results of learning, but they are not the primary motivation behind it. Additionally, \"have more knowledge\" is similar to the correct answer, but is not quite as specific."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "c93e44db24d57150cebcc60571414058", "question": {"question_concept": "visiting museum", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "enjoyment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "inspiration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "boredom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "being bored"}, {"label": "E", "text": "lethargy"}], "stem": "Bob is a very creative person.  Visiting the museum gave him a lot of what?"}}, "k": "inspiration\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob's visit to the museum had a positive impact on him, namely that it gave him something that he did not have before. Since the sentence describes Bob as a creative person, it is likely that the \"something\" he gained from the museum was related to his creativity. The context of the sentence suggests that Bob was inspired by the exhibits at the museum, which would lead to greater creativity. The other options, such as boredom and lethargy, have a negative connotation and do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "9fd82d9b4afc58cc737ffcb276cafed0", "question": {"question_concept": "nightclub", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "manhattan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "downtown area"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beside a river"}, {"label": "D", "text": "building"}, {"label": "E", "text": "major city"}], "stem": "Where is a nightclub likely to be?"}}, "k": "downtown area or major city\nKnowledge: Nightclubs are typically found in urban areas with a high population density where people go out at night to socialize and have fun. Major cities like New York and Los Angeles are known for having a vibrant nightlife scene, especially in the downtown areas where there are numerous bars and clubs in close proximity. While it is possible for a nightclub to be located beside a river or in a building, these options are less likely based on their general characteristics and the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "5a0caff3edf55778cfd9d4a8457f0fdd", "question": {"question_concept": "blowfish", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rock band"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sea of japan"}, {"label": "C", "text": "atlantic ocean"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fish market"}, {"label": "E", "text": "seafood"}], "stem": "The Blowfish make music for their lead, they are a what?"}}, "k": "rock band\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a group called The Blowfish who create music specifically for their lead singer. The term \"blowfish\" is not directly related to any of the other choices, which eliminates them as potential answers. Additionally, \"rock band\" is the best choice because it matches the context of the sentence and is a term commonly used to describe musical groups that play rock music."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "39b23069e9fbb800803f304d3b940d8a", "question": {"question_concept": "walking dog", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "picking up after dog"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sore feet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sick"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pride"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tiredness"}], "stem": "When spending a long time walking a dog what would you feel?"}}, "k": "tiredness\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that spending a long time walking a dog may result in a feeling, which is likely to be related to physical exhaustion or fatigue. The option \"picking up after dog\" is not a feeling but an action that may be associated with walking a dog. \"Sore feet\" is a possibility, but tiredness is the most common outcome of physical activity. \"Sick\" and \"pride\" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "25b57a8e633bfc1c0598be57798736a4", "question": {"question_concept": "fountain", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "grant park chicago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "public place"}, {"label": "C", "text": "waterfall"}, {"label": "D", "text": "rome"}, {"label": "E", "text": "courtyard"}], "stem": "Where is the trevi fountain?"}}, "k": "Rome\nKnowledge: The Trevi Fountain is a well-known landmark in Rome, Italy. The other answer choices do not have any connection to the location of the fountain."}

Getting higher and vertigo may be temporary sensations that occur during the climb, but they do not relate to the sense you feel afterward. Exhaustion may be a result of climbing, but it does not express the feeling you gain after completing the climb. Fear of heights is the opposite of what you would feel after successfully completing a climb. Accomplishment makes sense as it implies a positive feeling of achievement after overcoming a challenge."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "44b4b92e843af970497a1b4a2c9d62d1", "question": {"question_concept": "sword", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "salon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "stone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "collection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "museum"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sheath"}], "stem": "What would you do with a sword you are holding if you do not need to use it?"}}, "k": "sheath\nKnowledge: A sheath is a protective cover for a sword, typically made of leather or other durable material. If someone is holding a sword but doesn't need to use it, the logical action would be to sheath it to prevent any accidental harm or damage to the sword. The other options, such as salon or collection, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

She had to work late.  What might have caused her to work late?"}}, "k": "patient\nKnowledge: The sentence provides the context that Sally worked at a dentist office and had to work late. It's likely that she had to work late to attend to a patient who needed extra care or had an unexpected complication. The other options, such as the office building, town, office desk or Michigan, do not provide any relevant information that would explain why Sally had to work late."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "a7f1ef4065eec25339711e3ba2c194ed", "question": {"question_concept": "studying", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "new perspective"}, {"label": "B", "text": "increasing knowledge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "understanding"}, {"label": "D", "text": "more intelligence"}, {"label": "E", "text": "inspiration"}], "stem": "He didn't understand the subject at first, but after studying it for a while, what did he gain?"}}, "k": "understanding\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not initially comprehend the subject, but gained something after studying it for a while. \"Understanding\" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence structure and the meaning of the word. \"New perspective\" could also be a possible answer, but it is not as specific and does not directly state that the person gained comprehension. \"Increasing knowledge,\" \"more intelligence,\" and \"inspiration\" do not fit as well since they do not specifically describe the person's change in comprehension."}

They are also commonly found near bodies of water such as lakes or rivers, where they hunt for fish. The other options, such as France or toy stores, do not have any clear connection to the natural habitat of bald eagles. A nature reserve, on the other hand, would be a suitable environment for bald eagles to live in as it provides a protected and natural habitat for various species to thrive."}

Out of the choices given, only the Capitol building is commonly associated with the U.S. government and Congress. The other options are either too broad (country) or not located in the right city (Florida) to be correct. Democracies are forms of government, but the sentence is asking for the name of a building. Washington D.C. is the location of the Capitol building, but it is not the name of the building itself."}

In many cultures, shaking hands is a customary way of ending a meeting or agreeing on something, so it is the most likely choice. The other options, such as feeling good or appreciating each other, do not necessarily involve a physical action that would seal a deal. Kissing or smiling may be inappropriate in professional or formal settings."}

Therefore, the likely status of a clock that is ticking is that it is working correctly. The other options all suggest some sort of malfunction or failure, but the phrase \"ticking\" implies regular working order."}

For example, sunflowers, daffodils, and marigolds are all well-known flowers that are typically yellow. While the other choices in this question may be related to flowers in some way (such as fragrant flowers or different types of flowering plants), only yellow is directly associated with the color of flowers."}

A theatre, show, concert hall, or opera would not be typical locations for a graduation ceremony. The word \"stage\" in the question also supports the idea that the event is taking place in an auditorium, as auditoriums usually have a raised platform area for performances or events."}

Where might she have bought the dog?"}}, "k": "person's house\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane was driving back home from Mexico to Toronto when she bought the dog, indicating the location where the dog was bought was likely somewhere along the way. The option \"person's house\" is the most likely answer as it suggests that Jane may have purchased the dog from an individual she met on her trip. The other options do not provide any context or relevance to the sentence."}

A reward is a common way to show appreciation for someone's help, especially when it involves returning lost items. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this scenario."}

Out of the options provided, only \"movement\" could indicate that the child was still on the move. \"Arriving\" suggests that the child had already reached the destination, \"driving\" is a method of transportation rather than an indication of progress, \"excitement\" could be a result of arriving at the destination or undergoing a change in plans, and \"expense\" has no relevance to the context. Therefore, \"movement\" is the correct answer."}

Networking and connecting are features of computers that allow them to communicate with other devices but doesn't convey the idea of what computers are primarily designed to do. Costing money is also not a characteristic unique to computers, as all products have a price. Teaching is not related to the context of the sentence, as computers might be used as a tool for teaching, but it is not their primary function."}

A drawer is a common storage solution for small items like stamps, coins, and other collectibles. The other options are not as suitable for storing small items or may not be easily accessible for frequent use."}

Fraternity houses are often associated with this type of environment, as they are typically places where young men socialize, drink, and engage in activities related to college life. The other options, such as beer or wine, are simply types of alcohol and do not provide any contextual clues to support them as the correct answer. The restaurant and pub options do not provide any contextual clues related to excessive alcohol or testosterone."}

The most logical option would be a restaurant, as they commonly serve alcohol with meals and have the necessary equipment to prepare and serve steak. The other options do not make sense in this context, as a chemistry lab, manual, and supermarket are not places where one would typically consume alcohol, and it is generally not allowed to drink alcohol in a pub while handling sharp objects."}

The word \"enlightenment\" implies that gaining knowledge about the world leads to a deeper understanding and awareness, which is often associated with enlightenment. The other options (confusion, sadness, pleasure, and world views) do not necessarily align with the idea of gaining knowledge about the world."}

The most common reason for displacement of indigenous peoples by settlers is the desire for land, which is often tied to ideas of property ownership. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be \"own land\", as the aboriginal people may not have had a formal system of property ownership that was recognized by the settlers. The other options do not have a clear link to the context of the sentence."}

This \"something\" is likely to be an answer or a solution to their questions. Dedication and confidence may be important in the process of finding answers, but they are not the specific thing that a person needs to figure out. Surprised and compliments are not at all related to finding answers to questions."}

The phrase \"not a single drop of blood\" indicates that the context of the sentence is referring to a situation where violence was expected or anticipated. The options \"vein,\" \"person,\" \"paper,\" and \"clinic\" do not fit the context and are not related to conflict or violence."}

Among the choices, \"have rest\" is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the person's need to relax and recharge. \"Sleep\" is also a good option, but it is more time-consuming than simply having a rest. \"Sit on chair\" and \"stand up\" do not necessarily provide relief from fatigue, while \"sit down\" is redundant as it doesn't provide any new information."}

It was a silly film, but exciting.  It gave her a great deal of what?"}}, "k": "enjoyment\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that May found the film exciting and enjoyable, despite it being silly. The word \"exciting\" also adds to this idea of enjoyment. The other options like relaxation and sadness do not match the context of the sentence, while the option of \"stupidity\" seems inappropriate as a result of the positive language used to describe the film. The option of \"masturbation\" is also unrelated to the context of the sentence."}

He wanted her to be what?"}}, "k": "happy\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James attended Sarah's birthday party despite experiencing a recent loss, likely his father's death. The fact that he still went to the party implies that he wanted to help Sarah celebrate and be happy on her special day. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as applauding or going online, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Taking notes is also mentioned, but it is not necessarily the person's favorite way of participating in lectures. The most logical answer based on the context is that the person enjoyed attending lectures because it was their favorite way of learning."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "1596bb54bdd46075d8a9dc372559a369", "question": {"question_concept": "waging war", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "defeat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "suffering"}, {"label": "C", "text": "people dying"}, {"label": "D", "text": "evil"}, {"label": "E", "text": "confusion"}], "stem": "What usually happens to citizens when there is waging war?"}}, "k": "suffering\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that war has negative effects on citizens. The other options are also negative, but specifically refer to the outcome or nature of the war rather than its impact on citizens. \"Suffering\" is a more neutral term that encompasses a range of negative experiences that citizens may undergo during war, such as displacement, loss of loved ones, and psychological trauma."}

What did he have?"}}, "k": "not hungry\nKnowledge: The sentence clearly states that James \"couldn't stand the idea of having food,\" indicating that he had no appetite. The other options suggest physical discomfort or issues with digestion, which are not mentioned in the sentence."}

The most logical answer is \"learning,\" as the purpose of a museum is typically to educate visitors about history, culture, art, or other topics. The other options, such as \"angry\" or \"pleasure,\" do not fit the context and are unlikely outcomes of visiting a museum. \"Archeology\" is a related topic but not specifically mentioned in the sentence as a direct outcome of visiting a museum."}

It is not typically motivated by punishment or a desire to go to jail. The word \"frolicking\" seems out of place and does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. \"Investigation\" is a process involved in solving a crime, but is not a motive for committing one."}

Feeling pain is a common response that indicates an injury, while procreation, asexually reproducing, and biting are not necessarily connected to the question at hand. A distress call, on the other hand, may also be a sign of injury, but the emphasis on feeling pain in the sentence suggests that it is the best answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "fc4066585596e3834dda60c17db183ed", "question": {"question_concept": "buying beer", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "get arrested"}, {"label": "B", "text": "relaxation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "losing money"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pleasure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "buzzed"}], "stem": "If you've had a difficult work day what are you hoping to gain when buying beer?"}}, "k": "relaxation\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is buying beer as a way to cope with a difficult workday. The most common reason for consuming alcohol after a stressful day is to relax and unwind. The other options (get arrested, losing money, pleasure, buzzed) do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely reasons for buying beer after a difficult workday."}

The phrase \"getting ready to work\" implies a preparatory action rather than an actual duty, which rules out options like \"pull someone over\" or \"force law\". Similarly, the phrase does not imply any aggressive action like \"arming themselves,\" but rather a more helpful, community-oriented task like \"helping people\". \"Directing traffic\" is a possible option, but less likely as it is a more specific task and not necessarily related to police work as a whole."}

This means that they will go up into the air and eventually into the sky. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they are not relevant to the behavior of balloons when released."}

The sentence further suggests that the person has limited access to the outside world and that the newspaper is their only source of information or entertainment. The other options (floor, front door, reporter, porch) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This is a commonly documented phenomenon where the breakdown of asparagus produces sulfur-containing compounds that give urine a distinct and often unpleasant smell. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. \"Gain weight\" suggests that the person is inactive or eating too much, which is not necessarily related to their job. \"Walk away\" and \"turn around\" suggest that the person is leaving their job, which is the opposite of what the sentence implies. \"Getting a burnout\" is a possibility, but not a definitive answer."}

The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence; a house or school entrance hall would be unlikely to have royalty in it, and a person or the outside do not fit with the description of a grandiose entrance hall."}

The phrase \"have patience\" is often used as a synonym for waiting or enduring hardship without becoming angry or frustrated. The other options do not properly convey the meaning of waiting or suggest impatience. \"Stay in one place\" is a similar phrase but does not necessarily imply waiting or delay. \"To waist time\" is a misspelling of \"waste time\" and suggests a negative connotation of waiting, rather than a patient one. \"1000nd\" is not a word and has no association with waiting or patience."}

The other options, such as \"use the bathroom\" or \"like dancing\", do not fit the context of the sentence as well as \"express yourself\" does."}

The most likely location for a book that is being read by one person is their bedside table, as this is a common place for people to keep books they are currently reading. The other options, such as a school room or discount store, do not make sense in this context."}

The option \"buy prepared foods\" is similar but not specific enough, while \"buy food\" is too broad and could include any type of store or restaurant. \"Large city\" and \"Michigan\" are irrelevant to the context and do not provide any clues to help choose the correct answer."}

The options \"mole den,\" \"used car lot,\" \"viking ship,\" and \"chicken coop\" do not make sense in this context. However, a \"rabbit warren\" is a collection of interconnected rabbit burrows, which can provide food and shelter for predators like weasels. Therefore, it is the most logical answer in this scenario."}

One of the men then stated that he thought she was \"too\" a certain characteristic, which implies that they were discussing the woman's physical appearance. The word \"thin\" is often used to describe a person who is not overweight or has a small body frame, which may be why the man thought she was \"too\" thin. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The word \"contempt\" means a feeling of disdain or dislike for someone or something, suggesting that the fighters held each other in a low regard because of things that were said. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not communicate a negative attitude that the fighters have towards each other."}

A table is a common place for a vase to be positioned, as it is a central location where it can be easily seen by customers. The other options, such as shelf, cabinet, windowsill, and bathroom, are less likely locations for a vase."}

The choice \"anger\" best fits this context as it is a common emotion associated with losing. The other choices - having fun, entertaining, enjoying, and injury - do not fit the context of the sentence."}

While a clock can technically be stored in any of the options listed, the most practical and likely choice would be a shelf. A shelf provides a stable flat surface for the clock to sit on, and it allows for easy access to the clock when needed. The other options may not provide the same level of stability or accessibility for the clock."}

The most logical place for him to find a new accordion would be a music store, as they specialize in selling musical instruments. The other options do not relate to the situation described in the sentence, and therefore, they can be eliminated."}

Relaxing is often associated with stress relief, as fresh air can provide a feeling of calmness and tranquility. Exhilaration and reviving are usually associated with intense physical activity, which may not be suitable for a stressed person. Feeling better and clear head are vague and could apply to a variety of situations, making them less likely to be the correct answer."}

Many people use a diary as a tool to keep track of important details in their life, such as appointments, thoughts or feelings, which they may want to reference later. Expressing oneself and recording thoughts are also common reasons for keeping a diary, but the specific wording of the question suggests that the primary purpose is to avoid forgetting important information. \"Have to say\" and \"move fingers\" are not commonly cited reasons for keeping a diary, and are not supported by the context of the question."}

A meadow is a natural open space filled with wildflowers and grass, which would be an ideal location for the bug to find what it was looking for without the possibility of human interruption. The other options (garden, bug zapper, rug, rock) do not have the natural setting suggested by the sentence, and some (bug zapper, rug) would actively repel the bug rather than attract it."}

The White House in Washington D.C. is an example of neoclassical architecture, while the Pantheon in Rome is a famous ancient Roman building with columns. Spreadsheets are not related to architecture and do not have any columns in the traditional sense."}

The other options such as office, bookstore, race track, and firehouse do not have a clear association with lending chairs, making them unlikely choices."}

The word \"everything\" in the choices is the only option that covers all of God's creations. The other options are not as comprehensive and do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "4f8f02a3a0bde53ce61ece044abf38bd", "question": {"question_concept": "hot", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "freezing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lifeless"}, {"label": "C", "text": "chilled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "neutral"}, {"label": "E", "text": "cold"}], "stem": "What is the opposite of hot?"}}, "k": "cold\nKnowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of hot, which implies a temperature scale. The other options are not typically used as antonyms for hot. Freezing and chilled are related to temperature and are colder than hot, while lifeless and neutral do not have a clear connection to temperature."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "8a50e72052dd92223f8989e8fb7d24ca", "question": {"question_concept": "monkey", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "treetops"}, {"label": "B", "text": "works"}, {"label": "C", "text": "disturb"}, {"label": "D", "text": "nigeria"}, {"label": "E", "text": "south american country"}], "stem": "A helper monkey does what around the home of a disabled person?"}}, "k": "works\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that a helper monkey is doing something useful or helpful around the home of a disabled person. The word \"works\" suggests that the monkey is performing some kind of task or job, such as fetching items or helping with daily activities. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - treetops and disturb are not related to the concept of a helper monkey, and the mention of Nigeria and South American countries is irrelevant to the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "d6a2e192da96dfb3fd951867e11df8b6", "question": {"question_concept": "diamonds", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "more expensive than sand"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rare"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pretty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "clear"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dessert"}], "stem": "The diamonds were difficult for the prospectors to find, but why is that?"}}, "k": "rare\nKnowledge: The sentence describes the diamonds as being difficult for the prospectors to find, which suggests that they were not commonly available. The word \"rare\" means something that is not easily found or limited in quantity, making it the most appropriate choice. The other options do not explain why the diamonds were hard to find and are therefore incorrect."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "b644cc35b1b10360d34e8ad086dad07c", "question": {"question_concept": "calm", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "medium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "excited"}, {"label": "C", "text": "agitated"}, {"label": "D", "text": "frantic"}, {"label": "E", "text": "frenzied"}], "stem": "The cat seemed calm around the stranger, but it was actually quite what and ready to claw?"}}, "k": "agitated\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat may have been giving a false impression of its behavior around the stranger, as it was actually ready to claw. The word \"calm\" is used as a contrast to the actual behavior of the cat, which suggests that it may have been masking its true feelings. The words \"excited,\" \"medium,\" and \"frantic\" do not capture the negative connotations associated with the word \"claw,\" whereas \"agitated\" and \"frenzied\" do. However, \"frenzied\" implies a higher level of intensity compared to \"agitated,\" making \"agitated\" the more appropriate answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "e9e041b2e0bf938615cc0a149680b7ae", "question": {"question_concept": "climbing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "getting higher"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fear of heights"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sore muscles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "get higher"}, {"label": "E", "text": "short rope"}], "stem": "What prevents someone from climbing?"}}, "k": "fear of heights\nKnowledge: The question implies that there is a psychological barrier preventing someone from climbing. Fear of heights is a common phobia that can cause physical symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and increased heart rate. \"Getting higher\" and \"get higher\" are redundant options and do not add any new information. \"Sore muscles\" implies physical discomfort but does not explain why someone would be unable to climb. \"Short rope\" is a technical limitation rather than a psychological one."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "dbc836050711904f5708b28a152ac4c4", "question": {"question_concept": "choker", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "boutique"}, {"label": "B", "text": "kennel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "jewelry box"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pet store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "jewelry store"}], "stem": "If you aren't in a jewelry store or looking in a jewelry box where might you find a choker?"}}, "k": "boutique\nKnowledge: The question is asking where you might find a choker if you are not in a jewelry store or looking in a jewelry box. A choker is a type of necklace that fits closely around the neck, and it is often worn as a fashion accessory. Boutiques typically sell a variety of trendy and fashionable clothing and accessories, including chokers. The other options, such as a kennel or a pet store, are not likely to have anything to do with chokers."}

Stores typically have a variety of products available, whereas vending machines usually only offer a limited selection. Health food stores may not carry soda at all, and liquid and picnic cooler are not typically places where one would buy a can of soda."}

While swimming or having a haircut may offer some relief from heat, they are not directly related to the craving mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, since \"eat ice cream\" is listed twice as a choice, it is likely the correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "641f2028eac8031f763afec7e5ba5abe", "question": {"question_concept": "scissors", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "counter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cabinet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "backpack"}, {"label": "E", "text": "desk"}], "stem": "Where in your room would you put scissors that you use all the time?"}}, "k": "desk\nKnowledge: The question suggests that the scissors are frequently used and therefore need to be easily accessible. The most common place to keep frequently used tools like scissors is on a desk or work surface where they can be easily reached. The other options do not provide a suitable location for easy access, as a cabinet or backpack requires extra effort to retrieve the scissors, a counter may not be a permanent work surface, and a house is not a specific location within a room."}

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as a comforter is not typically found in the living room, linen closet, at the cleaners, or in the washing machine."}

Options like country, camper, kitchen, and canned do not relate to meat specifically, but deli is a type of meat counter that often carries cold cuts like ham, turkey, and roast beef which are common sandwich fillings. Therefore, deli is the best option for the correct answer."}

The options \"have time for,\" \"prepare food,\" and \"eat food\" are not specific to the act of searching for a place to have lunch. \"Satiate their appetite\" is a possible answer, but it is less specific compared to \"find food.\""}

What is it?"}}, "k": "average\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that being beautiful in Hollywood is not unusual or remarkable, implying that it is a common occurrence or expectation. Therefore, the answer is likely to be a term that suggests something ordinary or typical, which would be \"average\". The other options are all negatively charged words that do not fit the context of the sentence."}

The most appropriate action in this situation would be for the solicitor to send a letter to the concerned parties, alerting them of the potential legal implications and to take appropriate measures to avoid the situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence; claiming compensation and charging according to time are actions that solicitors may take in response to a legal issue, while reporting to the government and buying a house do not have any relevance to the context."}

The phrase \"everybody has some sort of creativity\" implies that creativity is a universal trait that is not limited to specific skills or talents. While creating art, writing, and sewing are also ways to express oneself, the phrase \"best way to\" indicates that expressing oneself is the most effective or preferred way among the options provided."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - pleasure and feeling of guilt suggest emotional reactions, being imprisoned suggests a legal consequence, and cake has no relevance to the topic."}

The option \"see\" would make the most sense as one could observe the location or movement of the jellyfish from a distance. The other options, such as using one's hand or finding a jellyfish in a store or zoo, do not address the question being asked. The mention of the Mediterranean Sea may be a distractor as it is not relevant to the question."}

What is the long-term consequence of having too much food?"}}, "k": "weight gain\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that overeating has negative consequences, and one of the most commonly known consequences of overeating is weight gain. Eating more calories than the body needs can lead to excess fat storage and ultimately result in an increase in body weight. The other options, such as digesting, constipation, not hungry, and gas, may occur as short-term consequences but do not have a significant association with long-term effects of overeating."}

The most logical option would be \"meet,\" as it is commonly used in this context to refer to a planned meeting or appointment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either irrelevant (have fun, whittle) or unlikely given the serious nature of spying (die, arriving)."}

He slid into the outside lane.  Up ahead he would have to do what?"}}, "k": "turn right\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James is driving and has slid into the outside lane. The phrase \"up ahead\" implies that there is some change that James will have to make, and the options listed all involve a change of direction. However, the sentence does not provide any context to suggest that James needs to take a U-turn, turn left, crash, or get to town. The most logical option is for James to turn right, as this would be a natural transition from being in the outside lane."}

In such a situation, it is common for people to wonder about the details of what happened as they try to make sense of the chaos around them. The other choices do not make sense in this context. Crossing the street, running away, or washing themselves are unlikely to be the primary concerns in this scenario, and feeling lucky is not a logical response to witnessing an accident."}

Typically, turnpikes are located in more densely populated areas like urban regions where there is a greater need for transportation infrastructure. In contrast, rural areas such as the countryside are less likely to have turnpikes, as they typically have lower levels of traffic and are not as well-suited to collecting tolls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the meaning of the term \"turnpike\" in this context."}

None of the other choices clearly relate to the context of the sentence. \"Buying beer\" might suggest that the woman is still drinking, while \"alcoholism\" might suggest a deeper and ongoing issue with addiction. \"Aim\" and \"Michigan\" do not have any clear connections to the sentence."}

It involves moving the head up and down slightly, often accompanied by a smile or other facial expression of agreement. Handshakes are typically used as a form of greeting or agreement, but not specifically to show agreement. Kisses are often considered a romantic gesture and not commonly used to show agreement in most cultures. Lie and shaking hand are not appropriate responses as they are not positive ways of showing agreement."}

The other options do not reflect the consequences of over-indulgence in food."}

When consumed in large quantities, they can cause a person's breath to become quite pungent. Therefore, the most likely result of the guy's lunch would be bad breath, which is often considered an unpleasant side effect of eating foods with strong flavors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While schools and churches may have rules, they would not typically be the consequence for breaking the law.

The other options - to be fired, season with salt, better food, perfect food - do not accurately reflect the job description of a cook."}

This is closely related to the concept of communication, which involves a sender encoding a message and a receiver decoding it. The other options, such as opera, making sound, or dry mouth, do not relate to the primary purpose of talking. \"People to listen\" is close to the correct answer, but it is not as specific or accurate as \"attempting to communicate.\""}

Feeling good, pleasure, and being happy are all possible outcomes of kissing, but the term \"long\" suggests a more intense experience that may go beyond just feeling good. Bad breath is a negative consequence of poor oral hygiene and is not directly linked to long kissing."}

Sweat is the body's natural way of regulating temperature during exercise, and a lot of sweat can result in a significant loss of water weight. The other options (exercise, pass out, collapse, drink water) are either too generic or do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

A movie theater or theater district would not be selling tickets for an event happening outside, and a theatre may or may not be selling tickets for an outdoor event. Street is also not a likely option as it is not a typical location for ticket sales."}

The word \"divine\" implies something supernatural or holy, so it can be inferred that the answer is referring to mundane or ordinary events. The word \"humdrum\" specifically means dull and unexciting, making it the most fitting choice among the options given. The other options, such as \"godless\" and \"cursed,\" imply a negative or supernatural connotation that would not fit the context of the question."}

Graveyards and vocations do not make sense in this context. \"Working hard\" and \"various situations\" are too general and do not provide any specific information to help us determine the correct answer."}

Given the context of the question, the most likely application of this type of rope would be to provide tension and torque to a winch, which is commonly used in construction, transportation and heavy industry to lift and move heavy loads. The other options do not seem to fit the context or application of wire ropes."}

A music shop would be the most likely place to find a variety of harmonicas to choose from and receive advice on which one to buy. The other options do not provide a plausible answer to the question."}

When a community becomes aware of this kind of behavior, they often react with outrage and demand action to be taken in order to protect the victim and ensure that the perpetrator is held accountable. This response is known as public outcry. The other options, like \"more hurt,\" \"people become happy,\" \"legal problems,\" and \"physical pain\" do not seem like likely outcomes in this scenario."}

Where is he likely to keep it?"}}, "k": "kitchen cupboard\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John bought a large quantity of salt, which is not typically used for immediate consumption. Therefore, it is more likely that he would store it in a place where he keeps other cooking ingredients such as a kitchen cupboard. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as a shaker would not hold 5 pounds of salt, sea water is not a storage location, falling down is irrelevant, and a fast food restaurant is not related to personal storage."}

It is commonly kept in a closet, along with other clothes. A suitcase is used for packing clothes when traveling, but it is unlikely that a t-shirt would be stored there. Underground is not a typical location for storing clothes. A shirtdress is a type of clothing, but it is not a location where clothes are kept. A drawer might be another option for storing clothes, but a closet is the most common and likely choice for a t-shirt."}

While some cats may be accustomed to living in alleyways or around dumpsters, this is not a preference for most cats. Likewise, while barns might provide shelter and food for some cats, tabby cats are generally more domesticated and prefer living inside homes where they can be close to their human companions. The key to the correct answer is understanding the specific characteristics and behaviors of tabby cats."}

While smoking can lead to lung disease and persistent cough, these options are unlikely to directly ruin a kiss. Birth defects are also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Bad breath, on the other hand, is a common and immediate consequence of smoking that can be a turnoff during intimacy. Ashtray could also be a possible answer, but bad breath is more directly related to the context of the sentence."}

The term \"theatre\" could also be a possibility but the use of helmets and harnesses makes it unlikely, as they would not typically be used in a theatrical setting. The inclusion of \"mountain\" does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

One possible way for a doctor to cope with this is by providing care for their patients, which can help alleviate their suffering and provide comfort. This answer also aligns with the ethical and professional obligations of a doctor to provide care and support for their patients. The other options do not offer a viable solution or may even be unethical or inappropriate in a medical setting."}

The choice \"write poems\" is the most likely answer because nature is a common subject for poetry, and the act of writing poetry is often associated with a personal and emotional connection to the natural world. The other options, such as \"advertising company\" or \"write novels,\" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or the subject of nature."}

The most likely scenario is that the children play or engage in some activity that causes their clothes to become dirty. The options \"use water,\" \"soap,\" and \"launder\" all suggest actions that could be taken to clean the clothes, making them irrelevant to the context of the sentence. \"Cry\" is not a logical answer as it has no connection to the cleanliness of the clothes."}

This knowledge eliminates the options of problems, losing money, fighting, and relaxation, as these consequences do not specifically relate to breaking the law in this manner. While it is possible that one could lose money or experience problems as a result of getting arrested, these options are not as directly related to the context of the sentence as getting arrested."}

The only option related to the window is the windowsill, which is the ledge at the bottom of the window. It is common for windowsills to require yearly maintenance, such as painting or sealing, especially on older houses where the wood may have deteriorated over time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Yeast is a microorganism that feeds on sugar in the dough and releases carbon dioxide gas, which causes the dough to expand and rise. The other options are not related to the process of making bread rise."}

In the context of the question, the word \"might\" suggests that the answer is an outcome that is possible but not guaranteed. Cancer is a disease that can arise from the growth of malignant tumors and can potentially be fatal if left untreated. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Michigan is commonly referred to as the \"glove-shaped state\" due to its resemblance to a mitten or glove. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The most likely method of delivery for a physical document is through mail, as it is a common delivery service used for sending letters and packages. The other options do not make sense in the context of physical document delivery; a legal document is usually delivered by a courier, a newspaper is delivered by a newspaper carrier, and a press release is distributed via email or online channels."}

This would keep food fresh.  This item was a type of what?"}}, "k": "baggie\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John wanted to keep his food fresh by removing air from around it. The word \"suck\" implies that John was using some sort of suction device to remove the air. Additionally, the phrase \"leaving empty space inside\" implies that the item had a cavity that could be filled with food. A baggie fits all of these criteria and is a common household item used to store food. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

As he looked to the sky, he didn't see anything holding them up.  He wondered what the balloons where?"}}, "k": "aloft\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the balloons were up in the air without any visible support. The word \"aloft\" means up in the air or high above the ground, so it makes sense in the context of the sentence. The other options may also indicate a position higher than the observer, but they do not specifically refer to being in the air or floating."}

The other options, such as trying to stay happy or experiencing, do not make sense in the context of someone who is no longer alive. \"Seeing\" and \"expire\" could potentially refer to death in certain contexts, but \"die\" is the most commonly used and straightforward term."}

Cooking dinner and cooking food are not necessarily related to the cleanliness of the kitchen, and thanking god or mopping may not be a typical response to a dirty kitchen. Therefore, washing dishes is the best answer."}

The context of the sentence also implies that the event took place in a large venue that requires tickets. The only option that matches these conditions is \"football stadium,\" which is a common location for large-scale sporting events that require ticketing. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

Of the options provided, \"killing\" is the only one that accurately reflects this meaning. \"Bleeding\" and \"knife\" are more closely related to the act of stabbing itself, while \"gruesome\" and \"mess\" describe the aftermath rather than the act itself."}

While \"victory\" and \"winning prize\" may be possible outcomes if the racer maintains their advantage until the end of the race, the most immediate result is that they will be \"ahead\" of the other racers. \"New option\" and \"fall\" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Tornadoes, on the other hand, are a type of localized wind event that can be just as destructive as hurricanes. They are characterized by a narrow, rapidly rotating column of air that can cause significant damage to buildings and other structures. While some of the other options may be associated with hurricanes, such as \"disaster\" and \"death,\" they do not have the same direct relationship as \"tornadoes.\""}

The word \"obscure\" means to obstruct or make something unclear, and is commonly used when referring to vision. Therefore, it is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "af9168feecfd75cf00085b52163caeb0", "question": {"question_concept": "net", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "ocean"}, {"label": "B", "text": "soccer game"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fishing gear"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fisherman's boat"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fishing boat"}], "stem": "Where could you find a person standing next to a net?"}}, "k": "fishing boat\nKnowledge: The mention of a net in the sentence suggests that the person is likely involved in fishing. While a soccer game may involve a net, it is not common for a person to be standing next to it. Fishing gear and a fisherman's boat could also have a net, but the specific wording of \"standing next to\" suggests that the person is on the same level as the net, which is more likely to be found on a fishing boat. The ocean alone does not provide enough context to determine if there is a net and a person standing next to it."}

The mention of a judge ruling suggests that this person was likely involved in a lawsuit or settlement following an accident. The phrase \"hitting the jackpot\" is commonly used in relation to winning a large amount of money, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence."}

A supermarket typically focuses on groceries, while a grocery store may have a limited selection of other products. A shop is a general term that could refer to a small retail establishment, but it may not necessarily have a wide selection of goods. Therefore, the mall is the best choice for finding many types of goods."}

A van is a vehicle that has smaller sliding doors, usually on the side or back. An apartment may have a standard-sized door for entry, but it is unlikely to have a large one. The neighbor's house may have a large door, but it is not a general rule. A wall does not have a door at all."}

His mother found it and put it somewhere that he could find it easily.  Where might she put it?"}}, "k": "toy box\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James plays with a ball as a toy. His mother finds it and puts it somewhere he can easily find it. A likely place for her to put it would be in a container specifically designated for toys, such as a toy box. The other options do not provide a clear connection to where a ball, or any toy, might be stored."}

From the choices, \"deny\" is the only option that fits this context. \"Forbid\" and \"reject\" imply a deliberate action, whereas \"deny\" suggests a refusal or rejection of a request or entry. \"Permitted\" does not fit with the idea of only allowing one more in, as it suggests permission to enter."}

When all of the questioners went home he experienced what emotion?"}}, "k": "sadness\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy enjoyed answering questions and implies that he was likely interacting with other people while doing so. When \"all of the questioners went home,\" it suggests that the interaction has ended and Billy may feel a sense of loss or loneliness.

In order to do that, he did something in the middle of the street.  What did he do?"}}, "k": "construct\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James did something intentional in order to ruin the parade, which implies that he planned and executed his plan. The verb \"construct\" is the most fitting choice among the options, as it conveys the idea of building or making something deliberately. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

It absorbs heat from the surrounding environment and melts, which cools the drink or food. Ice can also be used to cool water, but it is not the most common use. It can harm humans if they slip and fall on it, but that is not its typical function. Ice forms crystals as it freezes, but this is not its main purpose."}

Freezing or refrigerating the pie are common options for storage, as this helps to slow down the growth of bacteria and prevents the pie from going bad. Keeping the pie outside or on a windowsill is not recommended, as this can cause the pie to spoil quickly due to exposure to heat and humidity. Similarly, storing the pie in an oven is not appropriate, as this will not keep the pie at the proper temperature for preservation."}

While some festivals may offer games or activities, the option \"play games\" is not as commonly associated with festivals as the other options. Talking and hearing birds' voices are also not activities typically associated with festivals, while eating ice cream may be a popular food choice at festivals, it is not the primary activity that people go for."}

This is a common phenomenon that occurs when the air is cool and humid enough to cause the water vapor in our breath to condense into visible droplets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"useless\" suggests that if the computers couldn't perform this function, they were no good for John's work. The word \"enable\" fits this context because it means to make something possible or functional. The other options are not as fitting because they either do not directly connect to computers or do not describe the specific function that John needed the computers to perform."}

It would not make sense to place a bed in the garage or on the floor, as these are not suitable places for sleeping. \"Sleep\" and \"awake\" are not choices that relate to the physical placement of a bed in a space. Therefore, \"furniture\" is the most logical answer."}

These types of establishments are commonly located in urban areas with a high concentration of residents and foot traffic. The choice \"city\" makes the most sense because it is the most likely location for a beauty parlor to be found. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The most severe consequence of suicide is death, which aligns with the option \"die.\" The other options do not describe a likely outcome of suicide, and some options like \"sitting down\" do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

Drug stores may carry over-the-counter contraceptives such as condoms or spermicide, but not prescription medication. Medicine cabinets are where a person may store their own medication, but birth control pills cannot be obtained this way. Hormones may be used in medical treatments but do not refer specifically to birth control pills. Vagina is a body part and not a location for obtaining medication."}

What might they do?"}}, "k": "All of the choices could be correct, as \"rambunctious\" generally means energetic and rowdy behavior. However, it is worth noting that \"throw things\" could be the most likely option, as throwing objects is a common example of rambunctious behavior in children."}

To make grapes he needs plenty of what?"}}, "k": "sunshine\nKnowledge: Grapes need plenty of sunlight to ripen and grow successfully, which is essential for vineyards to produce good-quality grapes. Deserts, shops, kitchen, and terrain do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, and therefore cannot be the correct answer."}

A pantry is a storage space within a home, and while it may contain ingredients, it's unlikely to have fresh produce like a potato. A farmer's field and soil are where potatoes grow, but it's not practical to obtain a single potato from a field, and it may not be feasible to dig one up from soil. A cellar is a storage space, similar to a pantry, and it may contain ingredients, but it's not a common place to purchase them."}

In such a situation, soldiers may need to call for backup, or reinforcements, to help them turn the tide of the battle. Following orders and using weapons are actions that soldiers would typically take in any battle situation but do not specifically address what happens when opponents gain the upper hand. Coming home and dying in battle are not actions that soldiers can take in the middle of a battle."}

The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A garderobe is a historical term for a toilet or privy, a drawer is too small for storing a dress shirt, a suitcase is for travel and not for daily use, and \"absence heat\" is not a recognizable phrase."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "c7353a600c53af0c11130379852e5df8", "question": {"question_concept": "programs", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "group functions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "conference"}, {"label": "C", "text": "theater"}, {"label": "D", "text": "compute"}, {"label": "E", "text": "television"}], "stem": "Bob is happy that the programs he was in will be seen by millions of people.  Where will these programs be shown?"}}, "k": "television\nKnowledge: The sentence specifically mentions that the programs will be seen by millions of people. The options \"group functions,\" \"conference,\" and \"theater\" suggest a limited audience size, whereas \"compute\" is not a relevant option. Therefore, the correct answer is likely \"television,\" which has the potential to reach a vast audience."}

It is specifically designed for storage and dispensing of beer, often holding anywhere from 5-15 gallons of beer at a time. The other options are not related to the context of storing beer in large quantities."}

The plants were the same, the trees were the same, but it still wasn't right  Where did the monkey come from?"}}, "k": "rain forest\nKnowledge: The context clues suggest that the monkey's home was a rain forest, as the plants and trees were mentioned as being familiar to him. The other options, such as treetops, tundra, playful mood, and Brazil, do not fit with the description of the monkey's habitat."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "ea2a09b03452854c33d720188ff8cc96", "question": {"question_concept": "tickets", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "train station"}, {"label": "B", "text": "opera"}, {"label": "C", "text": "car rental shop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "show"}, {"label": "E", "text": "race track"}], "stem": "John needed to go across the country so he ordered tickets online and got into his car.  Where might he be going?"}}, "k": "car rental shop\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John ordered tickets online and got into his car, indicating that he will be driving to his destination. None of the other options involve driving or going across the country, making car rental shop the most likely choice."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "93fa762c32b9a1ab1dec68a7011e6d58", "question": {"question_concept": "joy", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "place plate on table"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sadness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sorrow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "misery"}, {"label": "E", "text": "bad time"}], "stem": "The woman called herself the Joy.  She married a man called what?"}}, "k": "None of the choices are correct.\nKnowledge: The sentence does not provide any clear indication of what the man's name might be, so none of the options are correct. The fact that the woman calls herself \"the Joy\" may suggest that she has a cheerful personality or that she is known for bringing happiness to others, but it does not provide any clues about her husband's name."}

The entrance hall alone was impressive, being wide enough to admit a hundred shoulder to shoulder.  But the building was owned by a billionaire and used only for his personal entertainment.  How would you describe this place?"}}, "k": "large building\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the building is spacious enough to accommodate a significant number of people, and the entrance hall is wide enough to admit a hundred people shoulder to shoulder. This implies that the building is not a small or medium-sized one, but rather a large building. Additionally, it also mentions that the building belongs to a billionaire and is used only for personal entertainment, which implies that it is not a public building or convention center. School and town hall are also not applicable as they have specific purposes and are usually used by the community rather than being privately owned."}

These fossils can be found in various locations, but the most common place to see them on display is in a museum. Museums often have collections of fossils and dinosaur bones that have been excavated from around the world. The other options, such as the human body, arm, tomb or pyramid, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

It is not typically considered a home, though it may be a part of one. It is also not located downtown, as it is typically situated at or near a residence. While it is primarily used for storage, it is not exclusively a storage area, as it may also be used for other purposes such as working on cars. The most appropriate choice is therefore \"building,\" as a garage is a specific kind of structure."}

The terms \"suburbs\" and \"farm house\" also suggest a residential setting, but do not provide any specific indication of the size or layout of the property. \"Palace\" and \"country estate\" suggest a larger and more grandiose setting, but are not necessarily associated with walkout basements or back courtyards. Therefore, \"large house\" is the most appropriate choice."}

One option is an atlas, which is a collection of maps and geographical information. An atlas can help the speaker locate their current location and plan a route to their destination. The other options do not provide the same kind of navigational support as an atlas."}

Hallways are typically the spaces that connect different rooms in a building, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Carpet is a type of flooring material, exchange refers to the act of trading or swapping, dance is a type of activity, and building refers to the structure itself, none of which directly relate to the question."}

She put it in her car and took it somewhere. Where might she take it?"}}, "k": "trunk\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Lily bought some new clothing and put it in her car. Since she didn't take it home (house) or put it away in a drawer or closet, she may have taken it somewhere else. Putting items in the trunk of a car is a common way to transport items from one place to another, especially when they are too large or numerous to carry by hand. The yard sale option is unlikely since Lily just bought the clothing and wouldn't be selling it at a yard sale."}

The options \"jocks,\" \"health club,\" and \"gymnasium\" may have locker rooms but are not necessarily venues with significant media coverage. \"Hatred\" is an unrelated choice. Therefore, the correct answer is \"stadium,\" a place where major sporting events are held and where reporters frequent the locker rooms to conduct interviews and gather news."}

Out of the choices given, only \"sit down\" makes sense as it is an action that enables a person to be seated. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence."}

This may suggest that John believes that religious beliefs and scientific ideas can coexist peacefully without conflicting with each other. The other options, such as wars or atheism, are not related to the idea of a lack of conflict between religion and something else."}

The option \"arguments\" reflects this possibility. The other options do not necessarily follow from the premise of the question, as the couple may still be able to relax, enjoy, go abroad, or spend money even if they disagree about the details of the vacation."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "d0ee686c19689e5da9caafa3d8f8942f", "question": {"question_concept": "telling many people about", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "hand signals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "speak"}, {"label": "C", "text": "shout"}, {"label": "D", "text": "earthquake"}, {"label": "E", "text": "yell"}], "stem": "When you're telling many people about something you will need to do what to address them?"}}, "k": "speak\nKnowledge: The sentence is referring to addressing a group of people, which is typically done through speaking. Hand signals may be used to emphasize or clarify a point, but they are not a primary method of communication when addressing a group. Shouting, yelling, and earthquakes are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

This implies that the answer is related to life and death. Out of the given choices, only \"expect to die\" fits this context. The other choices do not relate to the topic of mortality and have no clear connection to the sentence."}

Rest areas, bus depots, and train stations are typically used for shorter distance travel within a particular region or country. \"Book tickets\" is also a misleading option as it only refers to the act of buying tickets and does not provide any context about where travelers would gather."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, it can be inferred that computers with audio cards are capable of producing sound. The other options may or may not be true, but they are not directly related to the function of an audio card."}

The fact that it is described as \"complex\" implies that it is not a simple or common item that can be easily found in a regular retail store. This narrows down the options to a computer store or a place that specializes in selling complex machinery or equipment. However, since the options are limited and the word \"computer\" is mentioned in one of the choices, it is safe to assume that the correct answer is \"computer store\". The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The use of the word \"crass\" and \"rude\" further suggests that the man's behavior may have been disrespectful or offensive. Therefore, the most likely group of people to file a complaint would be women, as they are commonly targeted by sexist behavior in the workplace. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "8a2e776c8704404232b3e77c7240f6c4", "question": {"question_concept": "spider", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "in wall"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cellar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "floor"}, {"label": "D", "text": "web"}, {"label": "E", "text": "basement"}], "stem": "Where are there often spiders in a house?"}}, "k": "in wall\nKnowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to places within a house where spiders are commonly found. Spiders are known to create webs, so the option \"web\" could also be a possibility, but the question is asking for the location rather than the creation. Spiders also tend to hide in dark and cluttered areas, which would make options like \"cellar\" and \"basement\" plausible as well. However, the option \"in wall\" is the most likely answer as spiders can often be found in the cracks and crevices of walls where they can hide and build their webs."}

Financial security, quick marriage, and owning a house do not necessarily have to do with dating, while \"live well\" is a vague term that could mean many things. \"Good relationship\" is the only option that directly relates to the purpose of a dating website."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "48e3cbdc1155bf12571d6ceee62c2635", "question": {"question_concept": "death", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "poisonous gas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "homicide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "suicide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "poison leaves"}, {"label": "E", "text": "nuclear weapons"}], "stem": "What leads to mass death?"}}, "k": "poisonous gas\nKnowledge: The question is asking about a cause of mass death, which suggests a large-scale event or tragedy. The choices of homicide and suicide both refer to individual acts and are not likely to result in mass death. Poison leaves may cause harm to individuals who ingest them, but they would not cause mass death. Nuclear weapons are extremely destructive, but their use is relatively rare and the question does not specify a war or conflict scenario. Poisonous gas, however, is a well-known cause of mass death in certain contexts, such as chemical attacks or accidents involving hazardous chemicals."}

Sharing things is a common behavior in collectivist cultures because it supports the idea of working together for the common good of the group. The other options do not have a clear association with collectivism."}

But this is a tall order, because flowers grow all over what?"}}, "k": "surface of earth\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the scope of flowers Lilly hopes to see is vast and encompasses all types of flowers. The other options are more specific and not as broad as the surface of the earth, which includes all types of environments where flowers may exist. The Netherlands, countryside, state park, and anthology are all limited subsets of the surface of the earth and do not encompass all types of flowers."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "992d5c6f881afb409966fb17d3352e6e", "question": {"question_concept": "tennis court", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "recreational center"}, {"label": "B", "text": "athletic club"}, {"label": "C", "text": "soccer field"}, {"label": "D", "text": "town"}, {"label": "E", "text": "college campus"}], "stem": "The student liked to play tennis, she frequented the tennis court on the what?"}}, "k": "college campus\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the student is a college student who enjoys playing tennis on campus. Recreational centers and athletic clubs are commonly associated with local community centers or private facilities, and soccer fields do not typically have tennis courts. The options \"town\" and \"college campus\" both seem plausible, but the mention of the student as a \"student\" implies that the correct answer is \"college campus.\""}

The term \"hot\" is commonly used to describe food that has been heated to a high temperature, and is therefore not cold. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

The option to \"eat healthily\" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to the topic of weight and health. Options like \"run faster\" and \"look better\" are not relevant because they do not address the issue of health directly. \"Stay fit\" and \"get in shape\" are close, but they do not clearly explain how one can achieve those fitness goals, while \"eat healthily\" does."}

He finds that it makes him what?"}}, "k": "Feeling better\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that James listens to something after a hard day and along with a cool bath. This suggests that the activity helps him relax and feel better. The options \"ardor,\" \"amusement,\" and \"enlightenment\" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. \"Fall asleep\" could be a possibility, but the sentence only suggests that listening to something helps James feel better, not that it necessarily puts him to sleep."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "ed0d26ee55aaf225daba99ff0020b669", "question": {"question_concept": "babies", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "like spinach"}, {"label": "B", "text": "laugh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sleep soundly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "giggle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "clap hands"}], "stem": "For a stressed out mother a baby is cutest when it is able to what?"}}, "k": "sleep soundly\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions a stressed out mother, which suggests that the baby's behavior is related to calming the mother down. Of the choices provided, sleep soundly is the only option that implies a quiet and peaceful behavior, which is likely to soothe a stressed out mother. Laughing, giggling, and clapping hands may be cute, but they are also likely to be noisy and may not produce the desired effect. Liking spinach is not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

While it can also be found in oceans and seas, the context of the question suggests that the answer is more likely to be related to an area where people can physically access large quantities of driftwood, which is more commonly found on beaches. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "b67f97a3fd9f4025d34f927a7a616512", "question": {"question_concept": "balls", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sporting event"}, {"label": "B", "text": "gym"}, {"label": "C", "text": "toy store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "baseball"}, {"label": "E", "text": "soccer game"}], "stem": "When black and white balls are kicked with feet what is being played?"}}, "k": "soccer game\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that black and white balls are being kicked with feet, which is a common activity in soccer. Soccer is a sport that involves using one's feet to control a ball and score goals, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Motion sickness is a related condition that can also occur when the body senses movement but the eyes cannot detect it, such as when traveling in a car. Jet lag is a condition caused by crossing time zones and can cause fatigue and disrupted sleep patterns. Diarrhea is not typically associated with traveling on the water but can be a common issue while traveling in areas with different food or water sources. Fatigue is a general feeling of tiredness that can be caused by a variety of factors but is not specific to traveling on the water."}

The term \"conference\" typically refers to a gathering of professionals or experts in a specific field, where they discuss and present their research or ideas. The other options, such as think tank, group functions, theater, and television, do not necessarily have the same connotation of an organized event with a specific focus on programs or offerings."}

They are less common in cities and on interstate highways. England and Europe also have toll roads, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that the motorway mentioned is located in either of these places."}

Being unemployed means that a person does not have a job or is not currently employed. The other options - do nothing, play, celebrate, and laziness - are not directly related to employment status and do not provide a suitable answer for the question."}

The option \"anywhere on earth\" is the only one that fits this context, as the other options are either unrelated or specific locations within space or on Earth."}

The other options, such as \"speaking from mouth\" and \"voice\" are not accurate descriptions of someone who is talking a lot and being lively. \"Blabbering\" is a negative connotation and doesn't necessarily imply that the person is being lively. \"Speech\" is a noun and doesn't accurately describe the behavior or attitude of the person who is talking."}

Where might have he been walking?"}}, "k": "street\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John cut his feet on broken glass while walking, which is more likely to occur on a hard surface like a street rather than softer surfaces like a landfill, field or beach. Trash is also unlikely to be the location as broken glass would not typically be found scattered on the ground in a trash area."}

The options \"gain weight,\" \"getting fit,\" and \"gas\" do not necessarily suggest a health problem. \"Getting sick\" is too general, and could refer to any number of conditions, while \"obesity\" specifically relates to a condition caused by excessive weight gain."}

Farting is a common bodily function that may disrupt others around you, whereas gaining weight, feeling jealous, or experiencing heartburn or bad breath do not necessarily have an immediate or direct impact on others."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "3a64e4fa87a378a16a36b9d22624097e", "question": {"question_concept": "human", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "torture"}, {"label": "B", "text": "be clear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "think and reason"}, {"label": "D", "text": "think critically"}, {"label": "E", "text": "have fever"}], "stem": "The robot could do lots of things, but unlike a human when presented with new situations it could not what?"}}, "k": "think and reason\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the robot has limitations when it comes to processing new or unfamiliar situations. \"Thinking and reasoning\" is an ability that is closely associated with the human brain and is often cited as a defining characteristic of human intelligence. The other options (\"torture,\" \"be clear,\" \"think critically,\" and \"have fever\") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "2629ca18004abbc657c4ef4c5709c89e", "question": {"question_concept": "having sex", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "making babies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bliss"}, {"label": "C", "text": "unwanted pregnancy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "aids"}, {"label": "E", "text": "orgasm"}], "stem": "What did having sex as a gay man lead to twenty years ago?"}}, "k": "aids\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that there was a negative consequence associated with having sex as a gay man twenty years ago. During the 1980s and 1990s, AIDS was a major health crisis among gay men, and unprotected sex could lead to the transmission of the disease. While some of the other options may be tangentially related to the topic of sex, only AIDS directly fits the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "c4f382ab740bbd459add367673c541ad", "question": {"question_concept": "getting drunk", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "getting arrested"}, {"label": "B", "text": "throw up"}, {"label": "C", "text": "staggering"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fall down"}, {"label": "E", "text": "explode"}], "stem": "While getting drunk the body can only process so much at a time, go too fast and your belly might just make you what?"}}, "k": "throw up\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that drinking too much alcohol too quickly can lead to a bodily reaction of expelling the alcohol, commonly known as vomiting or throwing up. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "91b03d518a48cfb672c0792439269ef2", "question": {"question_concept": "playing tennis", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "legs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "skill"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hand"}, {"label": "D", "text": "competition"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tennis racket"}], "stem": "Playing tennis can be a great workout, all the lateral movement really gets the whats?"}}, "k": "legs\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that playing tennis involves a lot of lateral movement, which would require the use of leg muscles. Additionally, the phrase \"great workout\" implies that physical exercise is involved, which would further support the idea that the answer is \"legs.\" The other options do not seem to be directly related to the context of the sentence - \"skill\" and \"competition\" may be important aspects of playing tennis, but they do not necessarily relate to the physical demands of the sport."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "fc0da82fa08e2a3ea1d7a33d4eab54e1", "question": {"question_concept": "snake", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "pet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rude"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tropical forest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "sun itself"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tree"}], "stem": "The snake was very cold inside it's cage, so at the first opportunity it did what?"}}, "k": "sun itself \nKnowledge: Since the sentence describes a cold snake in a cage, it can be inferred that the snake is trying to warm itself up. The choice \"sun itself\" makes the most sense, as snakes are known to bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature. The other options, such as \"pet\" or \"rude\", do not provide any logical connection to the situation described. \"Tropical forest\" or \"tree\" could be possible answers if the context suggested that the snake was trying to escape or find shelter in a natural habitat, which is not the case in this sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "63c627a71ca643b9656cf059cb888b00", "question": {"question_concept": "relaxing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "feeling better"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lie back"}, {"label": "C", "text": "lower blood pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "feel happy"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fall asleep"}], "stem": "John thought that it was relaxing to do what?"}}, "k": "lie back\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John found something to be relaxing, and the phrase \"lie back\" is commonly associated with relaxation. The other options may also have some connection to relaxation, but none of them are directly mentioned in the sentence. Feeling better, lower blood pressure, and feeling happy may all be benefits of relaxation, but they are not the action itself. Falling asleep may be a form of relaxation, but it is not the action that is being described in the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "aff9a59b91e0bb6727cb4d108e80f6f7", "question": {"question_concept": "human", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "jail"}, {"label": "B", "text": "train station"}, {"label": "C", "text": "workplace"}, {"label": "D", "text": "church"}, {"label": "E", "text": "park"}], "stem": "Where may a human find peace?"}}, "k": "park\nKnowledge: Parks are commonly associated with peacefulness and relaxation. They often offer natural scenery and environments that can help people to unwind from the stresses of everyday life. Choices such as jail, train station, and workplace are typically associated with stress and tension, while churches may offer spiritual comfort but may not necessarily provide the same sense of tranquility as a park."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "f555be85f4c60689eac83c095156213d", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "garage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "white house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "synagogue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hospital"}, {"label": "E", "text": "demonstration"}], "stem": "A person surrounded by tools and oil cans would probably be found in a what?"}}, "k": "garage\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is surrounded by tools and oil cans, which are commonly found in garages. Garages are spaces where people usually store and work on vehicles or other machinery, so it makes sense that the person would be found in a garage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "84b9a0ecab7a6ba89a1c254fad771465", "question": {"question_concept": "car", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "going too fast"}, {"label": "B", "text": "last several years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "go fast"}, {"label": "D", "text": "careless driving"}, {"label": "E", "text": "start running"}], "stem": "Why did the police office pull the car over?"}}, "k": "careless driving\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the police officer pulled over the car because of the way it was being driven. The phrase \"careless driving\" indicates that the driver was not paying enough attention to the road, which could be due to a variety of careless behaviors. The other options \"going too fast\", \"go fast\", and \"start running\" all suggest that the car was driving at high speeds, which is not necessarily the reason for the pull over. The phrase \"last several years\" does not make any sense in the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "7ba380643e0bc81b0e0b5c79b3f39913", "question": {"question_concept": "movies", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "entertaining"}, {"label": "B", "text": "theasres"}, {"label": "C", "text": "funny"}, {"label": "D", "text": "watched on videos"}, {"label": "E", "text": "excellent"}], "stem": "People like to watch movies to escape for a couple hours, they find them very what?"}}, "k": "entertaining\nKnowledge: The sentence states that people watch movies to \"escape for a couple hours,\" suggesting that they find them enjoyable or entertaining. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Theatres are a place where movies are watched but are not inherently enjoyable, funny is a specific type of movie genre and does not apply to all movies, watched on videos is not related to the context of the sentence, and excellent is a subjective term that does not necessarily imply enjoyment."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "020cdc0345d11eeace08a13cae31a8f9", "question": {"question_concept": "satchel", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "room"}, {"label": "B", "text": "desk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "clothing store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "school"}, {"label": "E", "text": "luggage compartment"}], "stem": "Where in your home would you store a satchel?"}}, "k": "room\nKnowledge: A satchel is a type of bag or container typically used for carrying books or other personal items. It is most likely to be stored in a room, such as a bedroom or study, where it can be easily accessed and kept safe. A desk may also be a possible location for storing a satchel, particularly if it is used for work or studying. The other options, such as a clothing store, school or luggage compartment, are less likely to be the appropriate place for storing a satchel."}

It is common for hematite to have varying levels of iron within its structure, which can result in some areas of it having iron, while other areas do not. The other options, such as linen closets, houses, laundry rooms, and chemistry labs, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or have negative connotations."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "f5baaaf2ba2034e192eef0d4cdc8aead", "question": {"question_concept": "respect", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "befriending"}, {"label": "B", "text": "disparagement"}, {"label": "C", "text": "ignoring"}, {"label": "D", "text": "dishonor"}, {"label": "E", "text": "contumely"}], "stem": "John wanted respect, but  Lud didn't even act like he was alive.  What was Lud doing?"}}, "k": "ignoring\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Lud was not giving John any attention or acknowledgement, which aligns with the definition of ignoring. Befriending means to make friends with, disparagement means criticism or belittlement, dishonor means loss of respect or reputation, and contumely means insulting language or treatment - none of which fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "599d1f8dbd147c06b31ae490af37698f", "question": {"question_concept": "country", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "asia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "canada"}, {"label": "C", "text": "africa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "great outdoors"}, {"label": "E", "text": "region"}], "stem": "What continent  has a country with a historical wall?"}}, "k": "asia\nKnowledge: Walls with historical significance are commonly associated with Asia, specifically the Great Wall of China. This wall is a well-known and iconic landmark in China and is often associated with the country's history and culture. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "519b34b7eca34f4655d3a5c64ac85f27", "question": {"question_concept": "changing society", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "happy times ahead"}, {"label": "B", "text": "change in leadership"}, {"label": "C", "text": "better standard of living"}, {"label": "D", "text": "no water"}, {"label": "E", "text": "acceptance"}], "stem": "Out changing society meets a lot of resistance by people who like the old way of things.   But slowly, new ways gain what?"}}, "k": "acceptance\nKnowledge: The first part of the sentence indicates that there is resistance to change in the society, which implies that the new ways are not immediately accepted. However, the second part of the sentence suggests that over time, these new ways gradually gain acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer is acceptance. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "cbab7a046c81af1c5b6da93d714059b9", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "learn from each other"}, {"label": "B", "text": "jump to conclusions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hurry home"}, {"label": "D", "text": "build trust"}, {"label": "E", "text": "talk to each other"}], "stem": "What do people do when they remember that they left their oven turned on?"}}, "k": "hurry home\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that someone remembered that they left their oven turned on and the most logical option would be to hurry home to turn it off. It is unlikely that people would jump to conclusions, build trust, or learn from each other in this situation, so these options can be eliminated. \"Talk to each other\" is also unlikely to be the correct answer as the situation is not one that requires communication with others."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "0b16e37c515c83e1b6b00b26146f3f39", "question": {"question_concept": "hair dryer", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "drug store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "high end store"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beauty salon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "box"}, {"label": "E", "text": "bathroom"}], "stem": "Prescriptions being the specialty the store charges higher prices for most other goods, I'd be paying for convenience if I bought a hair dryer where?"}}, "k": "drug store\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the store specializes in prescriptions, which implies that it is a drug store. The sentence also suggests that the store charges higher prices for most other goods, which might deter customers from buying non-essential items there. Therefore, buying a hair dryer at this store would likely be convenient but more expensive. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "3648baf1d83666decd5b785de558a761", "question": {"question_concept": "playing poker", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "skill"}, {"label": "B", "text": "losing money"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bet their shoes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "ante"}, {"label": "E", "text": "attention"}], "stem": "The high rollers began playing poker, there were no blinds so they all did what?"}}, "k": "ante\nKnowledge: The absence of blinds in a poker game indicates that the players have to make a mandatory bet to participate in the game, which is called an ante. The sentence suggests that the players started playing despite the absence of blinds, which means that they must have used an alternate method of initiating the game, which is most likely the ante. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "ffa961d537f245cddef8565dbd642b1c", "question": {"question_concept": "beaver", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "beaverton"}, {"label": "B", "text": "canada"}, {"label": "C", "text": "river or stream"}, {"label": "D", "text": "kentucky"}, {"label": "E", "text": "montana"}], "stem": "What state north of alabama has many a beaver?"}}, "k": "Kentucky\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that a state north of Alabama is known for having many beavers. Kentucky is located directly north of Alabama and is home to a diverse range of habitats that support beaver populations, including rivers, streams, and wetlands. Beaverton is a city in Oregon, Canada is a country located north of the United States, Montana is located in the northwest region of the US, and \"river or stream\" is not a state name."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "a204562f50701287e1103b813f791a65", "question": {"question_concept": "laser", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "nasa"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cd players"}, {"label": "C", "text": "laboratory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hospital"}, {"label": "E", "text": "othamologist's office"}], "stem": "Where would you find people using a laser to alleviate suffering?"}}, "k": "hospital\nKnowledge: The question suggests that the use of a laser is intended to alleviate suffering, which is a common medical application of lasers. The options \"nasa\" and \"CD players\" are unrelated to medical practices, and \"laboratory\" could refer to any number of scientific fields. \"Ophthalmologist's office\" is a medical setting, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that a laser would be used to alleviate suffering in that particular context. \"Hospital\" is the most logical choice, as it is a medical facility where patients receive treatment for a range of illnesses and injuries."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "1697aefcd4b6f7c0e329e431bb5a95d2", "question": {"question_concept": "cars", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "cost money"}, {"label": "B", "text": "slow down"}, {"label": "C", "text": "move people"}, {"label": "D", "text": "get to town"}, {"label": "E", "text": "cars are cheap"}], "stem": "Why do some people choose to not own cars?"}}, "k": "cost money\nKnowledge: The question asks for a reason why some people choose to not own cars. One possible reason is that cars can be expensive to own and maintain, which makes them a financial burden for some people. The other options do not address the financial aspect of owning a car and, therefore, are not relevant to the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "57cee4603c0f07e51f9efdb6d47624c7", "question": {"question_concept": "driving to work", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "listen to radio"}, {"label": "C", "text": "listen to music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "speed"}, {"label": "E", "text": "head bang"}], "stem": "Driving to work can be monotonous, she would play her favorite music and just what along with it?"}}, "k": "sing\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person would play their favorite music during their monotonous commute to work. It then goes on to suggest that they would \"just ____ along with it.\" Speeding or headbanging do not fit the context of this sentence and are not a common activity during a daily commute. Listening to the radio or music are also possibilities, but the sentence includes the word \"just\" which implies that the person was doing something in addition to listening to music. The most plausible answer is singing along with the music they were playing."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "f8cb4a59e770d2fa4f9e2a0d2077dbb8", "question": {"question_concept": "getting warm", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "stroke"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pleasure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "increase of temperature"}, {"label": "D", "text": "get hot"}, {"label": "E", "text": "euphoria"}], "stem": "Lilly was still getting warm.  She ran her hands over John's body, he kissed her.  She couldn't think straight anymore.  Every nerve was tingling.  Nothing ever felt so right. She was experiencing what?"}}, "k": "euphoria\nKnowledge: The description of Lilly running her hands over John's body, being kissed, feeling every nerve tingle, and nothing ever feeling so right suggests that she is experiencing intense pleasure and euphoria. The other options, such as stroke, increase of temperature, and get hot, do not fit the context of the sentence and do not accurately describe Lilly's experience."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "741c8a8cfaf21354d19d34443cde244c", "question": {"question_concept": "jellyfish", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "atlantic ocean"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bikini bottom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "japanese restaurant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "pacific ocean"}], "stem": "Where might  jellyfish stay warm?"}}, "k": "none of the above (jellyfish are cold-blooded and do not regulate their body temperature)\nKnowledge: Jellyfish are cold-blooded and do not generate their own body heat, so they do not actively seek warmth. They are found in many oceanic regions, including the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, but the location does not necessarily impact their body temperature. Bikini Bottom and Japanese restaurant are fictional or human-made locations and have no relation to the natural habitat or behavior of jellyfish. The option \"store\" is also irrelevant as jellyfish are not commonly kept as pets or sold in stores."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "d1f76941ca3d63b5610f2c548d5d6ad1", "question": {"question_concept": "basketball", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "dribbling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "full of air"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bouncing around court"}, {"label": "D", "text": "punctured"}, {"label": "E", "text": "round"}], "stem": "It is hard to predict a rebound in basketball, this is because the ball and rim are what?"}}, "k": "round\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the difficulty in predicting a rebound in basketball is due to some characteristic of the ball or rim. The options \"dribbling,\" \"bouncing around court,\" and \"full of air\" do not refer to a characteristic of the ball or rim that would make it difficult to predict a rebound. The option \"punctured\" would make the ball behave in an unpredictable way, but this is not the reason why rebounds are difficult to predict. The option \"round\" makes sense because a round ball and rim can produce unpredictable bounces and rebounds."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "35fa218271f4d47503f7420ab1be8568", "question": {"question_concept": "beaver", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "japan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ontario"}, {"label": "C", "text": "washington"}, {"label": "D", "text": "woodlands"}, {"label": "E", "text": "books"}], "stem": "The beaver swam through the country he symbolized, where was he likely to be?"}}, "k": "woodlands\nKnowledge: Beavers are often associated with their role in building dams and lodges in wooded areas near bodies of water, such as rivers and ponds. This suggests that the beaver in the sentence is likely to be in a similar setting, such as a wooded area, rather than in a specific country or state. Therefore, the correct answer is \"woodlands\", while the other choices can be eliminated based on their lack of relevance to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "826ec860a4a1e1999a938942635c2de9", "question": {"question_concept": "program", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "opera"}, {"label": "B", "text": "concert"}, {"label": "C", "text": "television"}, {"label": "D", "text": "symphonic"}, {"label": "E", "text": "computer"}], "stem": "Which group is the cover for tonight's musical program?"}}, "k": "concert\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a musical program happening tonight, and one of the groups listed will serve as the cover for that program. \"Opera\" and \"symphonic\" refer to specific types of music rather than groups that would perform at a program. \"Television\" and \"computer\" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Concert\" is the most likely choice, as it refers to a performance by a group of musicians and is often used as a synonym for \"musical program.\""}

The other options, such as house, rug, and shoe store, do not offer dining room tables. Home is a more general term and can refer to any physical dwelling, so it does not specifically indicate where to get a dining room table."}

One possible outcome of feeling tired is that a person may become lazy or unmotivated to do things. This is supported by the fact that tiredness can cause physical and mental fatigue, which can make it harder to focus and be productive. The other options in the list do not have a clear connection to the idea of being tired as a primary cause."}

Therefore, buying products could create disagreements between the couple since they may have different ideas about what is essential to buy and what is not. The other options do not adequately reflect the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "6fee410a4010d5da81e0b3dd2311490e", "question": {"question_concept": "destroy", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "demolish object"}, {"label": "B", "text": "repair"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fix"}, {"label": "D", "text": "create"}, {"label": "E", "text": "construct"}], "stem": "If something attempted to destroy something but didn't fully succeed, then one might be able to do what to it afterwards?"}}, "k": "repair\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the object in question was damaged but not completely destroyed. In such a case, repairing the damage would be a logical next step. Demolishing the object, creating a new one, or constructing something new would not be appropriate actions to take if the object is still salvageable. \"Fix\" and \"repair\" are essentially synonymous in this context, but \"repair\" may sound more appropriate in this instance because it suggests fixing something that was broken or damaged."}

It would be highly unusual to put a furnace in such a situation because it would be a waste of resources and materials to heat a temporary living space with a permanent heating system. The other options all suggest permanent living situations where a furnace is a common and necessary source of heat."}

Therefore, it can be inferred that the answer choice that relates to cleanliness is the correct one. The other choices - mistakes, errors, neatness, and beauty - are either unrelated or do not fully capture the meaning of grooming."}

Putting it in a basket, desk, or mail box would not effectively dispose of it, and would likely lead to clutter and confusion. A waste bin or trash can is the most appropriate place to discard junk mail."}

Housekeeping was supposed to do it, but it was easy for him, and this place was cheap.  Where is Billy?"}}, "k": "motel\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions housekeeping, suggesting that Billy is staying in a place where there is a cleaning staff. The description of the place as \"cheap\" further supports the idea that he is staying in a budget motel, as this type of lodging often does not have daily housekeeping services. The other options, dump, office, park, and corner, do not fit the context provided in the sentence."}

The correct answer must therefore indicate the action of taking a breath, not exhaling or other breathing-related activities. \"Inhale\" and \"inhaling\" both suggest the act of breathing in, rather than holding one's breath. \"Wheeze\" suggests strained breathing or difficulty breathing, which is not indicated in the sentence. \"Meditate\" is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, \"take breath\" is the best option."}

Agitation is a feeling of annoyance or irritation, which is a common reaction to someone cutting in line. Fainting, hunger, boredom, and pain are not likely to be a result of someone cutting in front of you in line."}

The options of dishwasher and restaurant also do not make sense as places to buy an antique plate. The most likely option is flea market, as these types of markets are known for selling a variety of vintage and antique items."}

The Stone Age is a period of prehistory known for the development of tools and weapons made from stone, and it is also a time when mammoths roamed the Earth alongside early humans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Intoxication is a common term used to describe the state of being drunk or under the influence of alcohol. Blazed and being sick do not necessarily refer to getting drunk specifically, while vomiting and hangover are related to the symptoms and aftermath of alcohol consumption rather than the act of drinking itself."}

Libraries and office buildings may not have public restrooms available, and restaurants may require you to make a purchase before using their facilities. Therefore, the best choice for finding a restroom while on the road is a gas station."}

City councils typically hold public meetings that members of the public can attend to hear about city business, ask questions, and provide feedback. The other options, such as a business or office building, do not necessarily involve a committee, and a temple typically does not have public meetings. A boardroom could involve a committee, but it is not specifically related to the context of the question."}

Happiness is often associated with positive emotions and a feeling of contentment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options do not necessarily relate to the idea of having a good time or chatting with friends."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "5f19bce44eec43fadd95e9c26cd20db5", "question": {"question_concept": "standard", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "informal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "colloquial"}, {"label": "C", "text": "nonstandard"}, {"label": "D", "text": "standard wing"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stanine"}], "stem": "The tool didn't fit the bolt, and the tool had a standard sizing, what was the bolt like?"}}, "k": "nonstandard\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the tool had a standard sizing, implying that the bolt did not match this standard size. The word \"fit\" reinforces this idea, as it implies that the two objects did not match up properly. Knowing the definitions of the other options can also help eliminate them as possible answers - \"informal\" and \"colloquial\" relate to language use, not tools and bolts, while \"standard wing\" and \"stanine\" are not commonly used terms in this context."}

The most logical option would be a bus station, as it is a place specifically designed for these kinds of transfers. While the other options may have bus stops, they do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The phrase \"his back courtyard\" also implies that it is a private and enclosed space within the king's residence. The other options do not have the same association with royalty or the idea of a personal courtyard in a private residence."}

The most logical option among the choices is a toy store, as this is where children would be more likely to be present and the salesperson would need to engage with them to make sales. The other options do not have a strong connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "54549f8b11a5ccd447bbd7e50b389ef3", "question": {"question_concept": "pebble", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "lake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "playground"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pond"}, {"label": "D", "text": "aquarium"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stucco"}], "stem": "Where could you find a pebble that has been walked on?"}}, "k": "playground\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that a pebble that has been walked on is likely to be found in a location where people frequently walk. Playgrounds are a common place where people walk and play, and it's possible that children might have kicked around or stepped on pebbles while playing. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Ever since, he was afraid of what?"}}, "k": "being trapped\nKnowledge: The sentence states that Brother Mike escaped from a collapsed mine, which suggests that he was in a situation where he was trapped or stuck. Therefore, it makes sense that he would be afraid of being trapped again, and the option \"being trapped\" aligns with this logic. The other choices do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence, as they imply a different kind of danger or threat."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "7bb8b4dff85ab1f0b554f060b2728111", "question": {"question_concept": "onions", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "market"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pizza"}, {"label": "C", "text": "refrigerator"}, {"label": "D", "text": "servant"}, {"label": "E", "text": "table"}], "stem": "Max looked for the onions so that he could  made a stew.  Where might he have looked?"}}, "k": "refrigerator\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Max was looking for onions to cook a stew, which implies that he is most likely going to search in the kitchen or a place where food is stored. Out of the given options, the refrigerator is the most logical choice as it is the common storage for perishable foods like onions. The other options are unlikely places for finding onions for a stew."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "ec93ff28af711d5420fdfd6e71851669", "question": {"question_concept": "religion", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "atheism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "atheist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "science"}, {"label": "D", "text": "wars"}, {"label": "E", "text": "confusing"}], "stem": "Religion plays a big role in many lives, but the what in the room is oddly often the most preachy?"}}, "k": "atheism\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that while religion plays a significant role in many people's lives, there is an aspect of it that is often overly preachy. The choice \"atheism\" is likely correct as it is the option that is most similar in context to religion, and the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Atheism is often associated with a rejection of religion and a reliance on science or logic, which could explain why it is sometimes seen as preachy or pushy in contrast to religion."}

How is television different from radio?"}}, "k": "visual\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John believes that television and radio are different, and the answer choice that best explains the difference is \"visual.\" Television provides a visual component that radio does not, as it displays moving images and often incorporates elements such as text and graphics, whereas radio is predominantly audio-based. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of John's statement, and there is no indication that conformity or laziness are related to the differences between television and radio."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "ff4a0b9355126b3eb7d553ed5457a168", "question": {"question_concept": "car", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "roll over"}, {"label": "B", "text": "move quickly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "slow down"}, {"label": "D", "text": "go fast"}, {"label": "E", "text": "be late"}], "stem": "What can happen to your car if you take a corner at too high a velocity?"}}, "k": "roll over\nKnowledge: The phrase \"take a corner at too high a velocity\" suggests that the car is traveling at a high speed and making a turn. When a vehicle takes a turn too quickly, the centripetal force acting on the car can cause it to lose control and roll over. The other options do not accurately describe the consequences of taking a turn at a high velocity."}

One way to measure this is by looking at the earnings, which shows how much profit the company is making. The other options, such as assets, cafeteria, and board of directors, do not provide any relevant information about the company's financial performance."}

In this case, the answer option \"form opinions\" is most likely because when people are presented with controversial information, they will likely think critically about it, weigh their options, and come to their own conclusions about the topic. The other answer options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are unlikely responses to hearing something controversial."}

Out of the choices given, school band is the most likely option for this scenario. An orchestra typically does not perform in a school cafeteria, a brass quartet is a smaller group than a school band, and marching band usually performs outside. School play is not a likely option as it involves acting, not music."}

While some people may have different motivations or intentions for engaging in sexual activity, the option that most people hope to achieve when having sex is typically an orgasm. This is because an orgasm can provide feelings of pleasure and release, and is often considered the physiological endpoint of sexual activity. The other options are generally undesirable outcomes of having sex."}

The choice \"travel\" is the most relevant option because people most often purchase souvenirs when they are traveling and have the opportunity to visit new or interesting places. The other options (\"having money,\" \"money and time,\" \"funeral,\" and \"spending money\") do not relate to the context of the question and offer no indication about when people typically buy souvenirs."}

The options \"forest canopy,\" \"large trees,\" and \"tropical rainforest\" are all related to trees, which sloths are known to climb. \"Nature preserve\" doesn't provide any insight into where a sloth can climb, and \"universe\" is clearly unrelated to the context of the sentence."}

The correct answer should reflect a positive outcome, as learning about science is typically seen as a valuable and exciting pursuit. The option \"loss of interest\" is unlikely to be correct because it suggests a negative outcome, which is not typical when someone is learning about science. The option \"excitement\" is a likely correct answer because it reflects an outcome that many people experience when learning about science. The options \"accidents\" and \"experiment\" are less likely to be correct because they are specific activities that may occur during the process of learning about science, but they do not reflect the overall outcome of the process."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, except for Texas which is a state in the southern U.S. but that does not necessarily mean that a steak house in Texas serves Dos Equis."}

This is commonly referred to as a stumble. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - committing a sin, failing or disobeying do not seem relevant to the situation described, and a \"boo boo\" is too informal and childish to be used in this context."}

The other options are not related to the context of the sentence, and there is no indication that anything else happened to the person after taking the ibuprofen."}

Beavers are semi-aquatic animals that are often found near rivers and streams, so this further supports the idea that Montana is the state in question. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The phrase \"loving couple\" implies a healthy, supportive relationship between the parents, which can often lead to a happier child. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive relationship between the parents or even any parental involvement at all (e.g. \"act of sex\")."}

Anger is a common response to feeling frustrated or powerless in the face of economic pressures. The other options, such as change in leadership or heartache, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

She didn't care about making friends or gorging on alcohol, she just wanted to do what?"}}, "k": "have fun\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is not concerned with making friends or drinking excessively, indicating that her main goal for attending the party is to enjoy herself. The phrase \"have fun\" is a broad, general statement that encompasses various activities one might engage in while at a party, such as dancing, socializing, or playing games. The other options either do not align with Jane's stated priorities, or are too specific or limited to fully encapsulate the breadth of what she might do at the party."}

Buying Christmas presents was stressful for him, and finishing was whaat?"}}, "k": "relief\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John finds buying Christmas presents stressful, which implies that he would feel relieved once the task is done.

Only smoking has a clear correlation with negative health effects. The other options may be enjoyable or even beneficial for one's health, but they do not have a direct negative impact like smoking does."}

The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence or do not convey the contrast between natural and man-made environments."}

The other options, such as drunkenness or herpes, are not necessarily related to the act of kissing itself and may be considered incorrect or inappropriate responses."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "456d296bbbcca6739a946853ddbcd1c8", "question": {"question_concept": "gaining more land", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "go to war"}, {"label": "B", "text": "higher taxes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "heart attack"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pride"}, {"label": "E", "text": "disputes"}], "stem": "My chest is swelling at the prospect of gaining more land. Why is my chest swelling?"}}, "k": "pride\nKnowledge: The phrase \"chest swelling\" is often used metaphorically to describe pride or an increase in confidence. The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is experiencing a sense of excitement or satisfaction at the idea of gaining more land, which is consistent with feelings of pride. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Frequent hand washing can strip the skin of natural oils and moisture, leading to dryness and irritation. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the potential negative effects of excessive hand washing."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "730e83c1f7c7f1f4a38e12648d7afd8c", "question": {"question_concept": "bowl", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "cupboard"}, {"label": "B", "text": "restaurant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "cabinet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "trash"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dishwasher"}], "stem": "Where do you put a bowl after it is used?"}}, "k": "cupboard\nKnowledge: After a bowl is used, it is typically washed and then put away for future use. A cupboard or cabinet is the most common place to store dishes, including bowls, in a household. A restaurant may have a different system for storing dishes, such as a commercial dishwasher, but this would not be applicable to a general household setting. The trash and dishwasher options do not make sense as places to put a bowl after it is used."}

The other options do not accurately describe the mood of chatting with friends. Love may be present in some friendships but it's not a defining mood for chatting. Social bonding can occur while chatting but it does not describe the overall mood. Talkative may describe the behavior of some people in a chat but not necessarily the mood, and gathering of information is not typically the primary focus of chatting with friends."}

While it is possible that a history of a kingdom could be found in other places such as museums or archives, a book would be the most likely primary source for such information. The other options lack any clear association with the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "2b6324d997da8e0d9dfcedbcc295e37d", "question": {"question_concept": "expressway", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "michigan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "large city"}, {"label": "C", "text": "state"}, {"label": "D", "text": "american city"}, {"label": "E", "text": "eastern united states"}], "stem": "If you're in North America traveling an expressway toward the Atlantic Ocean, where are you traveling to?"}}, "k": "Eastern United States\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the location being traveled to is on the Atlantic Ocean and on an expressway in North America. This limits the answer choices to locations on the east coast of the United States. Michigan is not on the east coast and is therefore an incorrect choice. \"Large city\" and \"American city\" do not provide any specific location information. \"State\" is too broad of a category and does not indicate a specific location. \"Eastern United States\" is the correct choice as it accurately describes the region where the Atlantic Ocean and expressways intersect."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "1f1dac89f40a1d3bcb54b16398857639", "question": {"question_concept": "perform", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "standing ovation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "music"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tricks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "applause"}, {"label": "E", "text": "smile"}], "stem": "What do people perform if they have a band?"}}, "k": "music\nKnowledge: The question is asking about what people might perform if they have a band. A band typically refers to a group of musicians who perform music together. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be music, as that is the primary activity associated with being in a band. The other options (standing ovation, tricks, applause, smile) do not make sense in this context."}

In this context, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth and extends to outer space. Therefore, someone going \"to the sky\" would have to pass through the atmosphere to reach their destination. The other options are not related to the concept of moving upwards into the sky."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "616c8f60c2611e3f08ddfa58f3792306", "question": {"question_concept": "food", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "space shuttle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "friend's house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "disneyland"}, {"label": "D", "text": "supermarket"}, {"label": "E", "text": "gas station"}], "stem": "Billy was was going on a long vacation, but before he did he got a bite to eat.  Where might he have eaten?"}}, "k": "friend's house\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy went to get a bite to eat before going on a long vacation. It is unlikely that he would eat at a space shuttle or Disneyland as these are not common places for people to grab a quick meal. Supermarkets and gas stations may have food options, but they are not typically places where people would eat before going on a long vacation. Therefore, the most likely choice is that he ate at a friend's house, as this is a common location for a meal before leaving on a trip."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "70cc2bcb4204bc60d5f0aeacdb31bf1e", "question": {"question_concept": "tourniquet", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "hospital"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ambulance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pocket"}, {"label": "D", "text": "emergency kit"}, {"label": "E", "text": "applying even pressure"}], "stem": "where do you keep a tourniquet?"}}, "k": "emergency kit\nKnowledge: A tourniquet is a medical tool used to stop bleeding, typically in emergency situations. It is often recommended to keep a tourniquet in an emergency kit or first aid kit for easy access in case of an injury. Keeping a tourniquet in a hospital or ambulance would not be practical for most people, and applying even pressure would not be effective in all situations. Pocket is not a completely wrong option, but it implies that an individual should carry a tourniquet on their person, which is not the norm."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "0577abb9eecb50a74ee9dbb7c5544c8c", "question": {"question_concept": "getting warm", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "jump in a swimming pool"}, {"label": "B", "text": "starting fire"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pleasure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "increase of temperature"}, {"label": "E", "text": "feeling comfortable"}], "stem": "I'm naked in the snow.  I need some method of getting warm.  What mightI try?"}}, "k": "increase of temperature\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is experiencing cold weather and needs to find a way to warm up. Starting a fire or increasing the temperature are both logical choices for achieving this goal. Jumping in a swimming pool would likely only make the situation worse, and pleasure and feeling comfortable are not methods for getting warm."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "de29f7e8be9d98a1e3013c9cb1597fde", "question": {"question_concept": "bread", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "refrigerator"}, {"label": "B", "text": "dinner"}, {"label": "C", "text": "jail"}, {"label": "D", "text": "supermarket"}, {"label": "E", "text": "going on a date"}], "stem": "When is good time for garlic bread?"}}, "k": "dinner\nKnowledge: Garlic bread is a popular side dish served during meals, particularly dinner. It is typically served warm alongside pasta, soup, or other main courses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This may include letters, emails, memos, reports, and other types of written communication. Listening, carpal tunnel syndrome, revolutions, and writer's cramp are not related to the act of writing as a form of communication."}

The other choices may be motivating factors for why people get up and live life, but they do not explain the sense of obligation conveyed by the sentence. \"Have no other choice\" aligns with the sentiment that people feel compelled to live their lives, regardless of their personal circumstances."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "438910721e910bfce138e84511a33649", "question": {"question_concept": "newspapers", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "tree"}, {"label": "B", "text": "recycled"}, {"label": "C", "text": "written on paper"}, {"label": "D", "text": "printed on paper"}, {"label": "E", "text": "local"}], "stem": "The big rolling machines made tons of newspapers everyday simply by getting the stories what?"}}, "k": "printed on paper\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the big rolling machines are involved in the production of newspapers by processing the stories. This implies that the newspapers are printed on paper, which is the option that best relates to the context of the sentence. The other options - tree, recycled, written on paper, and local - do not fit the context as well as printed on paper."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "5ade3aabdfcc3cf80d83615d693885ee", "question": {"question_concept": "disability", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "activity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "potence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "qualification"}, {"label": "D", "text": "competency"}, {"label": "E", "text": "strength"}], "stem": "Billy's disability prevented him from moving, but it didn't alter his mind or what?"}}, "k": "mind\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy's disability only affected his ability to move, but not his mental faculties. The choices \"activity,\" \"potence,\" \"qualification,\" \"competency,\" and \"strength\" all refer to physical abilities or attributes, so they do not fit the context of the sentence."}

The phrase \"got the best of her\" implies that her curiosity was strong and overpowering, which further reinforces the idea that she wanted to investigate the product in more detail. The option to \"purchase it\" would not necessarily satisfy her curiosity, while the options to \"attend school\" or \"go to market\" are not relevant to the context of the sentence. The option to \"hear news\" is too vague and does not provide enough information to make a clear choice."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "cf02f308a8eea94adf2d55bf7e1b1f45", "question": {"question_concept": "hurting else", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "legal problems"}, {"label": "B", "text": "more hurt"}, {"label": "C", "text": "physical pain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "public outcry"}, {"label": "E", "text": "money"}], "stem": "If you're caught hurting someone else, what are you likely to have?"}}, "k": "legal problems\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the consequences of \"hurting someone else\" are being discussed. In this case, legal problems would be the most likely consequence, as it is against the law to harm another person. The other options do not make logical sense in this context - \"more hurt\" and \"physical pain\" suggest that the person who caused the harm would be the one experiencing pain, which is not specified in the sentence. \"Public outcry\" may be a consequence of a high-profile incident, but it does not necessarily imply any legal action. \"Money\" may come into play if there is a lawsuit, but it is not a direct consequence of hurting someone else."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "8aa236cf3fad03ca30d16eab9dbe5552", "question": {"question_concept": "cloud", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "clear sky"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat cake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sunny"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bringing rain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sunshine"}], "stem": "There was a cloud or two out but overall it was very what?"}}, "k": "sunny\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that despite a few clouds in the sky, the overall weather is still pleasant. \"Sunny\" is an appropriate choice for this because it indicates that the sun is shining brightly, which is often associated with good weather. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. \"Clear sky\" and \"sunshine\" are both related to good weather, but they do not account for the presence of a few clouds. \"Bring rain\" is the opposite of good weather, and \"eat cake\" is unrelated."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "ce99bfa8369e019a5085d2dd68c4be8e", "question": {"question_concept": "puzzle", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "playground"}, {"label": "B", "text": "newspaper"}, {"label": "C", "text": "kindergarten class"}, {"label": "D", "text": "toy store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "toy shop"}], "stem": "If I wanted to work a crossword puzzle, where might I find one?"}}, "k": "newspaper\nKnowledge: Crossword puzzles are commonly found in newspapers as a form of entertainment and mental exercise for readers.

The word \"arts\" is a commonly used term to refer to the \"associates of something else\" degree, while the other options do not fit this context. Additionally, an associates of arts degree is a common option for students who are interested in pursuing careers in fields like education, humanities, or social sciences."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "fd5faa7591f5990609d3f8b6595a8541", "question": {"question_concept": "fish", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "striped"}, {"label": "B", "text": "colorful"}, {"label": "C", "text": "gills"}, {"label": "D", "text": "snakefish"}, {"label": "E", "text": "eaten raw"}], "stem": "Fish comes in all varieties, many people prefer the ones than can be what?"}}, "k": "eaten raw\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there are different types of fish, but the important factor is whether they can be eaten raw. This implies that the answer is related to the concept of sushi, sashimi or other raw fish dishes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "01cd7b4878ce601f5a0180293b2a520b", "question": {"question_concept": "watch film", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "go to movies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rent one"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sit down"}, {"label": "D", "text": "listen"}, {"label": "E", "text": "quite"}], "stem": "He enjoyed to watch film a second time with director's commentary, he loved the insight and would do what intently?"}}, "k": "listen\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys watching a film a second time specifically with the director's commentary, indicating that they are interested in gaining additional insights and perspectives on the film. Therefore, the correct answer is \"listen\", as this indicates an active engagement with the commentary. The other options do not accurately describe the person's behavior or intention."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "017024cafd984c091f3c09fed540afaf", "question": {"question_concept": "writing term paper", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "headaches"}, {"label": "B", "text": "errors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "low mark"}, {"label": "D", "text": "anxiety"}, {"label": "E", "text": "frustration"}], "stem": "What will happen to someone writing a term paper too quickly likely encounter?"}}, "k": "errors\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that writing a term paper too quickly can be detrimental in some way. One possible outcome could be making errors, as rushing through a task can result in overlooking important details and making mistakes. The other options (headaches, low mark, anxiety, frustration) are also possible outcomes of rushing through a term paper, but they do not necessarily imply that errors will be made."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "3e792834df2aa7ae2a9070b494e37c26", "question": {"question_concept": "steam", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "condensate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "electric smoke"}, {"label": "C", "text": "smoke"}, {"label": "D", "text": "liquid water"}, {"label": "E", "text": "cold air"}], "stem": "John cooled the steam. What did the steam become?"}}, "k": "condensate\nKnowledge: When steam is cooled down, it loses its heat energy and begins to condense into water droplets. This process is called condensation and the resulting liquid is called condensate. The other options do not accurately describe what happens to steam when it is cooled down. Electric smoke and smoke are not related to steam, liquid water suggests that the steam completely disappears, and cold air is not a result of steam cooling down."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "03587acf08013444ce90fb2096bd9de8", "question": {"question_concept": "surface", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "mirror"}, {"label": "B", "text": "object"}, {"label": "C", "text": "cottage cheese"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tetrahedron"}, {"label": "E", "text": "lake"}], "stem": "What has a surface with ripples?"}}, "k": "lake\nKnowledge: The word \"ripples\" suggests that the object being described has a surface that is uneven or wavy. A mirror, object, and tetrahedron do not typically have this characteristic surface. Cottage cheese is a food item and not an object with a surface. Therefore, the correct answer must be \"lake,\" as lakes have surfaces that can be rippled by wind or movement."}

Under the bed is not a common storage place for board games, and a toy store would not be a logical answer as this would suggest that the group had to go out and purchase the board game before playing it. House is too broad a term and doesn't provide any specific location within the house."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "28ab300ef821e57e19be3f757842dd62", "question": {"question_concept": "seating", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rest area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bus depot"}, {"label": "C", "text": "theatre"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bus stop"}, {"label": "E", "text": "church"}], "stem": "Where might I find seating while waiting to take public transit in a major city?"}}, "k": "bus stop\nKnowledge: A bus stop is a designated area where public transportation vehicles stop to pick up and drop off passengers. It is common for bus stops to have seating options for passengers who are waiting for their bus to arrive. Rest areas, theatres, and churches are not typically locations where public transportation is available. A bus depot is a transportation hub where buses are parked and maintained, but it is not a place where passengers typically wait for their bus."}

These homes were often built with a peaked roof, which allowed for the creation of an attic space. Victorian houses, which were built in the late 19th century, are a specific example of older homes that often have attics. The other options, such as boxes and apartments, do not typically have attics."}

However, \"determination\" is often cited as a crucial quality for entrepreneurs because starting a business is frequently difficult and requires the ability to persevere through setbacks and obstacles."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "f1b2a30a1facff543e055231c5f90dd0", "question": {"question_concept": "going public", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "consequences"}, {"label": "B", "text": "being ridiculed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "more money"}, {"label": "D", "text": "more funding"}, {"label": "E", "text": "telling all"}], "stem": "What would someone need to do if he or she wanted to be going public?"}}, "k": "more funding\nKnowledge: Going public typically refers to a company's initial public offering (IPO), in which they offer shares of their stock to the general public for the first time. To do this, they need to have enough funds to cover the costs associated with the IPO, such as legal fees and underwriting fees. Therefore, someone who wants to go public would likely need to secure more funding in order to cover these costs. The other choices are not necessarily related to the process of going public."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "a63b4d0c0b34d6e5f5ce7b2c2c08b825", "question": {"question_concept": "chair", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "stadium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "kitchen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "porch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "cubicle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "living room"}], "stem": "Where might you find a chair at an office?"}}, "k": "cubicle\nKnowledge: The sentence states that a chair might be found at an office, which is a place of work where people typically sit at desks or workstations. The only option that is related to a workspace is a cubicle, which is a type of office space that is enclosed on three sides and often contains a desk and chair. The other options (stadium, kitchen, porch, living room) do not have any connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "22d0eea15e10be56024fd00bb0e4f72f", "question": {"question_concept": "jeans", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "shopping mall"}, {"label": "B", "text": "laundromat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hospital"}, {"label": "D", "text": "clothing store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "thrift store"}], "stem": "Where would you buy jeans in a place with a large number of indoor merchants?"}}, "k": "shopping mall\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the place has a large number of indoor merchants, which is a characteristic commonly associated with shopping malls. Shopping malls typically have a variety of clothing stores, including stores that specialize in selling jeans. The other options, such as laundromats and hospitals, are unlikely to have a large number of indoor merchants selling jeans. Thrift stores may have a variety of clothing options, but they are typically not located in areas with a large concentration of indoor merchants."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "7c55160a4630de9690eb328b57a18dc2", "question": {"question_concept": "well", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fairytale"}, {"label": "B", "text": "farm yard"}, {"label": "C", "text": "farm country"}, {"label": "D", "text": "michigan"}, {"label": "E", "text": "horror movie"}], "stem": "John fell down the well.  he couldn't believe what he found down there. It was like something out of what?"}}, "k": "fairytale\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John found something unexpected and fantastical in the well, which is a common feature of fairytales. Fairytales often involve magical creatures, enchanted objects or mysterious settings that are beyond the realm of the ordinary world. The other choices do not fit with the context of the sentence - a farm yard or farm country would not likely contain fantastical elements, Michigan is a state and therefore cannot be like \"something out of\", and a horror movie would suggest a scary or gruesome discovery, which is not implied by the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "dd640927f9920930501fb8dc3efc196b", "question": {"question_concept": "electricity", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "put in to the water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cause fire"}, {"label": "C", "text": "produce heat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "short fuse"}, {"label": "E", "text": "shock"}], "stem": "I forgot to pay the electricity bill, now what can't I do with my ground pump?"}}, "k": "put in to the water\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unable to do something specific with their ground pump because they forgot to pay the electricity bill. The options all relate to the potential risks of electricity, but only \"put in to the water\" suggests a limitation on the use of the ground pump due to a lack of electricity. It is likely that the ground pump requires electricity to function, and without it, the person cannot pump water from a source into their property. The other options, such as \"cause fire\" and \"shock,\" are possible consequences of faulty electrical equipment, but they do not relate directly to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "366a0cde2e24373fae7b17ab37a6d1f6", "question": {"question_concept": "elephant", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "india"}, {"label": "B", "text": "circus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "zoo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "safari"}, {"label": "E", "text": "africa"}], "stem": "Where can we see an elephant do tricks?"}}, "k": "circus\nKnowledge: The word \"tricks\" suggests that the elephant is trained to perform for entertainment purposes, which is commonly seen in circuses. Zoos may have elephants on display, but they typically do not train them to perform tricks. Safaris and Africa may have wild elephants, but it is unlikely that they would be performing tricks for an audience. India is known for its elephants, but it is not a clear indicator of where an elephant would be performing tricks."}
