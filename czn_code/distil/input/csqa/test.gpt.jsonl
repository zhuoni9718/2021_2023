The rotating mechanism helps regulate the flow of people in and out of the building, reducing the likelihood of a rush or a stampede. Additionally, the design of the doors can help prevent unauthorized access or escape by limiting the amount of space available to pass through at any one time. The other options may also use revolving doors, but they do not have the same security implications as a bank."}

Learning from each other and talking to each other may also happen at work, but they are not the primary goals. Killing animals and wearing hats are not typically associated with work unless it is a specific job requirement (such as in the case of a hunter or a hat salesperson)."}

They are often visited by people looking for something to read or to purchase as a gift. Doctors' offices may have magazines and other printed material available for patients, but it is unlikely that they will have many other types of printed works for sale. Markets and train stations may have newsstands, but these typically only sell newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals.

Additionally, the options \"ground up dead cows\" and \"cow carcass\" may be considered inappropriate or offensive responses."}

The other options might be helpful in a different context, but they don't necessarily relate specifically to looking for farmland. The midwest has many farming areas, but it is too broad to give a specific suggestion. The countryside and estate options could imply that James is looking for a specific type of property, but they don't necessarily indicate that those areas have farmland. Illinois may have farming areas, but it could also have other types of land that wouldn't meet James' needs."}

Listening to each other is a common tactic among animals, allowing them to communicate and coordinate their responses in the face of danger. The other options do not make sense in this context - feeling pleasure, procreating, and passing water are unrelated to responding to an enemy, while singing is only used by a few species of animals and is not typically associated with a response to danger."}

While singing may also be part of playing guitar, it is not always the case. Similarly, while hearing sounds is a necessary part of playing guitar, it is not a unique characteristic of guitar playing. Arthritis is a medical condition that may affect someone's ability to play guitar, but it is not something that people typically do while playing guitar. Crying is also not typically associated with playing guitar, although it is possible that someone may cry while playing if the music evokes strong emotions."}

Of the given choices, only \"lots of attention\" fits this criteria as dogs require social interaction and companionship. The other choices, such as bone or charm, may be nice for a dog to have but do not fulfill an essential need like attention does. \"Petted\" may also be a nice-to-have, but it is not a requirement for a dog's well-being. \"Walked\" is important for a dog's physical health, but is not the only thing a dog needs besides water and nourishment."}

The other options, such as erection and fear, seem inappropriate and do not align with the context of the sentence. Laughter could be a reason for watching a film, but it is not the only one and the sentence does not explicitly suggest it. Bordem is also not specifically mentioned in the sentence and seems like an unlikely reason for someone to watch a movie."}

In a reception area, this would typically mean waiting with other people who are also waiting to be seen or served. The other options, such as motels, chairs, hospitals, and hotels, do not fit the context of waiting alongside something."}

The other options are either nonsensical, dangerous, or unrelated to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "6dc5b2884737e66543ce65f8dc40c992", "question": {"question_concept": "fencing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "injury"}, {"label": "B", "text": "small cuts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fever"}, {"label": "D", "text": "competition"}, {"label": "E", "text": "puncture wound"}], "stem": "A fencing thrust with a sharp sword towards a person would result in what?"}}, "k": "puncture wound\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions a fencing thrust with a sharp sword, which implies an intentional and forceful action. Injuries and small cuts are too general and do not specifically relate to the action described. Fever and competition are unrelated to the context of the sentence. A puncture wound is a more specific and accurate outcome of a fencing thrust with a sharp sword."}

The phrase \"unlike a spider and his many sightseers\" suggests that spiders have many eyes to sightsee with, while people do not. This narrows down the possible answers to either \"brains\" or \"two eyes.\" However, the second part of the sentence clarifies that people do have a visual sense, which means the correct answer is \"two eyes.\" The other options are irrelevant or incorrect based on the given context."}

The options \"classroom\", \"at school\", and \"desk drawer\" may suggest a more academic setting, but the use of the word \"adults\" rules out these choices. \"Kitchen drawer\" may suggest a household setting, but again, the context of the question implies a workplace environment. Therefore, \"office\" is the most logical and likely answer."}

The most logical answer is therefore \"floor,\" as flooring is commonly installed on top of wood subfloors. The other options do not relate to this context - a lumberyard sells wood products rather than things that go on top of wood, a synagogue is a place of worship and not related to wood, carpet is typically placed over a subfloor rather than on top of wood, and a hardware store may sell items that can be used in conjunction with wood but not necessarily on top of it."}

The word \"pondering\" implies that he was thinking deeply about something. The fact that he started painting implies that he was struck by an idea or inspiration. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. For example, sadness, anxiety, and discomfort would be more likely to inhibit creativity than inspire it. Insights are a little more ambiguous, but the sentence doesn't suggest that the artist was actively seeking understanding or knowledge at the time."}

The word \"nearly\" suggests that the film is not completely indestructible, but very close to it. The other options, such as \"durable\" and \"unbreakable,\" suggest strength but not necessarily to the same extreme degree as \"indestructible.\""}

Apartments, on the other hand, often have private facilities that are only available to residents or their guests, which could explain why this type of toilet might be found in an apartment."}

The word 'stupid' directly conveys this meaning. The other options may have some overlapping connotations, but they do not accurately capture the full meaning conveyed in the sentence."}

The correct term for the young that are born as a result of reproduction is offspring. The other options are not accurate or appropriate in the context of reproduction in wildlife."}

A barn is a common place to keep chickens and their eggs, which makes it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices (entertained, understanding, hunger, tired eyes) do not relate to the goal of expanding one's perspective through reading."}

The word \"vocation\" specifically refers to a person's career or profession, making it the most appropriate answer. \"New job\" is too broad and general, while \"Michigan\" and \"manual\" do not make sense in this context. \"Working hard\" is a characteristic that may lead to success but does not directly answer the question."}

Committing perjury can result in legal consequences such as indictment or imprisonment, but the most appropriate choice to complete the sentence would be \"crime,\" since it accurately reflects the severity of the offense. \"Violence\" would not be an appropriate choice as perjury is not a violent act, and \"lie\" and \"go to jail\" are too specific or simplistic to capture the seriousness of the offense."}

The word \"hasten\" means to hurry or accelerate, making it the most appropriate choice for this context. The other options (\"eat,\" \"antedate,\" \"bring forward,\" and \"advance\") do not have any clear correlation with the idea of completing work on time."}

Where might he look for one?"}}, "k": "subway station\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James is looking for an old underground map from the 50s, which is likely to be related to the subway system. Therefore, the most logical option would be the subway station where the map would have been used. The library, county engineer's office, and super market are unlikely to have such specific maps, and there is no context to suggest that James might find the map at home."}

The most logical option is to slow down, as this is a common response to a yellow traffic light. The other options, such as taking time or dawdling, do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. The inclusion of \"ocean\" as a choice is also irrelevant and does not make sense in the given sentence."}

The ignition switch is the part of the car that starts the engine and would therefore be the logical target for the thief. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide any indication of what the thief may have been trying to access."}

The other options are not appropriate for storing perishable food items like cake. Quandry refers to a state of uncertainty, oven is used for baking and night stand is a piece of furniture, while bakery is a place where cakes are made and sold, not stored."}

A whirlpool bath is a type of bathtub that has water jets that circulate the water, creating a swirling motion similar to a whirlpool. This makes it an ideal choice for someone who wants to submerge themselves in water. The other options do not offer a viable option for submerging oneself in water."}

The purpose of a doormat is to trap dirt and debris from shoes before entering the building, and this is most effective when placed directly in front of the entry point. While a doormat could technically be placed in some of the other options listed, such as an entrance porch or hallway, it is most commonly associated with the front door."}

Where does he probably live?"}}, "k": "tropical rainforest\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Bob the lizard lives in a warm place with lots of water. The answer choice that best fits this description is a tropical rainforest, which is known for high temperatures, high humidity, and abundant rainfall. The other options, such as rock and rocky places, do not necessarily suggest a warm place or lots of water. New Mexico, while warm, is known for arid desert landscapes rather than plentiful water.

What did he need money to do?"}}, "k": "pay bills\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that August was in danger of losing his house, which could happen if he was unable to pay his bills. Therefore, the correct answer is \"pay bills.\" The other options do not relate to August's financial struggle or the consequences of not having enough money to pay for basic needs like housing."}

Consulting a manual is a common way to obtain specific instructions for repairing or operating a device. The other options, such as chickens, google, newspaper, and online, do not have any clear connection to obtaining specific information for repairing a machine."}

The option \"table\" makes the most sense as it is a flat surface where a picture frame can be placed horizontally. The other options do not provide a clear surface for placing a picture frame horizontally, such as an art show, wall, newspaper, and car."}

He didn't even get paid for it.  Why was this bad?"}}, "k": "broken law\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that James was engaging in an illegal activity, which was buying beer for minors. Buying alcohol for individuals under the legal drinking age is a crime, and individuals who are caught engaging in such activities can be subject to fines, jail time, or other legal consequences. The other options do not provide any information that directly relates to the illegal nature of James' actions."}

The other options are not common or desirable results of applying for a job. Anxiety and fear may be associated with the job interview process, but the ultimate goal is still to obtain employment. Increased workload may come after being employed, but it is not a direct result of applying. Praise and less sleep are also unlikely results of simply applying for a job."}

Since the other options involve already having money or bringing cash with you, it can be inferred that the correct answer involves obtaining the money needed to make purchases. This is a common step that most people take before going shopping, as it is difficult to make purchases without any funds."}

What did he need to bring to work?"}}, "k": "violin case\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John's role as first violin in a symphony orchestra requires him to bring something specific to work every day. Given that he is a violinist, it makes sense that he would need to bring his instrument with him in a protective case. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence."}

Additionally, the use of a telephone book further supports the idea that the place may be a telephone booth, which is a small enclosure designed for making phone calls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is a pet shop. The other options do not make sense in this context. A fish market or fishmonger may sell crabs for consumption, but they would not be excited about the crab as a pet. The intertidal zone is a location where crabs may be found, but it is not a person or group of people who would be excited about a crab. Obesity is not related to the question."}

Of the given choices, only a dress shop would likely carry clothing options that do not include pants. The other options are either unrelated or do not offer any indication that they would carry non-pant clothing options."}

This is commonly associated with slurred speech, where the words become unclear and difficult to understand. A seizure and death are unlikely outcomes of getting drunk, and forgetfulness and passing out do not specifically relate to communication difficulties."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "e953dee48c70159ad879143a319ec607", "question": {"question_concept": "beginning work", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "accomplishing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "working"}, {"label": "D", "text": "momentum"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tiredness"}], "stem": "When a person is beginning work, what are they building?"}}, "k": "momentum\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is just starting work, which implies that they are trying to get themselves into a productive state of mind. Building momentum refers to the process of gathering energy and motivation to get started on a task, which is likely to be the person's goal. Time and tiredness are not things that a person can \"build,\" and \"working\" and \"accomplishing\" do not convey the same sense of starting out or gathering energy."}

Playing tag is a common childhood game that involves running around and chasing after others, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options are either dangerous or do not have any clear connection to the idea of playing."}

This is a common experience for many people, and can often lead to feelings of frustration, boredom, or even annoyance. The other options do not necessarily relate to the idea of getting tired of something or someone."}

The other options (movie theatre, bowling alley, factory, store) are unlikely to be places where a test would be administered, and therefore can be eliminated as choices. Additionally, the use of the word \"teacher\" further supports the conclusion that the correct answer is \"classroom.\""}

This eliminates options such as California, big town, and Florida, which are all known for their busy highways and urban development. \"Countryside\" is the most fitting option, as it implies a location outside of a major city or suburban area. \"America\" is too broad to be the correct answer, as it does not provide any specific details about the location of the freeway."}

Watching television and going to the cinema are activities that can be done alone or with a large group, while going to a fairground may be too crowded or overwhelming for a small group. \"Good\" is not a viable answer option as it is not a location or activity. Going to a friend's house is a common choice for a small group outing as it provides a comfortable and intimate setting for socializing and having fun with friends."}

Therefore, it is important to consider the context and personal interests of the individual when choosing an answer to this question."}

The options \"hell\" and \"school\" are unlikely locations for using a personal computer, while \"internet cafe\" suggests that the user is accessing a shared computer. \"Indoors\" could be a possibility, but it is too broad to make a definitive choice. Therefore, \"house\" is the best option as it specifically refers to a location where someone would have their own personal computer."}

The other options, such as tree or in a jar, do not make sense in the context of the question. Snakes can also be found in tropical forests, but the question specifically mentions tall grass, which is a common feature of fields. Pet shops are also an irrelevant option as they usually do not keep snakes in tall grass."}

A state park is a protected area of land that is often known for its natural beauty and includes features like trees, trails, and benches for visitors to rest and enjoy the environment. The other options do not have a clear association with benches in a natural setting."}

The description of the opponent as \"confident\" implies that they are skilled or experienced in some way, giving the subject reason to believe that the fight will be harder than they initially anticipated. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence or offer any insight into the subject's thoughts or feelings."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a bathtub may require multiple curtains or none at all, a washing area may not require a curtain, a hotel may have different styles of bathrooms, and a department store does not use shower curtains for their intended purpose."}

A house is a common place where fires can occur, especially in the kitchen, so having a fire extinguisher nearby can be helpful in case of emergency. The other options may also be places where fires can occur, but they may have special regulations or requirements for fire safety equipment. A school bus or boat, for example, may have their own fire suppression systems already in place, and hospitals and schools may have specific fire safety protocols that go beyond just having a fire extinguisher."}

Additionally, Edinburgh is a city in Scotland known for its historic castle, while fairy tale is a genre and not a geographic location. Antarctica is mostly uninhabitable and unlikely to have castles. This leaves Germany and Europe as the remaining choices, but Germany is just one country within Europe and may not have the most castles overall. Therefore, the correct answer is Europe."}

The word \"bored\" is also a common descriptor for this type of situation, as it implies a lack of engagement or enjoyment. The other answer choices are either irrelevant to the context of the question (e.g. \"have time\" or \"learn new\") or are the opposite of the expected outcome (e.g. \"enjoyable\")."}

This eliminates the option \"gone,\" which suggests that the basketball no longer exists or has lost its shape entirely. The other options all have to do with characteristics of a basketball: it can be \"punctured\" by something sharp, it is \"full of air\" to maintain its round shape, and it is \"popular in America\" as it is a common sport in the country. The option \"round\" is also a characteristic of a basketball as it is a spherical object."}

Irritability and discomfort may contribute to the problem but they are not the likely cause given the context of the sentence. Depression and happiness are not related to the sentence."}

The countryside may offer habitat for some species of wild birds, but the most common and natural habitat for a wild bird is the sky, where they are free to fly and roam. Therefore, the correct answer is \"sky.\""}

Harry said that he could have always made a different what?"}}, "k": "choice\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests a contrast between John's belief in fate and Harry's belief in an alternative option. The word \"different\" also suggests that Harry believed John could have chosen an alternative course of action, indicating the importance of choices. Therefore, \"choice\" is the correct answer. The other options, such as \"free will,\" \"will,\" \"alcohol,\" and \"freedom\" do not directly relate to the context of the sentence."}

The act of taking another person's life can have long-lasting psychological effects, including feelings of guilt and remorse. Therefore, it is likely that committing murder would prevent someone from having a clear conscience or feeling at peace with themselves. The other options are not necessarily directly related to murder and do not make sense in the context of the question."}

His socks were smelly and his soles were blistered, but that didn't matter.  He could still do what?"}}, "k": "walk\nKnowledge: The sentence explicitly states that George didn't have a car but still had his two feet, implying that he could move from place to place by walking. The description of his smelly socks and blistered soles further suggests that he uses his feet a lot. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The other options- abaft, ship, winch, and building- do not provide any clear indication of a context where a crane would require the use of steel cables."}

The options given all relate to farming in some way, but only \"supply food\" directly speaks to the purpose of farming. While raising cattle, growing corn, and farming land are all aspects of the farming process, their main goal is to produce food for consumption. Driving tractors is a part of the process but not the main purpose of being a farmer."}

The other options are not typically used for saving coins or small amounts of money, and may not be secure or convenient for this purpose. A wallet is used to hold paper money and credit cards, while a toy, ground, or pocket do not offer any protection or organization for coins."}

The only option that relates to cooking is the stew pot. The other options, such as the wharf or tidepools, may be places where crab meat is obtained, but they do not pertain to the task of cooking uncooked crab meat. The boss's office and Red Lobster are also irrelevant to the question."}

The most likely choice for someone to avoid if they were afraid of illness would be a sick person, as they would be more likely to spread germs or be contagious. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of illness or disease, and would not necessarily be avoided by someone with a fear of illness."}

The options \"cooking\" and \"cook food\" do not make sense in this context, as they refer to the act of using pans rather than storing or transporting them. \"Kitchen\" and \"drawer\" may be places to store pans, but they do not fit the requirement of bringing them with you. \"Backpack\" is the only option that fits the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "0f4159e80f8dbf682819215bbf0f5b5a_1", "question": {"question_concept": "remembering", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "knowledge"}, {"label": "B", "text": "knowing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "forgetful"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pleasure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "depression"}], "stem": "If you're remembering something, it's because of your what of it to begin with?"}}, "k": "knowledge\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering something is a result of having knowledge of it to begin with. This makes sense as memory is often linked to one's ability to retain and recall information that they have learned or experienced. The other answer choices, such as \"forgetful,\" \"pleasure,\" and \"depression,\" do not align with the idea of remembering information based on prior knowledge."}

They planned on going to bed early so that they could spend a long time doing what?"}}, "k": "making love\nKnowledge: The fact that Friday was James's 5th anniversary and that they planned on going to bed early suggests that they may have scheduled some romantic activity for the occasion. \"Making love\" is a common phrase used to refer to sexual activity between romantic partners, so this option is the most likely answer. \"Rest\" and \"sleeping in\" suggest a normal night's sleep, which would not be a special way to celebrate an anniversary. \"Insomnia\" refers to difficulty sleeping, which is the opposite of what James and their partner planned. \"Texting\" is unrelated to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "400fb2e196e71abb70e5b3f9aab4b9ee", "question": {"question_concept": "get drunk", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "health"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fall down"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stagger"}, {"label": "D", "text": "get arrested"}, {"label": "E", "text": "vomit"}], "stem": "The teens were trying to hide that they get drink, but when they walked in the door their what gave it away?"}}, "k": "stagger\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the teens were trying to conceal their consumption of alcohol, but their actions upon entering the door revealed the truth. The option \"stagger\" fits this context as it suggests unsteadiness or swaying, which can be a sign of intoxication. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context and may not apply to the situation described. For example, \"get arrested\" suggests a more extreme outcome that may not have occurred in this case."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "3fb36127a61903029a363911a1d2b1e9_1", "question": {"question_concept": "landing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "ocean"}, {"label": "B", "text": "apartment building"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stairwell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "airport"}, {"label": "E", "text": "room"}], "stem": "You'll find a landing at the top of what?"}}, "k": "stairwell\nKnowledge: The word \"landing\" suggests a space for individuals to step off or onto a set of stairs. This is common in a stairwell, where individuals can stop and rest or change direction. The other options do not have stairs that would require a landing at the top. An ocean, airport, apartment building or room would not have a landing at the top."}

The specific task mentioned in the choices, washing dishes, is commonly associated with entry-level kitchen jobs that do not require extensive experience or training. The other choices, such as forgetting or questioning authority, do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence. The repeated choice, \"oik squeaky hinge,\" is likely a typo and can be disregarded."}

What city might he be in?"}}, "k": "Toronto\nKnowledge: The term \"mountie\" is slang for a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is primarily based in Canada. The reference to a subway stop suggests that the city in question has a subway system. While Chicago and New York City have subway systems, they do not have a large number of Mounties, as this law enforcement agency operates only in Canada. Toronto is a major city in Canada with a subway system and is therefore the most likely answer."}

Why might he do this?"}}, "k": "stress relief\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy is intentionally setting aside time for something enjoyable after work. The most logical reason for this is to alleviate stress and unwind after a long day of work. The other options, such as ocean or laughter, are not directly related to the sentence or to the idea of setting aside specific time for leisure activities. The options happiness and pleasure are related to leisure, but do not necessarily explain why Billy is deliberately making time for fun after work."}

Meanwhile, the ban in the blue had put in effort and was very what?"}}, "k": "productive\nKnowledge: The sentence states that the man in the white suit was lazy and did nothing useful, while the man in the blue put in effort. This suggests that the man in the blue was productive, meaning he accomplished something useful or valuable. The other choices, such as restless or hard work, do not necessarily indicate that the man was productive, but rather may describe his behavior or attitude. Lazybutt is not a commonly used term, and does not fit the tone of the sentence."}

Greed is a desire for excessive wealth or possessions, and someone who is consumed by it may prioritize their own interests over the needs or feelings of others. This can make it difficult to form and maintain friendships, as a strong focus on personal gain can alienate others and make them feel undervalued. The other options may be affected by greed to some extent, but they are not inherently or directly linked to the negative effects of excessive greed."}

The other options, such as a WWII bunker or Las Vegas, do not provide suitable locations for a traveler to stay in a hotel after a long trip. A resort could be a possibility, but the sentence does not offer any clues about the type of destination the traveler was heading to."}

Having an open mind means being willing to consider new ideas and perspectives without judgment or bias. This is important for eliminating preconceived notions, which are pre-existing opinions or beliefs that can limit our understanding of new information. The other options, such as newness or smartness, do not necessarily relate to this idea of open-mindedness and are less relevant to the context of the question."}

The word \"workflow\" also suggests that the sentence is discussing the functionality of computers. Therefore, the correct answer would be something that relates to the functional capabilities of computers. Out of the given options, only \"multitask\" refers to a specific functional capability of computers, which is the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The other options are either not directly related to the sentence or are too basic to be considered a big deal."}

The most extreme reaction listed in the choices is a riot, which implies that people may feel outraged and may resort to violence or protest. The other options do not adequately capture the intensity of the reaction described in the sentence."}

The most likely type of damage would be tearing, since a sharp object could easily cut through fabric. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not describe a negative outcome caused by the sharp object."}

The options \"maine\" and \"boston\" are specific locations, but the other options are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is \"coastal cities,\" which refers to areas along the coast where seafood restaurants are likely to be found and may attract tourists."}

She was interested in learning about what?"}}, "k": "family tree\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that James's niece was asking him about her grandfather, which suggests that she was interested in learning more about her family history.

The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or interest in learning more about family history."}

He marveled the sheer number of them and the size of what?"}}, "k": "night sky\nKnowledge: The sentence describes James looking up and seeing stars twinkling in the \"black yonder,\" which suggests that he is observing the night sky. The other options, such as \"universe\" and \"outer space,\" are too broad and do not accurately reflect what is being described in the sentence. Additionally, the mention of the \"size\" of something further supports the idea that James is observing the night sky, as it is common to marvel at the vastness and seeming infinitude of the stars and galaxies visible in the night sky."}

Exercise provides physical and mental benefits, such as improved stamina and release of endorphins, which can positively impact one's mood and motivation to continue playing. The other options are unlikely to encourage someone to continue playing tennis, as becoming tired and developing tennis elbow are negative consequences, hunger is unrelated, and victory is not always guaranteed."}

It was so relaxing he almost did what despite his efforts?"}}, "k": "fall asleep\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the sound James heard had a calming effect on him, to the point where he almost fell asleep despite his efforts to resist the urge. This implies that the sound had a certain quality or characteristic that commonly induces relaxation, such as a slow and steady rhythm, low volume, or soothing tone. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or contradict the idea of relaxation."}

These stores were typically found in small neighborhoods or downtown commercial areas, rather than in larger shopping malls or commercial buildings. The phrase \"old movie\" and the word \"past\" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the word \"mall\" suggests a larger, more modern shopping location, which is not typically where dime stores were located."}

The living room and cupboard are both places where items are often displayed or regularly used, so they may not be the best location for an unused chess set. Michigan is a state and not a location for storage. A toy store is a place where chess sets can be purchased, but not necessarily stored. An attic is a common location for storing items that are not needed often, but should be kept in a safe and dry place."}

There were many frogs mating in the area, and James didn't want his son to do what to them?"}}, "k": "disturb\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that James is warning his son to be cautious because there are many frogs mating in the area. Therefore, James would not want his son to disturb or interrupt the mating process, as it could potentially harm the frogs or disrupt their reproductive cycle. The other answer choices do not make as much sense in this context."}

It is not likely to be played by a movie doctor, a cat, or in a music store. While it is possible that someone could be playing it in a symphony or orchestra, that is the most likely option because these groups typically include a wide variety of instruments, including those with unique cultural origins."}

The term \"sailors\" is also used in the sentence, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is related to sailing. The other options do not have any clear connection to sailors or sailing."}

Synagogue and fairy tale do not have any clear connection to the context, and while a street corner may provide some cover, it is not as effective as a bus stop or tunnel."}

Owning a large house provides lots of space to have multiple rooms, store belongings, and entertain guests. The other options, such as having a choice, being mentally challenged, owning a house, or being obese, are not directly related or synonymous with having a large house."}

Bookstores, classrooms, and school rooms may sell books, but they are not typically associated with discounted prices. A book may be found on a bedside table, but this does not provide any information about where it can be purchased."}

They bought two tickets to the Falcons vs the Jets even though neither wanted to see the what?"}}, "k": "hockey game\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John and James made a foolish decision by buying tickets to a specific event, and that neither of them wanted to see something related to the event. The context clues point towards a sporting event, as the options include a hockey game and a general \"sporting event.\" The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

Teaching courses is a common responsibility of professors in universities and colleges. The other options either do not relate to the job of a professor (methods of facts, state facts) or are stereotypes that do not necessarily apply to all professors (wear wrinkled tweed jackets). School students could be a possible answer, but it is not specific enough as professors can also work with graduate students, researchers, and other professionals."}

Flower beds are known for containing a variety of colorful blooms, which may explain the comparison to colorful anemones. The other options, such as intertidal zones, coral seas, and under water, do not have any clear connection to flower beds or colorful objects. The Florida Keys may be known for their colorful sea life, but this option does not fit the comparison to an object found in a flower bed."}

While some conspiracy theories may suggest specific locations, such as Roswell, these claims are not proven and do not have broad scientific support. The universe as a whole could technically be considered the origin of all life, but in the context of the question, outer space is the most logical and likely answer. Mars is a planet in our solar system and while it has been explored by humans, there is no evidence to suggest it is a source of alien life.

Sleeping or applying for a job are not relevant to the context of getting ready for work in the morning. \"Just do\" and \"concentrate\" are vague and do not provide a clear answer.

The options \"field,\" \"neighborhood,\" and \"apartment building\" do not fit the description of a large number of homes in one location. The option \"star can\" is not a common or recognizable term. \"City or town\" is the logical choice, as cities and towns typically have large populations and numerous residences."}

This implies that there is a potential for harm, such as physical injury, while participating in the activity.

While some people may have personal movie collections or rent movies from a physical video store, the most common option nowadays is likely to be watching a movie on television. Television sets can display movies either through cable or streaming services, allowing the viewer to access a wide variety of movies without ever leaving their home. The other options, such as a drive-in movie or a live show, would require the person to leave their home to watch the movie."}

The sentence also mentions \"today,\" which suggests that the person was scheduled to appear in court that day. The word \"testify\" specifically refers to giving evidence in a legal setting, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either suggest a different action or are too vague."}

Encouraging children may be something a teacher does throughout the day, but specifically before nap time, telling a story is a common practice to help children relax and transition into a restful state. Lowering expectations and giving a time test would not be appropriate activities before nap time and could actually make children more anxious, while fear is not a positive emotion to associate with a teacher's actions."}

This is typically achieved through regular and consistent practice. Athletes spend countless hours practicing their techniques and strategies to improve their performance.

Comfortable clothes are the most likely choice for someone who wants to jog, as they provide flexibility and breathability while also being durable enough to withstand the rigors of exercise. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence and do not offer any insight into what a person going for a jog might wear."}

This implies that the child didn't have the ability to read the words on the page, making literacy (the ability to read) a necessary factor in being able to read the newspaper. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

It brought her a great deal of what?"}}, "k": "satisfaction\nKnowledge: The sentence states that Jenny enjoyed helping people, which implies that it provided her with a positive feeling or emotion. The most likely emotion associated with helping others is satisfaction or a sense of accomplishment. The other options such as complications and train do not make sense in this context. \"Feel good about yourself\" is a possible option, but satisfaction is a more commonly used phrase to describe this feeling."}

The options \"eat cake,\" \"closet,\" and \"own house\" do not make sense as answers as they are not locations commonly known to have elevators that lead to basements. \"Church\" is also unlikely as typically churches do not have basements accessible by elevator. \"Office building\" is the most likely answer as many modern office buildings have multiple levels and are equipped with elevators to access the different floors, including the basement."}

This is a common way to learn programming, as classes provide structured instruction and support from a teacher. The other options may not provide the same level of guidance or instruction, or may not be relevant to the context of learning programming from someone else."}

The options \"body of animal\" and \"body of dog\" do not make sense in this context as it is unlikely that a person would be trying to build muscle on an animal's body. \"Arm\" is a body part that the person may be focusing on, but it only refers to a specific area and not the whole body. \"Bodybuilder\" is a term used to describe someone who actively participates in bodybuilding competitions, but it does not answer the question of what is being built. Therefore, \"human body\" is the most appropriate answer."}

The word \"fishing\" is also associated with leisure activities and outdoor recreation, which suggests that the man is seeking relaxation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: \"food\" does not explain why the man is skipping work, \"killing\" is not an appropriate reason for skipping work, \"missing morning cartoons\" is unrelated, and \"boredom\" suggests a lack of engagement with work rather than a deliberate choice to skip it."}

The fact that he \"tried to reply\" suggests that he wants to participate in the conversation, but is having trouble doing so.

Military bases often have runways that are designed to accommodate large aircraft and may have additional security measures in place, which could explain why the specialized runway is located at a military base. The other options, such as a back yard or bowling alley, are unlikely to have a suitable runway for an extremely large cargo plane to land."}

As such, it is reasonable to assume that someone looking to purchase an upright piano would go to a place that specializes in music equipment, such as a music store. The other options, such as a music class, college, or band, do not necessarily have a clear connection to the selling or purchasing of musical instruments."}

Placing it near the front door would suggest that it is intended for guests or family members to sit on while putting on or taking off shoes before entering or leaving the house.

To fail at completing something means that you did not get to the end or finish line of the task or project. The other options don't make sense in this context - winning, passing or doing well are more associated with competitions or tests, while succeeding is a more general term that could apply to achieving any sort of goal."}

He felt that form was less important than what?"}}, "k": "function\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John prioritizes function over style, indicating that he values practicality and usefulness more than aesthetics. The options shapeless, change shape, and chaos all imply a lack of structure or organization, which does not align with the idea of valuing function. Quality could be a possible answer, but the sentence specifically states that form is less important than something else, suggesting that there is another factor that John values more highly than both form and quality."}

A supermarket, on the other hand, is a large retail store that offers a wide range of groceries and household goods. Therefore, a boutique would be an unlikely location for a supermarket to be found, while strip malls, shopping centers, cities or towns, and even some states, such as Vermont, are more likely to have a supermarket."}

This leaves \"laziness\" and \"wasting time\" as potential correct answers, but more information would be needed to determine the most accurate choice."}

A broken jaw or sore mouth are common reasons for difficulty chewing food, while good digestion and avoiding choking are not directly related to the physical act of chewing. Eating is a general statement that does not provide a reason for the difficulty in chewing."}

This is a common practice in orchestras, where the musicians often wear formal attire during performances. The other options, such as music store or piano store, do not involve large musical groups with formal dress codes."}

Forests are known for having the highest concentration of trees, which are the primary source of leaves. In contrast, floral arrangements are typically made up of a few selected flowers and do not have a significant amount of leaves. The ground and fields may have some fallen leaves, but not as much as a forest. Compost piles are man-made and only have a specific amount of leaves depending on how much has been added."}

A meadow and surface of the earth could be vague or potentially dangerous options for children to interact with animals. A playroom is typically a contained indoor space for children to play with toys and not animals. Fairgrounds may have animal exhibits, but not necessarily opportunities for children to play with animals."}

The keyword that helps solve the question is \"protection.\" This suggests that the status of the bald eagle is related to conservation efforts to protect the species from harm. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, with \"colorado\" being a state and \"world\" and \"outside\" being too vague. \"America\" could have been a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer."}

This suggests that people take breaks in order to recharge their energy levels and be more productive or alert. The other options do not offer a clear explanation for why someone would need to take a quick rest during the day."}

This makes exhaustion the most likely answer for what could suddenly stop someone when running. Mushrooms and sweating are not physical barriers that could stop someone, and falling down and getting tired are more gradual processes and less likely to happen suddenly."}

Therefore, it would be logical for them to live in a habitat that provides a lot of trees, such as a tropical jungle. The other options, such as \"manual,\" \"work,\" and \"transit\" do not relate to the natural habitat of sloths. While some sloths may live in the countryside, this option is not specific enough as a habitat for them."}

They are often characterized by a paved or gravel surface and feature plants and other outdoor decor. Lawns are not typically associated with courtyards because they require large open spaces and regular maintenance. Therefore, if you have a courtyard, you are likely to have less lawn and therefore less lawn care. The other options are not related to the context of the question."}

A demonstration, where someone shows the functions and features of a product, would be a logical option for someone looking to learn more about a computer. The other options, such as a classroom, Facebook, school, or apartment, do not necessarily relate to learning about computer technology specifically."}

The option \"go fast\" is not relevant as the focus is on the longevity of the car, not its speed. \"Start running\" is not specific enough as all cars should start running if they are in good condition. \"Going too fast\" is not desirable as it suggests the car may have performance issues. \"Look good\" is subjective and does not relate to the car's performance."}

Costing money is a secondary aspect of owning a car, but not its primary purpose. Slowing down is a function of the car's brakes, which are designed to control its speed, but it is not the main purpose of the vehicle. Turning right is a maneuver that the car is capable of doing, but it is not its main purpose. Lastly, getting girls is not a function of cars; it is a subjective opinion or stereotype that does not relate to the actual purpose of a vehicle."}

This is a common procedure in aviation, as it allows the pilot to safely maneuver the aircraft onto the runway and land smoothly at the designated gate. While airplanes do carry people and may speed up during takeoff, it is highly unlikely for them to crash as they arrive at the gate."}

Mental illnesses are often chronic conditions that require ongoing treatment to manage symptoms. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, and some are even unrelated to mental illness."}

Given the context of the sentence, it is likely that the show featured animals behaving in a sensational or exaggerated way. The words \"sick,\" \"mammals,\" and \"males\" do not provide any clear information about what the show was about, whereas \"bite\" and \"attack\" suggest that the show may have focused on aggressive or predatory animal behavior. In this case, \"bite\" is the better choice because it is less extreme than \"attack\" and more likely to be associated with sensational or gimmicky TV programming."}

The context of the sentence mentions that this type of machine is expected, which suggests that it is in a location where loud machines are common. Industrial areas, such as factories or manufacturing plants, are known for having loud and noisy equipment, which makes it the most likely choice out of the options provided. The other choices do not typically have loud machinery, and in fact, quiet and peaceful environments such as a museum, house, or library would likely oppose the presence of loud machines."}

A ruler is typically used for measuring objects or distances, and it would be most useful when placed on a flat surface. The only option that refers to a flat surface is \"desk,\" which is typically a flat work surface. The other options such as \"drawer\" or \"the backside\" do not make sense in the context of the question. \"Office\" is too broad of a category and \"measure distance\" is not a location."}

The other options either do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or have a more positive connotation (e.g. strong feelings, excitement, arousal). Herpes may be a consequence of kissing if one of the participants has an active outbreak of the virus, but this would not necessarily be a result of kissing for too long."}

Of the given choices, \"look angry\" is the most appropriate response to seeing a mess caused by children, as it indicates frustration or annoyance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Quarries are places where stones are mined, so it doesn't make sense to arrange stones in a path there. The other options could potentially have paths made of stones or rocks, making them incorrect answers."}

They may also be found in sculptures and carvings. While they are native to Canada and can be found in rural areas and aviaries, these options do not specifically relate to the context of the question. The mention of a \"work\" suggests that the answer should relate to some sort of creative endeavor or representation."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Group people\" and \"work room\" do not make sense in the context of a hostess's job, and \"ready parlor for guests\" is too specific and not necessarily indicative of good performance. \"Park\" is also unrelated to the context."}

As an individual learns, they are likely to acquire more knowledge and become more knowledgeable about that subject or topic. Therefore, the correct answer is \"knowing more.\" \"Overconfidence\" is not a likely outcome of learning, as learning often involves recognizing one's limitations and areas for improvement. \"Effectiveness\" and \"growth\" may be outcomes of learning, but they are not as directly related to the process of learning itself. \"Head grows larger\" is not a likely outcome of learning in any way."}

The word \"compliance\" means following rules or regulations, so it is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "9a23a7f04e63bf9f4c7dfe50c58abfd2", "question": {"question_concept": "standing up", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "train"}, {"label": "B", "text": "effort"}, {"label": "C", "text": "balance"}, {"label": "D", "text": "feet"}, {"label": "E", "text": "muscles"}], "stem": "After standing up I had to sit right back down, why would I feel like this?"}}, "k": "muscles\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person experienced an issue with their body after standing up. Since the person had to sit right back down, it can be assumed that the problem was serious enough to prevent them from standing for longer periods of time. Muscles often play a crucial role in our ability to stand up and maintain our posture, so it is likely that the person's muscles were involved in some way. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "e3426e4f60c142aa3d813479f79d6305", "question": {"question_concept": "bar", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "new york city"}, {"label": "B", "text": "las vegas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "restaurant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "nightclub"}, {"label": "E", "text": "park"}], "stem": "Where do you go on a night out before going to the bar?"}}, "k": "nightclub\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a typical sequence of activities for a night out, and is looking for the location where one might go before going to a bar. A common choice for pre-bar activities is a nightclub, as they often have a lively atmosphere and can be a good place to socialize and dance. The other options (city, park, etc.) do not fit the context of the question."}

The most likely place to store a gun in a home would be a secure drawer, as it would be easily accessible to the owner but not to potential intruders. The other options (police station, crime scene, restroom, and holster) do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The fiddle is a stringed instrument commonly used in folk and country music, which often has a lively, joyful sound. Jumping up and down and playing games are not musical instruments, while singing can be done in a variety of moods and styles, making the fiddle the most likely correct answer."}

The other options (watch film, fire game, hang out at bar, go skiing) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and do not involve the use of a ramp."}

While some birds have feathers and some people may use calligraphy pens, they do not have quills like porcupines do. Chickens do not have quills at all, and while hedgehogs do have spines, they are not the same as quills."}

The other options, such as school building, paper, or city, may be associated with an office, but they do not directly answer the question of why someone would go to an office. Habit is also not a valid option, as it does not provide a specific reason for going to an office."}

Eating during digestion can interrupt this process and lead to discomfort or even illness. Therefore, it is generally considered the worst time to have food. The other options do not necessarily relate to the timing of eating."}

The phrase \"go broke\" is a common expression used to describe someone who has spent all their money and has no more left. Therefore, it is the most logical choice among the options. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information given."}

While a mouse may prefer a house for shelter and food, they are also known to inhabit other areas, such as gardens, where they can find food and build nests. The other options, such as tin or cupboard, do not provide a suitable habitat for a mouse."}

Therefore, the correct answer is \"heading north\". \"Speed up\" and \"go fast\" are actions that relate to how the car is driving rather than its destination. \"Headed south\" is the opposite direction of the car's stated route."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, and are unlikely to be correct answers. \"Dirt\" refers to soil or earth, \"subway\" is a type of public transportation system, \"state park\" is a protected natural area, and \"container\" is a general term that could refer to any type of object used for holding things."}

Boiling is a common method and involves placing the potato in a pot of boiling water until it is cooked through. The other options do not make sense in the context of cooking a potato. Placing a potato in a paper bag, restaurants, underground, or a cupboard will not cook the potato."}

The word \"fortune\" implies wealth or financial gain. The option \"imagination\" aligns with this idea as it suggests that writers who are able to come up with innovative and creative ideas can stand out in the competitive field of writing and potentially earn a substantial income. The other options, such as \"cookie\" and \"real estate,\" have no clear association with the context of the sentence. \"Bank\" and \"bankroll\" are related to finances but do not specifically tie into the concept of a writer's success."}

Homelessness often involves situations of poverty, insecurity, and limited access to resources such as food, clothing, and healthcare. While it is possible that some residents may be able to find happiness or improve their quality of life while in a shelter, the phrase \"sometimes bad\" is a more likely interpretation of the question. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the question."}

The word \"relaxation\" is often associated with activities that are calming and enjoyable, and many people turn to knitting as a way to unwind and reduce stress. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. \"Arthritis\" is a medical condition that is not typically linked to knitting, while \"adrenaline\" suggests excitement and is not related to the calm and creative nature of knitting. The last option, \"your sweater may produced\" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

He treated it like it was what?"}}, "k": "free money\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John received a sum of money he wasn't expecting and was excited about it. The phrase \"treated it like it was\" suggests that John had a positive attitude towards the money and saw it as a bonus, rather than something he earned or worked for.

The option \"concentrate\" makes sense as it implies that Joe's ability to focus was intact despite his apparent state. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence - \"awake\" is too general, \"repeat\" doesn't make sense as memorizing involves repetition, \"sleeping\" seems unlikely, and \"read aloud\" is unrelated."}

Sea anemones are often found in tide pools because they can tolerate changing water levels and temperatures. The other options are not typically associated with sea creatures or coastal environments. The nursery may refer to a fish or shellfish hatchery, the museum would be a place to view preserved specimens, and the Gulf of Mexico is a large body of water, none of which would be likely locations to find a sea anemone after high tide."}

If you can't get out of the house you might decide to do what?"}}, "k": "listen to music\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is stuck at home and looking for a way to alleviate boredom. Playing cards or skateboarding would require leaving the house, so those options can be ruled out. Meeting interesting people would also require leaving the house, and it's not a guaranteed way to alleviate boredom. Going to a concert is an option, but if the person can't leave the house, then it's not feasible. Listening to music, however, can easily be done at home and is a common way to pass the time when bored."}

Of the options given, the frying pan is the only one that is commonly used for this purpose. Oil is often used as a cooking ingredient, but is not specifically used to cook meat on top of.

Therefore, the only logical choice is \"spending money\" as that is a common action that occurs after someone has cash in hand. \"Happy\" could be an emotional response, but it is not a concrete action that one would take."}

Because of this, he didn't have time for what?"}}, "k": "stay home\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John went to a party that lasted all night, which suggests that he was busy during the entirety of the event. The fact that he didn't have time for something implies that he wanted to do it, but couldn't because he was at the party. The option \"stay home\" is the best fit for this context because it suggests that John wanted to stay home but didn't have time to do so because he was at the party all night. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well."}

However, setting the table is a task that can be done in the dining room and would be helpful for mealtime. The other options don't seem relevant to the context of the sentence - forming opinions, making honey, becoming an adult, and gathering flowers don't have anything to do with helping out in the dining room."}

The psychologist's assessment that the person is \"mentally\" something further supports this idea, as it suggests a deeper, internal issue. \"Slow\" and \"fun\" do not fit the context of the sentence, while \"understood\" and \"embarrassment\" are possible interpretations, they do not fully capture the severity or implication of the psychologist's assessment. \"Suffering\" is the most appropriate option given the context."}

The phrase \"perform better\" implies that the body responds positively to physical competition, perhaps by increasing adrenaline or releasing endorphins. The other options also describe physical responses to competition, but they do not necessarily imply an improvement in performance. Tension could lead to decreased performance, winning or losing is a result of competition rather than a physical response, and sweating and releasing heat are more automatic bodily functions than intentional responses."}

Summarizing main points may also be helpful, but it may not include all the necessary details. Closing one's mouth or talking will not be effective since the deaf person cannot hear.

Each time a document is printed, it requires a sheet of paper, which can quickly add up if a large number of documents are printed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - \"explode\" and \"noise\" are completely unrelated, \"store information\" doesn't impact the cost of printing, and \"queue\" refers to the process of waiting in line, which has no bearing on the cost of printing."}

Therefore, the statement that God will never do anything is often interpreted as a way of emphasizing God's unlimited power and omnipotence. The other options may not be accurate as they suggest limitations on God's actions or attributes that are not universally agreed upon in all religions."}

The other options do not fit the definition of having a surface with multiple sides - an object can be any shape, a geometry problem is an abstract concept and not a physical object, a lake has a surface but it's not made up of sides or faces, and a triangle has three sides but is a two-dimensional shape."}

This is its primary function and is directly related to the question.

The phrase \"literally let you see the story\" implies that the pop-ups created a visual representation of the plot or characters. The option \"open book\" is the only one that specifically relates to this idea, as the other choices do not have a clear connection to books or visual storytelling."}

The most common place to clean dishes after dinner is in a dishwasher. The other options do not make logical sense, as a restaurant kitchen and party would not be where the family's dirty dishes would go, and loading the dishes in the son's room or cabinet would not be an appropriate chore after dinner."}

French government could be an option, but there is a specific reference to a particular place, which is not the case with the generic term \"each city.\" The zoo and office building are completely unrelated and do not fit the context of the sentence."}

The most logical place to keep a valuable object like a check would be in a locked desk drawer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The option \"pleasure\" is the most fitting word to describe the feeling that someone might get from purchasing products. The other options, such as \"owning\" or \"debt,\" do not make sense as a way to replace emotions or provide an outlet for feelings. The option \"smart\" may suggest a feeling of satisfaction or accomplishment from making a savvy purchase, but it does not fit with the context of the sentence."}

Race tracks are primarily used for horse racing and not for judging horses on their appearance. Horses raised by humans and those in fields may not necessarily be judged on their appearance. The countryside does not provide a clear indication of where horses are judged on their appearance."}

Non-fiction books may cover a wide range of topics, from history and science to self-help and biographies. While some non-fiction books may be enjoyable to read, the primary reason people typically choose to read non-fiction is to acquire new information or skills. The other options listed are not commonly associated with reading non-fiction."}

The other options don't seem as suitable for this context - watching TV, eating, or making blankets may require more attention and movement, and the sentence already mentions \"knitting\" so it's unlikely that the correct answer involves a different activity."}

Tables provide a flat surface to work on and are commonly found in homes and offices. A meeting, drawer, toilet, or garage are not typically used for working on papers, making them unlikely answers."}

Compared to that, Leo's 2000 dollar debt seemed what?"}}, "k": "tiny\nKnowledge: The sentence sets up a comparison between John's debt of 50 million dollars and Leo's debt of 2000 dollars, implying that there is a significant difference in scale between the two. The word \"massive\" further emphasizes the size of John's debt, making the other options - \"dwarf,\" \"inconsequential,\" \"insubstantial,\" and \"lame\" - inappropriate choices. \"Tiny\" accurately conveys the sense of insignificance of Leo's debt compared to John's."}

The other options are not likely to be associated with pollution in the sky. Forests and streets are typically associated with ground-level pollution, and car shows are usually a type of event rather than a source of pollution. The phrase \"caused by humans\" is too general to be a specific answer to the question."}

However, paralysis is a highly unlikely side effect and does not have any clear connection to alcohol consumption. It is therefore the correct answer to the question."}

The phrase \"transfer of information\" directly refers to the act of conveying information from one person to another, making it the most appropriate choice. \"Misunderstandings\" and \"confusion\" suggest a breakdown in communication, while \"learning\" may not have a clear connection to the situation. \"Silence\" is not a proactive approach to communication and will not help in achieving the desired outcome."}

The other options (stream, aquarium, boat ride) are locations where one might find fish, but they are not appropriate answers to the question being asked. The answer is therefore the option that is explicitly mentioned in the question."}

Spending time may include going to the movies, playing games, going out to eat, or any number of other social activities that people do with their friends. The other options are more specific and do not apply to all types of friendships or social situations."}

This can lead to financial strains and difficulties paying for necessities. Spending money is not a likely result because it is a given that money will be spent when buying products. Poverty is a possible outcome, but it is too extreme and not necessarily a direct result of buying products in excess. Comparison shopping is a strategy used to save money while overstocking is the opposite of buying products in excess."}

The context of the sentence implies that the person is taking these medicines in order to achieve a certain goal, which can be inferred from the choices given. Acceptance, acknowledgment, passing grade, and intellectual challenge do not relate to the purpose of taking analgesics, while avoiding pain is a common reason for taking them."}

The options \"ocean\" and \"water cooler\" do not make sense in this context, as they are not places for glassware. \"Dining room\" could be a possible location, but it is not specific enough. \"Dishwasher\" and \"cabinet\" are commonly used places to store or clean glassware after use, making them the most likely answers."}

The other options are not relevant to buying food - a freezer is a storage device, home is a location, hatred is an emotion, and a kitchen is a room in a home where food is prepared."}

The other options do not fit into the context of admitting one's mistakes. An accident is an unforeseeable event, learning to swim is unrelated to admitting mistakes, thanking God may show gratitude but does not relate to taking responsibility, and feeling relieved may only be a byproduct of admitting mistakes, not the purpose behind it."}

The only logical answer is to have money readily available to cover those costs. Going somewhere, energy, and flying in an airplane are not relevant to the question, and spending frivolously could actually cause more financial trouble in the long run. Having money is the most practical and responsible option for dealing with unexpected expenses while traveling."}

The cheapest way to travel by public transportation is often by bus, so it makes sense that the sight of beggars asking for change or a ticket would be common at a bus depot. The other options, such as a train station or a beach, do not have the same connection to public transportation or the idea of traveling on a budget."}

A common example of such a location is a shopping mall. Additionally, the option \"gap\" is a specific brand of clothing, and the options \"bedroom\" and \"bathroom\" are private spaces unlikely to have multiple jeans vendors.

Therefore, it is likely to be heard on a radio station or seen on a TV channel. A microphone is a device used for capturing sound, but it is not necessarily associated with the location where the sound is transmitted. An arena is a large venue where sports or entertainment events are held and is not commonly associated with broadcasting. Trees and town are also not related to the concept of broadcasting."}

A coffee table book is typically defined as a large, visually appealing book meant to be displayed on a coffee table for guests to browse through. This could potentially be the type of book that Kramer wrote as it would be a good fit for a self-referential theme.

The options \"fight enemy\" and \"vicinity\" do not fit with the idea of avoiding danger, while \"secure\" is too broad and could refer to many different things. \"Being safe\" and \"safety\" both directly relate to the sense of safety and avoiding danger, making them the most likely correct answer options."}

This is a common trait among many species of foxes and is essential to their survival as it provides protection from predators and harsh weather. The other options, such as hen house, California, England, and mountains, do not match the typical habitat of foxes."}

We're better at doing what?"}}, "k": "make tools\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that sets humans apart from animals, and this something has allowed them to become dominant on the planet. The options \"eat eggs,\" \"eat dosa,\" and \"smoke pot\" have no obvious connection to the sentence. \"Talk to each other\" may be a possibility, but the tone of the sentence suggests that the thing that sets humans apart is something more concrete. \"Make tools\" is a common characteristic cited by anthropologists and historians as the factor that allowed humans to develop and dominate over other species."}

Suburbs and neighborhoods are commonly associated with having safe environments for families, while \"back of house\" and \"roundabout\" do not make sense in this context. \"Property\" could work, but it does not specify the type of area or neighborhood they are in."}

The phrase \"pail to be lowered\" suggests that the object was used for retrieving something from a deep location. A wishing well fits this description as people could throw coins in it to make a wish and the coins would be retrieved from the bottom using a pail on a rope. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The water was cold because it was the middle of winter and he cried out to his crew for help.  They couldn't hear him over the sound of the what?"}}, "k": "motor\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was in a body of water and there was a crew with him. The fact that Joe cried out for help implies that there was some sort of noise or disturbance going on. The sentence also mentions it was the middle of winter, which indicates that there may have been some weather-related conditions affecting the situation. The option \"motor\" is the most likely answer as it could be creating noise and disturbance in the water, making it difficult for Joe's cries for help to be heard. The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "8c607d2e2e897d74048fcc794137b683", "question": {"question_concept": "human", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "deep thought"}, {"label": "B", "text": "park"}, {"label": "C", "text": "friend's house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "place of work"}, {"label": "E", "text": "school"}], "stem": "When a human is earning money, where are they often found?"}}, "k": "place of work\nKnowledge: The term \"earning money\" typically refers to someone working and receiving payment for their job. Therefore, the correct answer is likely a location associated with work. \"Deep thought\" and \"park\" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Friend's house\" may be a location where someone spends leisure time, but it is unlikely to be related to earning money. \"School\" is a place where people may learn and develop skills, but it is not necessarily where they earn money."}

The only option that fits this context is \"on tv\", as it implies that they were going to watch the event from the comfort of their own home or another location, rather than actually attending it in person. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "668dc6bce771b10cbf6336f3ec76520a", "question": {"question_concept": "play chess", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "satisfaction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "have fun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "thrilling"}, {"label": "D", "text": "made"}, {"label": "E", "text": "smart"}], "stem": "Why do people play chess on the weekends?"}}, "k": "satisfaction\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that people play chess on the weekends for a specific reason, and one that may not necessarily be related to having fun or seeking a thrilling experience. The word \"satisfaction\" suggests that the act of playing chess gives individuals a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment, which could be a motivating factor for why they choose to play on the weekends. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for the reason behind playing chess on weekends."}

The other options (work, tacos, mass, wrestle) do not match the expected activity in gym class and therefore are not likely to be the correct answer."}

Dropping a marble could be part of a game that involves rolling and tossing marbles, but it is not likely related to the other options such as pouch, home, store, or jar."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "6c1c1c282cebe8917f607f0dbc1c102e", "question": {"question_concept": "human", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "write"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat cake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "smile"}, {"label": "D", "text": "think critically"}, {"label": "E", "text": "die"}], "stem": "We are all human, and we all what?"}}, "k": "die\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that all humans share a common experience or fate, which is something that we all do or will do. The options \"write,\" \"eat cake,\" and \"smile\" do not reflect a universal experience or fate, while \"think critically\" may be too specific or subjective to apply universally. \"Die\" is a universal experience that all humans share, regardless of culture, language, or belief system."}

Therefore, the goal would be to fall asleep. The other options do not reflect a typical bedtime goal, as being lazy, having insomnia, or dreaming are not necessarily the intended outcomes of getting into bed."}

The options \"museum\" and \"high school band\" do not make sense in this context, as the former does not involve musical performance and the latter would likely have been mentioned specifically as a separate option. \"Marching band\" makes sense as a possible choice, as it involves playing instruments while walking in a synchronized manner. However, the use of the term \"player\" instead of \"marcher\" suggests that the sentence is referring to a more general type of musical group, which is why \"band\" and \"orchestra\" are both plausible options."}

This is supported by the fact that the other options (expiration, death, start reproduction) are events that occur later in the life cycle, while \"sometimes bad\" is too vague and does not make sense in this context."}

The most appropriate and common place to store fabric in a home would be a sewing room where someone has space to store and work with their materials. The other options may have fabric, but they are not typically places where one would store their personal fabric collection. A clothing store or clothes store would only have fabric for sale, and a tailor shop may have fabric but it would be primarily used for alterations or repairs. A cotton mill is a manufacturing facility for making fabric, not a place to store it in a personal setting."}

Of the options given, \"oversupply\" is the only one directly related to the concept of having more of a product than is needed or desired, which is not desirable for companies as it can lead to waste and decreased profitability. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not necessarily relate to the act of playing basketball specifically. Sweating and knee injury may occur during basketball, but they don't necessarily describe what's happening while the person is playing for a long time. Pain is too broad and can't be assumed without more information. Medium is unrelated and doesn't make sense in this context."}

The options \"library,\" \"motel,\" \"airport,\" and \"subway\" do not fit this context because they do not typically have areas designated for waiting for public transportation. \"Bus stop\" is the only option that fits this context and would be a likely place for someone to wait for mass transit."}

A hospital is a facility equipped to provide medical care and treatment for such situations, while the other options (synagogue, bus stop, building) are not specifically related to medical assistance. \"For help\" is too general and does not provide any specific information about the kind of help required, so it cannot be the correct answer."}

Making out a will involves determining who will receive a person's possessions and assets after their death. The other options are either unrelated to the context of the sentence or inappropriate in this context."}

One common hazard that cats face is falling, especially if they are moving across narrow ledges or unstable surfaces. The other answer choices (getting wet, eating vegetables, wool sweater, sharp claws) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Clouding over refers to the process of clouds forming and thickening, which is often a precursor to rainfall. In contrast, the other options do not accurately describe the behavior of the sky before a rain. Appearing beautiful or blue are aesthetic descriptions, while showing a rainbow occurs during or after the rain. Rain water is a consequence of the rain, rather than a behavior of the sky."}

The other options may also contain some of these items, but they do not necessarily indicate where all the listed items can be found. \"University\" implies a specific location, while \"drawer\" and \"table\" do not provide enough context to indicate where all the listed items can be found. \"Work\" is too general and does not specify a specific location."}

The other options (ball stopped, garden) do not have any clear connection to the habitat or environment that is suitable for lizards. West Texas and warm place are somewhat related, as West Texas is known for its hot and dry climate, but arid regions is a more specific and accurate answer."}

The other options are locations where one might bring a briefcase, but they do not answer the question being asked."}

The phrase \"picked up his pace\" implies a desire to increase speed, and \"to a run\" indicates that the person is running as fast as they can. The other options do not fit with the context of someone increasing their speed to a run."}

The most logical solution would be to try to make new friends by talking to people. This option is the only one that presents a proactive solution to the problem. \"Try again\" is too vague and doesn't offer any specific action, while \"fall asleep\" and \"stand alone\" do not offer any solutions to the problem at all. \"Thank god\" is not relevant to the question."}

The phrase \"death and decay\" is often used to describe the natural process by which a deceased organism breaks down and returns to the earth. The other options do not accurately describe the process of dying and its effects on organic material."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "33ea932a876ac0361c9eefeff1d24e92", "question": {"question_concept": "everyone", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "feelings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "unique personality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "different standards"}, {"label": "E", "text": "values"}], "stem": "What does everyone have in relation to other people?"}}, "k": "feelings\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that there is something that all people have in common when it comes to their relationships with others. Since the other options do not relate to relationships or social interactions, we can eliminate them. Unique personalities and different standards are individual traits that are likely to vary from person to person. While values may also be shared by many individuals, they are not necessarily related specifically to interpersonal relationships. Lastly, food is not a trait that everyone possesses in relation to others. Therefore, the correct answer is that feelings, such as emotions and empathy, are something that everyone has in common when it comes to interacting with others."}

The other options, such as asking questions or counting to ten, may come later in the conversation or interaction but would not be the first thing you ask a child. Costume and dress herself do not make sense in this context as they are not related to initial introductions."}

The other options do not make as much sense, as a counter or desk may only offer a limited selection of items, a train station typically only sells transportation-related items or snacks, and a school room is not typically a place where items are sold."}

This option is the most straightforward and logical choice. Taking pictures and experiencing new things are both possible outcomes of exploring a new place, but they are not the main action being described in the sentence. \"Interesting\" and \"change of surroundings\" are both vague and do not provide a clear action that can be taken to see new things in a new place."}

When ice melts, it turns into water due to the increase in temperature. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Ice might be sculptured or carved, but not necessarily as a result of being in the sun. Ice cream is made from milk, sugar, and cream, and has nothing to do with the sun. Finally, Antarctica is a continent covered in ice, but the answer should be related to what happens to ice when exposed to the sun."}

Cabinets are commonly found in kitchens and dining areas and are often equipped with shelves, compartments, and slots for organizing dishes of various shapes and sizes. The option \"apartment\" is not applicable because it refers to a type of dwelling, not a storage location."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "2d3c9d3dff1a7a8253180cb3de1ceeea", "question": {"question_concept": "moss", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "niagra falls"}, {"label": "B", "text": "forest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "waterfall"}, {"label": "D", "text": "ground"}, {"label": "E", "text": "tree"}], "stem": "The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man?"}}, "k": "ground\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions the man laying on a soft surface, which suggests that he is on the ground. Additionally, the man looks up at the trees, which suggests that he is not in a tree or on top of a waterfall. Niagara Falls is not mentioned in the sentence, and while the man is in a forest, the question specifically asks for his location within the forest, which is on the ground."}

This is a common practice in meditation, where the person may sit quietly and focus their attention on their breath, mantra, or other object of contemplation while their eyes move naturally. The other options do not fit with the description of someone in a meditative state, such as reading or falling asleep."}

The desk drawer and desktop are specific to individual workstations, while the office building and manual are too broad and do not necessarily guarantee the presence of staplers. The office supply store, on the other hand, is a likely location where customers can expect to find a variety of office supplies, including staplers."}

Martorell is a town located outside of Barcelona that has several museums, including the Museu de Martorell and the Museu de la Lliça. The other options such as cinema, falling down, show, or airplane do not relate to being at a museum outside of Barcelona."}

The other options are less likely, as a toy box may contain unused toys, movies do not involve physical toys, and toybos and child park are not commonly associated with the act of playing with a toy soldier."}

The options pocket, terrorist's hands, sea ship, and briefcase are unlikely places to use a plane ticket. The airport is the most reasonable answer as it is where travelers go to check in and board their flights."}

The other options, such as market or anthology, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Moreover, \"table\" and \"countryside\" could be associated with arranging flowers but, unlike \"vase\", they are not objects used for this purpose."}

Using a bridge would be the most practical way to cross a river while maintaining a hairstyle, as it allows a person to walk across without getting wet or tangled up in vegetation. The other options (Wisconsin, waterfall, hatred, valley) are not relevant to the question and do not provide any clues to the correct answer."}

There were no bottles available.  He had to settle for what?."}}, "k": "can\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Batman had to settle for something, indicating that he was looking for a specific type of container to hold his beer. The options \"shelf,\" \"soccer game,\" and \"refrigerator\" are not containers and are therefore unlikely choices. A keg is a large container typically used for serving beer at a party, which may not be practical for one person to consume alone. A can is a small, single-serving container commonly used for holding beer, making it the most likely choice for Batman in this scenario."}

The phrase \"you can find a monkey\" suggests that the question is about the distribution or habitat of a particular species. West Africa is home to many primates, including monkeys, and the rain forest is a common habitat for these animals. The other options are either not related to West Africa or do not have any connection to monkeys or their habitat."}

It is possible that the other options, such as humor or laughter, may diffuse the anger, but it is unlikely that they would be the most common or expected outcomes in this context. \"Fight\" is the most reasonable choice given the potentially volatile nature of an angry person."}

It is unlikely for someone to feel joy in such a situation, as it goes against most social and cultural norms. In fact, killing people often creates a sense of guilt and fear of punishment (like going to prison) in the person who committed the act. Seeking vengeance could be a possible motive for killing someone, but it is not an emotion that one experiences in the aftermath of the act. \"Afraid\" and \"terrible\" may describe the emotions of the victim or those who witness the act, but not of the person who committed it."}

He was concerned about the consequences of many what?"}}, "k": "head injuries\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James has collided with someone playing football multiple times, and he is worried about the consequences. Given the physical nature of football, the most likely consequence is some kind of injury, and the fact that the sentence specifically mentions \"not for the first time\" suggests that this is an ongoing issue. Head injuries are a particularly serious concern in contact sports like football, as they can lead to long-term health problems. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well."}

The phrase \"we don't got long\" implies a sense of urgency or the idea that life is short, which reinforces the importance of enjoying life. The other answer choices are either too specific (such as \"get laid\") or don't quite capture the sentiment of the sentence."}

The other choices, such as dessert or desert country, are not locations where pet lizards are commonly found or sold. Tropical areas may be a viable option, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer. The zoo is also not relevant, as it is a place to see animals but not to purchase them as pets."}

Since the wife was in a committed relationship with her husband, the most likely option would be the end of their marriage. The other choices may also be affected by discovering an affair, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well."}

The Milky Way is not a constellation, but a galaxy that Earth is a part of. \"God's creation\" is too vague and doesn't refer to any specific astronomical object. \"Universe\" is too broad and refers to everything that exists, not just constellations. \"One moon\" is not a constellation either, but a natural satellite of Earth. \"Stars\" is the best answer because constellations are made up of stars and some of the most famous constellations include Orion, Ursa Major, and Cassiopeia."}

The most likely location for this would be the lobby, as it is a central gathering spot for hotel guests. Room service and church basements are unlikely venues for a hotel reception, while a large room and country club may be possible options but are not as strongly suggested by the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not logically fit with the context of the sentence. \"Change of heart\" implies a reversal of opinion, which is not relevant in this context. \"Anguish\" and \"anxiety\" suggest emotional distress, which is not necessarily related to the outcome of a court case. \"Anger\" could potentially be a cause of a court case being dismissed, but it is not as likely as \"boredom\" in this scenario."}

This consequence is likely related to the digestion of the beans, which can produce gas and lead to flatulence. The other options are unrelated to beans or digestion, and do not provide a logical explanation for the suggested consequence."}

He was never what?"}}, "k": "distant\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John was approachable and easy to communicate with. It can be inferred from the sentence that John was not a distant person because the speaker found it easy to talk to him. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence."}

The most likely option is the kitchen, as this is where many people prepare and consume their coffee in the morning. The other options (table, office, desk, and ocean) do not have a clear connection to coffee consumption."}

They had planed a slow day. They didn't want to do much.  They just wanted what?"}}, "k": "relaxation\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James and his friend did not want to do much on their planned slow day, which indicates a desire for relaxation. The other choices, such as panic, alarm, joy, and cheer, do not align with the context of wanting a slow day and not wanting to do much."}

But that was okay, he only kept her for milk, and he didn't think he'd find good farmland in a place as cold as where?"}}, "k": "michigan\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is a farmer and has a heifer which he keeps for milk. The sentence also implies that Dan lives in a place which is cold and where finding good farmland may be difficult. Among the given options, Michigan is known for its cold climate and is also a state with a significant farming industry, making it a likely candidate. The other options do not match the context given in the sentence."}

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or would be unlikely for Alice to do based on the information provided."}

The glove compartment is a common place to store maps, so it makes sense that the character would retrieve a map from there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as a car stand or bus depot, are not commonly associated with personal keys as they usually require a different type of access or security measure. Similarly, while a key may be used at a hotel, it would not typically be referred to as a \"personal\" key, as it is not solely for the use of one person."}

Additionally, the phrase \"that time of day\" implies that the cat is used to being fed at a certain time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well."}

This suggests that they joined a music group that includes parts for different types of voices, such as a choir. The other options do not typically involve vocalists or sections based on vocal range."}

This implies that finding a Japanese restaurant run by non-Japanese people is uncommon. Options like California, Downtown, and China Town may have a higher population of Japanese people and therefore a higher likelihood of finding a restaurant run by Japanese people. Tokyo is part of Japan, so it doesn't fit the question. A large town would have a more diverse population and may have non-Japanese people running Japanese restaurants."}

The fact that the animals in the sentence are described as having hair and not laying eggs is a strong hint that they are indeed mammals, as these are both common traits among this group. The other options (reproduce asexually, males, attack, ocean) are not related to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated."}

The options \"shop\" and \"bookcase\" do not make sense in this context. \"Shelf\" could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough. \"Kitchen\" is too broad, as there are many places in a kitchen where food could be stored. \"Refrigerators\" is the correct answer, as it is a common practice to refrigerate food after it has been opened to prevent spoilage."}

It was a what?"}}, "k": "nightmare\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam had a frightening dream that caused him to remain awake, and the option that best fits this description is \"nightmare.\" A nightmare is a type of dream that causes feelings of fear, terror, or distress and can sometimes awaken the dreamer.

Practice and a sense of balance may help with riding a bike, but they do not directly cause it to move. Driving could refer to operating a motor vehicle, which is not relevant to this question. \"Good balance\" is similar to the \"sense of balance\" option and does not explain how a bike moves."}

Therefore, an organ is the only option in the list that is related to the concept of pipe divisions. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question."}

The verb \"funnel\" can describe the act of congregating or gathering in a specific direction or location, such as into a church. The other options do not make sense in the context of a church gathering. The phrase \"wind instrument\" is unrelated, as is \"blunderbuss,\" which is a type of gun. The phrase \"associated with telephones\" is also unrelated to the context of the sentence."}

The most likely place to borrow furniture would be from someone nearby who is willing to lend it to you, such as a neighbor's house. The other options do not have any logical connection to borrowing furniture."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "abb090bbc572be1016bcd5f261f28e76", "question": {"question_concept": "living", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "death"}, {"label": "B", "text": "flying"}, {"label": "C", "text": "reproducing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "food consumed"}, {"label": "E", "text": "eventually die"}], "stem": "What must happen for an animal to and it's offspring to continue livng?"}}, "k": "reproducing\nKnowledge: The question is asking about what must happen for an animal and its offspring to continue living, which suggests that the animal needs to ensure its continuation through reproduction. Reproduction is the biological imperative for animals to pass on their genes and ensure the survival of their species. Death and eventually dying are not necessary for an animal and its offspring to continue living, while flying and food consumed do not address the question of continuation through future generations."}

A cellar is a common location for storing wine because it provides these optimal conditions. The other options, movies, bed, moon, and vault, do not provide an appropriate environment for storing wine."}

The answer is likely related to the physical establishment or location of the steakhouse, so options Michigan and Florida are less likely to be the correct answer. Wine is unrelated to the initial step of opening a steakhouse, so it can be eliminated as well. Texas could potentially be the correct answer if the context or location of the question included Texas, but without that information, building is the most logical answer as it pertains directly to the physical establishment."}

Taking up a musical activity would provide mental stimulation and entertainment without requiring a lot of physical exertion. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either suggest excessive effort (serious, longplay) or complete inactivity (eat cake, doing nothing)."}

What might that be?"}}, "k": "garage\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was doing something outside and found spiders. Given the context, it is most likely that Joe was checking something that is commonly found in a garage, such as tools, equipment, or a vehicle. The other options, such as a cupboard, closet, or mailbox, are less likely to house spiders and are more associated with indoor spaces."}

Among the options provided, waiting for the date to arrive is the most reasonable course of action, as it allows a chance for the person to arrive and explain their tardiness. Bathing or getting a haircut would not be relevant in this scenario. Planning revenge would be an extreme and inappropriate response, and dressing nice (though important for a date) would not serve any purpose if the date does not show up."}

The option \"dress herself\" would be incorrect as the sentence specifies that the subject is an adult male. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This implies that the regular price of the items is considered high. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

A nursery is a facility where plants, including flowers, are cultivated for sale or transplantation. The other options (Michigan, swimming pool, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico) are not suitable places to grow flowers in a facility."}

The phrase \"shine brightly\" is a common way of describing the intensity of sunlight, and would make the most sense in this context. The other options either don't make sense or are unlikely given the context."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "cce13a32fedb997c017d3fac87c34912", "question": {"question_concept": "releasing energy", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "damage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "wonderful"}, {"label": "C", "text": "exhaustion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "orgasm"}, {"label": "E", "text": "lazy"}], "stem": "How might releasing energy that has built up feel?"}}, "k": "orgasm\nKnowledge: Releasing built-up energy is often associated with sexual pleasure and orgasm.

However, they still have their sense of hearing, which allows them to keep up with current events and hear news. Therefore, the correct answer is \"hear news.\""}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "3e536d9253bfac45de83e8ee291ca143", "question": {"question_concept": "furniture", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "apartment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "loft"}, {"label": "C", "text": "store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "rug"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stairs"}], "stem": "Where might it be hard to get furniture to?"}}, "k": "stairs\nKnowledge: The word \"hard\" suggests that there is some difficulty or obstacle in bringing furniture to this location, and the word \"stairs\" is a commonly known obstacle in moving furniture. Apartments and lofts are common living spaces that may have stairs, but the option \"rug\" and \"store\" do not have any clear connection to the context of difficulty in bringing furniture."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "9f830faa0f8e3d7fb3a658c15a5fbe63", "question": {"question_concept": "attending school", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "detention"}, {"label": "B", "text": "graduate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "follower"}, {"label": "D", "text": "inspiration"}, {"label": "E", "text": "boredom"}], "stem": "A great teacher can be what when you are attending school?"}}, "k": "inspiration\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that a great teacher can have a positive impact on a student's experience in school. The word \"inspiration\" suggests that a great teacher can motivate and encourage students to achieve their goals and perform well academically. The other options, such as \"detention,\" \"graduate,\" \"follower,\" and \"boredom,\" do not fit the context of the sentence or convey a positive meaning."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "bbcef409e0acb71b515acc144d5b402c_1", "question": {"question_concept": "jeans", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "shopping mall"}, {"label": "B", "text": "museum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "laundromat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "clothing store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "bedroom"}], "stem": "Where would you get jeans and other wearable items to take home with you?"}}, "k": "clothing store\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the sentence is asking about where to get wearable items to take home, which is a common function of a clothing store. A shopping mall may also have clothing stores, but it is not specific enough to answer the question accurately. A museum would not typically sell wearable items. A laundromat is a place where clothes are washed, not bought. A bedroom is an inappropriate choice as it is a place for sleeping and not shopping."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "cbb0c9a69ca0922371a48177087ef407", "question": {"question_concept": "clouds", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sky"}, {"label": "B", "text": "top of mountain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "air"}, {"label": "D", "text": "ground level"}, {"label": "E", "text": "outer space"}], "stem": "In what substance do clouds float?"}}, "k": "air\nKnowledge: Clouds are formed by water vapor that condenses in the atmosphere. They float because they are less dense than the surrounding air. This is why they can be seen at different altitudes depending on the conditions in the atmosphere. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question as clouds are a feature of the atmosphere and not found on the ground or in outer space."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "b92f786638796fc028947ac0e9a44fef", "question": {"question_concept": "empire state building", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "manhattan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "office"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the city"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fifth avenue"}, {"label": "E", "text": "new york city"}], "stem": "Where is the large area location of the empire state building?"}}, "k": "manhattan\nKnowledge: The Empire State Building is well-known for being a landmark in New York City, specifically in the borough of Manhattan. The other options do not accurately describe the location of the building, as \"office\" and \"the city\" are too general, \"Fifth Avenue\" is only one street in Manhattan, and \"New York City\" is the name of the city as a whole, not a specific area within it."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "5abeb4a2126597d4ef7b5a32e9e22abf", "question": {"question_concept": "cup of coffee", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "coffee shop"}, {"label": "B", "text": "office"}, {"label": "C", "text": "table"}, {"label": "D", "text": "washing"}, {"label": "E", "text": "kitchen"}], "stem": "Where do most people make coffee?"}}, "k": "kitchen\nKnowledge: Making coffee is typically done in a kitchen, which has the necessary equipment like a coffee maker, filters, and mugs. While coffee shops and offices may also have coffee makers, these locations are not typically associated with the act of \"making\" coffee, which suggests a more personal setting like a kitchen. Washing and table also do not make sense as coffee-making locations."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "8d4b0312f02be445e09a9462873d02bb", "question": {"question_concept": "body", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "bodycam"}, {"label": "B", "text": "home"}, {"label": "C", "text": "coffin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "funeral"}, {"label": "E", "text": "graveyard"}], "stem": "What kind of service is my body a part of when I'm no longer here?"}}, "k": "funeral\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to what happens to their body after they have passed away. The options \"bodycam,\" \"home,\" and \"coffin\" do not make sense in this context. A coffin is a container used for burial, but it is not a service. A graveyard is a place where people are buried, but it is not a service either. A funeral, however, is a ceremony or service that is held to honor and remember the life of the deceased, and it typically involves the preparation of the body for burial or cremation. Therefore, the correct answer is funeral."}

Row houses are a type of housing commonly found in cities, suggesting that the people needed to move to a city in order to live in row houses. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

A toolbox and tool kit may already have a saw, but if it needs to be replaced or upgraded, a hardware store is a likely location to purchase a new one. A logging camp may have saws, but it is unlikely to be a retail location for purchasing them. An auger is a different type of tool used for drilling, and not relevant to the question."}

It is important to think before asking a question to avoid contaminating the scene or causing harm to the investigation. Touching everything or giving clues could potentially disturb evidence or interfere with the investigation, so these options are unlikely. Expressing information and analyzing may be part of the investigation process but thinking is the crucial first step."}

The sentence suggests that the man did not excel academically in college, but that he had fond memories of spending time with his fraternity brothers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"stagnation\" means lack of activity or movement, which is often used to describe a team that is not performing well or making progress. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "b399f6008d90dbd92bcce5abed4c1fd1", "question": {"question_concept": "goods", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "mall"}, {"label": "B", "text": "grocery store"}, {"label": "C", "text": "grocery store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "shop"}, {"label": "E", "text": "supermarket"}], "stem": "Where would you go if you want to buy some clothes?"}}, "k": "shop\nKnowledge: The question is asking for a place to buy clothes, which suggests that the correct answer should be a store that specializes in clothing. The options \"grocery store\" and \"supermarket\" are unlikely to sell clothing, so they can be eliminated. The word \"mall\" is a general term for a large shopping center that may contain clothing stores, but it is not a specific store that sells clothing. \"Shop\" is the most likely answer because it is a general term for a store that sells a specific type of goods, and many shops specialize in clothing."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "80c19c62338edae0e8a1f5c6fec0d29a", "question": {"question_concept": "food", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "etna"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cupboard"}, {"label": "C", "text": "oven"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stomach"}, {"label": "E", "text": "fridge"}], "stem": "Where is food likely to stay dry?"}}, "k": "cupboard\nKnowledge: A cupboard is typically used for storing dry foods, such as cereals, snacks, and pasta. The sentence implies that the location being referred to is intended for keeping food in a dry state, which makes a cupboard the most likely option. The other options, such as the oven or fridge, are commonly used for preparing or storing food but do not necessarily keep it dry. Etna and stomach are also not relevant to the question."}

The term \"effectively treated\" is also a possibility, but \"managed\" seems like a more accurate description of the situation presented. The other options, such as \"recur,\" \"cause delusion,\" and \"illusion,\" have no connection to the context of the sentence."}

A case provides a layer of padding and protection that can prevent scratches and other types of damage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A bank is not relevant to keeping a musical instrument safe, while an orchestra and music room are places where instruments are played and stored, but do not address the issue of protection. A movie is also not relevant to the topic."}

The context implies that she may be stressed or overwhelmed, and is using television as a form of escapism. The option \"entertainment\" could be a possible answer, but it is too broad and does not capture the specific intention of the woman's actions. The options \"falling asleep\", \"getting fat\", and \"crying\" do not make sense in relation to the context."}

A gazelle is a type of antelope that is typically found in open plains and savannas in Africa, which makes \"open plain\" the most likely choice. The other options do not have any connection to the natural habitat of a gazelle."}

Stretches involve slow, deliberate movements, and learning to walk is a process that takes time and involves a slower pace. Running from the police is a specific and illegal action, and getting out of bed may involve a quick movement but does not necessarily involve a fast pace."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "6b1f5ebd9d0dbc7e34a598456a6091a8", "question": {"question_concept": "free", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "slavery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "caught"}, {"label": "C", "text": "caged in"}, {"label": "D", "text": "topfree"}, {"label": "E", "text": "prisoner"}], "stem": "It's dangerous to let pet birds free so it's better to keep them what?"}}, "k": "caged in\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that keeping pet birds free can be dangerous, so the best option is to keep them confined in some way to ensure their safety. The word \"caged\" is the most appropriate choice here, as it suggests that the birds are being kept in a secure enclosure rather than being allowed to roam free. The other options have negative connotations and would not be appropriate in this context."}

Therefore, it is likely that their supplies come from a wooded area nearby. British Columbia is a geographic location and not relevant to the question. Body of water is a general term and not specific to the context of the question. Paying debts and zoos have no connection to beaver behavior."}

He's not good at it because he suffers from what?"}}, "k": "panic\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Zane struggles with answering questions, and the word \"suffers\" implies that it causes him distress or difficulty. Panic is a common response to situations that cause anxiety, stress, or fear, so this choice is the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they neither describe a negative response to answering questions nor explain why Zane might struggle with it."}

This phrase typically refers to speaking openly to the media or sharing their story on social media. In this case, the question implies that the benefit of doing so is something that the celebrity gains, rather than the public or society as a whole. Among the given answer choices, \"press coverage\" is the option that directly relates to this idea. The other choices either do not make sense in the context or are unlikely to be seen as a benefit for a celebrity."}

They all remained in their seats, because it would have been dangerous to try to find there way out.  Where mihgt they have been?"}}, "k": "opera\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the situation occurred in a public gathering space, likely a theater or opera house. The use of the word \"seats\" indicates that they were in a venue that had assigned seating, rather than a private home or outdoor location like the Grand Canyon. The options \"basement\" and \"bedroom\" also do not fit the context of the sentence, leaving \"opera\" and \"concert\" as the most likely options. However, the sentence specifically mentions an opera, so that would be the correct choice."}

In a family tree, the different branches of a family tree are indicated by different limbs. Adding a \"niece limb\" would indicate the new addition to the family, who would be the daughter of the person's brother. The other options are not related to the concept of mapping out relationships between family members."}

The other options (willing, optional, have to, and unnecessary) do not fit in the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information provided."}

Squids are not typically used to write with, newspaper and printer are not items used to directly write with, and a pencil case is used to store writing instruments such as pencils and pens, but not to write with directly. Fountain pens, on the other hand, are writing instruments that use ink cartridges or are refillable with ink to allow for smooth and consistent writing."}

This shock was likely caused by something unexpected happening. The word \"surprised\" fits this context because it means to be caught off guard by something unexpected, which is consistent with the sentence. The other options, such as \"wanted\" or \"calm\", do not make sense in this context because they do not fit the feeling of surprise that is being described. \"Thundershock\" is not a commonly used word and does not fit the typical way that surprise is described."}

The other options don't make sense in the context of meeting a friend, except for conversation which is a possibility but not mentioned in the sentence as a specific action done by the person. A handshake is a common way to greet someone without physical touch beyond a handclasp, making it the most likely answer."}

The options given are all different types of locations, but the context of the sentence suggests that it would be a place where travelers might stop for a break or to refuel. Gas stations are commonly found along highways and have maps available for purchase or sometimes for free. The other options may have maps available as well, but they are not typically associated with travelers stopping for directions or assistance."}

The phrase \"exchanging ideas\" is a common way to describe a conversation or discussion between people where they share their thoughts and opinions. The other options, such as confusion, peer pressure, response, and learning, do not necessarily suggest that Sage enjoyed communicating with his peers in this way."}

A comfortable chair or window sill may also be a place where a cat likes to perch, but it doesn't necessarily suggest snuggling with a human, whereas a bed is a common place where people and their pets sleep together."}

Substations are vital to the distribution of electricity across a city or region, and typically have large power lines and cables hanging overhead. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While cars can travel quickly on many different types of roads and tracks, a freeway is a type of highway designed specifically for high speed travel with limited access points and no interruptions from other vehicles or pedestrians. The other options either have slow speed limits, obstructions, or are not designed for high speed travel."}

The context of the sentence implies that the man with the suitcase full of money is a character in a movie, rather than a real-life situation. The other options (subway, airplane, baggage compartment, cargo hold) are real-life scenarios in which a person might encounter a man with a suitcase, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as \"movie.\""}

{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "33d023a6806390eb8195380331e17404_1", "question": {"question_concept": "reception desk", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "motel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hostel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "building"}, {"label": "D", "text": "lobby"}, {"label": "E", "text": "office park"}], "stem": "If somebody is working at a reception desk, they are located at the front entrance of the what?"}}, "k": "lobby\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the location referenced is a place where people are greeted or checked in upon entering. This is commonly found in a lobby, which is typically the area immediately inside the entrance of a building, such as a hotel or office. The other options do not have the same connotation of being a location where people are received upon entering."}

A roster is a list of names of individuals who are part of a certain group or organization, so in this context, it makes sense to put the person's name on a roster to recognize their achievement. The other options, such as a certificate or phone book, do not necessarily have a direct connection to recognition or accomplishment."}

The suburbs are often known for having good schools while still being outside of the city. The other options, such as woods, bed, rural, and neighborhood, do not necessarily have a strong correlation with good schools."}

The capitol building is the main headquarters for the U.S. Congress and is where senators and representatives spend a significant amount of their time working. Washington D.C. is also a plausible answer since it is the location of the capitol building, but the other options are not relevant to the sentence's context."}

Running away or hurrying along would not be appropriate responses to a cry for help. Fine motorists and direct traffic are options that do not match the context of the sentence, as they have nothing to do with responding to a cry from a distance.

The phrase \"begin work\" is the most logical answer because it's the only choice that directly relates to starting a job. \"Take care of proposals\" suggests a more administrative role, \"in charge of project\" suggests a leadership role, \"eat cake\" is unrelated and \"go to school\" is likely irrelevant in this context."}

The option \"tall building\" directly relates to the concept of height, while the other options do not. \"Go down\" is a phrase that does not make sense in the context of the question. \"Apartment building\" and \"office building\" do not necessarily imply height - they can come in a range of sizes. \"Cabin\" usually implies a smaller, more rustic type of lodging, which again does not connect to the concept of height."}

Rebirth may be a belief held by some religions, but it is not a common or universal practice. Decomposition technically occurs after death, but it is not something that humans do intentionally to other humans. Burial, on the other hand, is a common and traditional practice in many cultures, and involves placing the body in a grave or tomb."}

Many hotels have a directory or information booklet that includes details about the various amenities and services available, including restaurants on the hotel property. The yellow pages and business sector may have listings for restaurants, but they may not always include phone numbers. The option of \"town\" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information on where to find the phone number."}

Additionally, they are specifically looking for a bald eagle. Given that bald eagles are a national symbol of the United States, it is likely that the person is hoping to capture an image of the bird as an expression of patriotism. Therefore, the correct answer is photograph. The other options (city, Canada, Minnesota, and thermal) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The options \"neighbor's house\" and \"drawing room\" would not be feasible as they do not provide access to a piano. \"Lunch\" is an unrelated word and cannot be the answer. A music school or music store would likely have a piano available for use or rent, making them the most relevant options."}

The word \"partner\" is commonly used to refer to someone in a romantic relationship, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context - \"anus\" is not typically associated with kissing, \"arousal\" is a physical state that may or may not be present during kissing, while \"trust\" and \"cooperation\" are important in any relationship, but not necessarily specific to romantic ones."}

This helps them to introduce themselves and participate in classroom activities. While learning to count and socialize are also important skills for young children, they are not typically considered prerequisites for attending school. Dressing oneself and keeping a clean room are household tasks that may be encouraged, but are not necessarily related to school preparation."}

The other options are either irrelevant or counterproductive during a job interview. Small talk may be appropriate to build rapport, but it is not the main focus. Friendship and social life are personal topics that are not relevant to the job interview. Getting tired of the interviewer is certainly not an advisable approach."}

The serpent convinced Eve to eat the fruit, and she then convinced Adam to eat it as well, leading to their expulsion from the garden and the introduction of sin and suffering into the world.

The option \"apartment building\" fits this description, as it is a type of housing where residents often share common areas and interact with each other. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Opening doors for others is a common example of this type of behavior, as it shows respect for the other person and acknowledges their needs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of kindness."}

Making money is a common purpose of going to work. The other options, such as \"cross street\" or \"falling down,\" do not make sense in the context of work. \"Draw attention to themselves\" could be a possible answer, but it is less likely because it is not always the main purpose of work. \"Come home\" is also not a correct answer because it describes the end of the workday, rather than what a person does during work."}

Where might he have been?"}}, "k": "south carolina\nKnowledge: The clue in the sentence is that John was glad to be on the east coast. The options given are all US states or regions, and only South Carolina is on the east coast. The other options are either inland or in the west, so they do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "07a99d5f2ca7028febeb9f09604b36c8", "question": {"question_concept": "mice", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "loft"}, {"label": "B", "text": "attic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bell cat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "countryside"}, {"label": "E", "text": "laboratory"}], "stem": "Name a location where you would not want to find mice."}}, "k": "laboratory \nKnowledge: Laboratories are typically used for scientific and medical purposes where cleanliness and hygiene are crucial. Mice present a risk of contamination and can affect the accuracy of experiments, making it an undesirable place to find them. The other options, such as loft and attic, are commonly known locations where mice may be found but do not have the same association with cleanliness and precision as a laboratory."}

The other options all suggest negative outcomes or side effects of jogging, which would not be desired by someone who is trying to improve their health."}

The options \"book\" and \"manual\" are unlikely, as people are not likely to consult physical books or manuals for information on their phones. \"Google\" is a search engine that can be used on the internet, so it is a potential answer. \"Online\" is a bit redundant, as the internet is an online platform, but it is still a potential answer. Therefore, \"internet\" is the most likely correct answer."}

Beef stew might include potatoes as well, but the word \"soup\" indicates that the correct answer is a liquid dish. \"Own kitchen,\" \"kitchen cabinet,\" and \"pantry\" are not types of soup and have no relevance to the question."}

The word \"encouraging\" implies that the coach was optimistic and supportive, and the phrase \"positive coach\" suggests that the coach had a positive outlook on the person's abilities. The other options, such as \"pity,\" do not fit the context of the sentence as they imply a negative view of the person's disability."}

The correct spelling is \"practice\" with a \"c\" when used as a noun, and \"practise\" with an \"s\" when used as a verb in some British English contexts. The other options, such as \"park,\" \"fact,\" and \"practical,\" do not fit the context of the sentence."}

If you are below the object, you are looking up at it as it rises. The other options do not accurately describe the position of an observer in relation to an object that is rising."}

Putting the food can in a cabinet or house wouldn't make sense, and putting it in a recycling center is not relevant to the context of the sentence. The last option, \"make person sick,\" is not a logical place to put a food can. Therefore, the only logical option that fits with preparing for a hike would be putting the food can in a backpack."}

The other options do not correspond to the function or location of a doormat. Persia is a region known for producing rugs, but it is not a location where one would keep a rug near a front door. A desk or table would not be appropriate locations for a doormat, and the living room is not typically where one would place a doormat."}

The other choices are not relevant to getting food in the context of the question. The word \"table\" refers to a piece of furniture used for eating, while \"Disneyland\" is a theme park and has no connection to getting food. \"Refrigerators\" and \"pantry\" are places where food is stored, but they do not necessarily indicate a means of obtaining food."}

Instead, he just continued to do what?"}}, "k": "lie down\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Brad was unable to get out of bed, so instead he continued to do something that he was already doing, which is lying down. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence; if Brad was trying to get out of bed, he would not go down or sit down, and falling down implies a loss of balance or control that is not indicated in the sentence. Lying to himself may be possible, but it is not suggested in this particular sentence."}

In the context of the question, it suggests that the heifer in question is of high quality, meaning she has desirable traits, such as good genetics or a healthy body. Taking a heifer to a cattle show would be the logical option in this case, as these events are often used to showcase and compare the best animals in a given breed or category. The other options, such as taking her home or to a dairy farm, do not necessarily imply that the heifer is particularly high quality or show-worthy."}

Where might he look for one?"}}, "k": "train station\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill is looking for a responsible stranger with kids, which implies that he is possibly looking for a nanny or a babysitter. The train station is a logical choice since it is a transportation hub and people with children often take trains for long-distance travel.

The other options either have no clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not likely to be positive outcomes.

What might he hardest do dust?"}}, "k": "under the bed\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John wants to clean all the dust out of his place before watching TV, implying that the TV is not the hardest place to dust. The closet, attic, and most buildings are too general to be considered specific places to dust. However, the phrase \"settling down\" implies that John wants to be comfortable while watching his favorite shows, so it is likely that he will focus on cleaning the area close to his seating arrangement, which could include the space under the bed. Therefore, it is most likely that the hardest place John will have to dust is under the bed."}

The word \"common\" implies that this is not an unusual occurrence and happens frequently. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"Profane\" means disrespectful, \"halibut\" is a type of fish, and \"damaged\" does not fit with the emotional tone of the sentence."}

Therefore, if a person wants no neighbors, they would choose to live in an area where there are no other houses or apartments nearby. The only option that fits this criterion is \"woods,\" which suggests a location in a forest or wooded area, far away from other housing developments. The other options all involve living near other people or in built-up areas."}

Boredom is a common reason for students to feel sleepy during class. Malaria is a tropical disease caused by parasites, and it is unlikely for someone to have malaria while attending school. Graduate is a term used to describe successfully completing a degree program, which does not relate to the context of the sentence.

The options \"orchestra,\" \"church,\" and \"Chinese temple\" may have gongs, but it is unlikely that they would sell them. \"Chinatown\" may have stores that sell gongs, but it is not a reliable option. \"Music store\" is the best option because they specialize in selling musical instruments, and it is likely that they carry gongs."}

It was what game after that he hated.  The time, the sore feet. He did not like doing what?"}}, "k": "standing in line\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John has no problem with waiting in a line, but it is the game after that he dislikes due to time and sore feet. This suggests that John may not enjoy standing for long periods of time, which is necessary when waiting in a line.

Therefore, a story about this event would be set in the past, not the future or present. The other answer choices, such as book or library, book or magazine, and newspaper, are irrelevant to the question as they do not indicate a specific time period."}

They are adapted to high altitudes and cooler temperatures, which is why they prefer mountainous environments. The other options, such as wood piles, jungle, petting zoos, and animals, do not provide a suitable habitat for marmots."}

What might they do instead to achieve better outcomes?"}}, "k": "think\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that people make assumptions that are not based on logic or reason, but rather on their biases or preconceived notions. To achieve better outcomes, they should engage in critical thinking and analyze situations objectively before making any assumptions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - setting a table or playing games, for example, would not have any impact on a person's ability to make informed assumptions. Lying is also not a suitable option, as it would only exacerbate the problem. Reading books, on the other hand, could be helpful in expanding a person's knowledge and challenging their assumptions."}

Walking and playing basketball require space and movement that is not possible in a car. Playing chess requires a board and pieces, which may not be practical to bring on a car trip. Watching television may not be available in every car and can also cause motion sickness for some people. However, listening to music can easily be done with headphones or through the car's sound system and does not require much physical movement."}

A brass band is a type of musical ensemble that consists of brass instruments, including trumpets, as well as percussion. The other options do not specifically refer to brass instruments or ensembles."}

The term \"getting\" often implies receiving something in return, which rules out options like asking for or work. The option food is also unlikely since it is uncommon for employers to provide food as a form of compensation. Energy may be a plausible choice depending on the context, but the speaker's use of the term \"you boss\" implies a professional relationship, suggesting that money is the most probable answer."}

San Francisco is a location, not a place to buy fresh fruit. A refrigerator is a household appliance and not a place to purchase fruits. A big box retailer may sell fruits, but they may not necessarily be fresh. A tree is a natural source of fruit, but it does not specify where to find it. On the other hand, a market is a common place where fresh fruits are sold."}

A meeting is a common setting for collaboration and discussion in many workplaces, whereas the other options (desk, office, table, work) do not necessarily imply that other people will be involved in the consultation process."}

What might have he been doing?"}}, "k": "playing marbles\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that whatever Stark was doing, it was harmless and enjoyable. Playing marbles is a common pastime that fits this description, whereas painting nails, constructing, and wild rides could potentially be more dangerous or require more effort. Needing rest is also not a likely activity to be described as \"having fun.\" Therefore, playing marbles is the most likely answer."}

Indigestion is a common after-effect of eating heavy, high-fat meals like hamburgers. 'Tasty' might be a potential choice for a positive effect of eating a hamburger, but the sentence specifically asks for an immediate consequence, and 'tasty' does not fit this criterion. 'Health problems' and 'gain weight' are possible longer-term consequences of regularly consuming fast food like hamburgers, but they don't fit the immediate timeframe requested in the question. 'Eat cake' is not even a consequence, but an alternative suggestion that is not related to the question."}

It is common for cupboards to have doors that hide the contents inside, including any shelves that may be present. The other options, such as a refrigerator, bookstore, school building, or wardrobe, are unlikely to have a shelf hidden behind a door as they serve different purposes and do not typically have a layout that would accommodate such a feature."}

Since motor oil is typically associated with cars, it is likely that the man was in his garage, where he would keep his car and car-related tools and supplies. The other options (hardware store, utility room, wishing well, laundry) do not fit with the context of the sentence."}

Ice packs are typically used for temporary cooling, and are not a long-term storage solution. That leaves freezer and refrigerator as the two most likely options. However, the word \"kind\" suggests that the question is asking for a more specific type of cold storage, and refrigerators are typically designed for storing food and beverages at a cool but not frozen temperature, while freezers are designed for long-term storage of frozen food. Therefore, the best answer is refrigerator."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "ef6ede0af827ddd1dc7bbeb36a6fdd22", "question": {"question_concept": "restaurant", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "big city"}, {"label": "B", "text": "town"}, {"label": "C", "text": "small town"}, {"label": "D", "text": "canada"}, {"label": "E", "text": "yellow pages"}], "stem": "Where could you go to between 1000 and 10000 restaurant?"}}, "k": "big city\nKnowledge: The question is asking for a location where a high number of restaurants can be found, specifically between 1000 and 10000. It is unlikely that a small town or a town would have that many restaurants, and Canada is too large of an area to provide a specific location. Yellow pages is a directory and not a location. Big cities, on the other hand, are known for having a large number of restaurants due to their high population density and diverse cultures. Therefore, the correct answer is big city."}

It is less likely to be found in an arena or concert hall where the space is more open and there may not be a dedicated platform for a statue. Museums may have statues on display, but they may also be displayed on a pedestal or platform. Therefore, the most likely answer is \"building.\""}

Art supplies is a logical option as round brushes are commonly used for painting and other artistic mediums. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence as they all relate to hair and grooming."}

Additionally, the fact that the teen's parents think he is bored implies that he is not doing anything highly stimulating or active, making choices like lifting weights or playing chess less likely. The option to \"meet interesting people\" also doesn't make sense in this context as the teen is described as staying in bed, which is a private setting."}

Given the context of the sentence and the choices available, the most likely negative health outcome is heartburn which can be caused by eating hamburger (a greasy meat) without taking antacids or other medications to prevent acid reflux. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Democracy is a type of government, not the entity that the government should work for. Canada is a country, not the entity that the government should work for. Civilization is a broad term that can encompass many different nations and societies, and tax office is a specific department within a government, not the entity that the government should work for."}

The word \"feline\" refers to a cat, so it is not a plausible answer. \"Sharp claws\" is a characteristic of cats, but it does not relate to the question at hand. \"Pussycat\" is another word for cat, so it is not a viable option either. Therefore, the correct answer is \"thirsty,\" as cats also require water to drink."}

The word \"silent\" is the best fit as it means \"free from sound or noise\" and accurately describes a room where no other noise is present. \"Opera,\" \"television,\" and \"elevator\" are not related to the context of the question, and \"silence\" is a repetition of the word \"silent\" without adding any clarity or new information."}

Therefore, the best answer is \"America\" since it is a country and is well-known for its fast food industry."}

This is a common feature of public buildings, such as office buildings or shopping malls. The other options, such as a tomb, arena, access rooms, or house, do not typically have elevators that would require a central passage to access."}

A cellar is typically a cool, dark, and dry space that can be used for food storage. The other options, such as a farmer's market, grocery bag, pantry, and fridge, are not likely places for a potato to be stored long-term. A bushel basket may be used for storing potatoes, but it is not as specific as the given context of a cellar."}

The objective of networking is usually to establish relationships that can lead to new opportunities, partnerships or collaborations. Building trust is therefore an important aspect of networking, as it helps to establish credibility and creates a foundation for future interactions.

The options \"hospital\" and \"cabinet\" are not typically associated with personal clothing storage, and the option \"home\" is too broad and vague to be a useful answer. \"Chest\" could be a possible answer, but \"dresser drawers\" is a more specific and common location for storing clothing items like linens and socks."}

Therefore, it makes sense that someone would want to relax once they've finished their work. \"Frustration\" does not fit the context because it suggests that the person had a difficult time creating the art. \"Eat\" and \"communication\" do not follow from the context provided. \"Enlightenment\" could be a possible answer if the context suggested that the art had some spiritual or philosophical significance."}

The options \"get dirty\" and \"writing\" have no relevance to cleaning clothes. \"Use water\" is necessary for cleaning clothes, but not sufficient on its own. The options \"launder\" and \"soap\" are both methods commonly used for cleaning clothes, but \"launder\" specifically refers to the process of washing and cleaning clothes."}

This means that the shrink ray did the opposite of what was intended, causing the person to become larger rather than smaller. Therefore, the correct answer is \"grow.\" The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence."}

What was Christine?"}}, "k": "adult\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Christine is too old to be having a baby, which implies that she is an adult. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - \"begin to talk\" and \"girl\" do not have any clear connection, while \"old person\" and \"old man\" imply a much older age than what is suggested by the sentence."}

What might be play in?"}}, "k": "marching band\nKnowledge: The word \"percussion\" is commonly associated with marching bands and orchestras, which frequently use drums and other percussion instruments as part of their musical arrangements. Music stores and own homes may have percussion instruments available, but the focus on playing in \"something\" suggests a larger, organized group such as a band or orchestra. Parties may also feature live music, but it is less likely that a percussion instrument would be the featured instrument at a party."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "7044d82a456d0fa6f0210abb03cbf2c4", "question": {"question_concept": "playing ball", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "losing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "competition"}, {"label": "C", "text": "having fun"}, {"label": "D", "text": "win"}, {"label": "E", "text": "injury"}], "stem": "If I'm playing ball, I'm mostly trying to do what?"}}, "k": "having fun\nKnowledge: The context of playing ball suggests that the activity is being done for leisure or entertainment. While competition and winning may be motivations for some individuals, the word \"mostly\" implies that the primary goal is enjoyment. Losing and injury do not align with the idea of having fun, and are unlikely to be the intended answer."}

This concept of fairness is emphasized by the fact that cheating and sabotage are mentioned as incorrect choices. Practice and in competition are both related to the act of competing, but do not necessarily address the need for fairness in the competition."}

It is valued for its smooth texture and lustrous sheen, making it a popular choice for formal wear such as dresses, suits, and blouses. Jean and parachutes are made from different materials, and mulberry trees are the source of silk production but not items that display it directly in a noticeable way. Expensive clothing is a broad category that can include different types of items, but garments specifically refer to pieces of clothing that cover the body."}

A library is a place where one can access a vast amount of information and resources in the form of books, journals, and other materials. The other options do not offer the same level of access to information as a library. A park is a recreational area; a meeting is a gathering of people; the internet is a vast network of data and communication, but it is not curated in the same way as a library; a book is a single source of information, not a large collection."}

The most logical place for a resume to go in an office setting would be on the office desk, where the receptionist could easily file it or pass it along to the appropriate person. The other options (file cabinet, nightstand, kitchen cabinet, the floor) do not make sense in the context of a job application."}

This is because the human body requires a certain balance of salts and minerals in the bloodstream, which would be disrupted if water were injected into the body. The other options do not make sense in this context."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "26c854d933d2115e7636fdcde57eb463", "question": {"question_concept": "playing baseball", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fame"}, {"label": "B", "text": "errors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "strikes"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sore muscles"}], "stem": "Athletes soak in hot tubs to relieve what after playing baseball?"}}, "k": "sore muscles\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that the athletes are playing baseball, a physically demanding sport that can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. The phrase \"soak in hot tubs\" suggests that the athletes are attempting to alleviate this discomfort, which is a common reason why people use hot tubs. The other options (fame, errors, strikes) do not seem related to the context of the sentence."}

One option stands out as a negative outcome, which is losing money. Playing cards, poker, and doubling winnings are activities that could result in either winning or losing, so they do not necessarily explain the gambler's unhappiness. Similarly, winning the prize would typically result in happiness, so this option is also unlikely to be correct."}

Most people know that vegetables are good for you, as they are high in essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the health benefits of vegetables."}

They were what?"}}, "k": "unacquainted\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John did not recognize the lady, which suggests that they were not acquainted. The other options, such as \"pay debts,\" \"slender,\" \"free flowing,\" and \"sparse,\" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

While it does provide warmth and heat, these are not the ultimate responsibility of the sun. A sun tan is a result of exposure to the sun's rays, but it is not a fundamental role of the sun. Light is also a result of the sun's energy, but again, it is not the ultimate responsibility of the sun."}

She longed to see distant places. Where might she imagine going?"}}, "k": "Europe \nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Mandy has a desire to see distant places, which suggests that the correct answer may be a location that is far from her current location. The options \"downtown area\" and \"centre of town\" do not necessarily indicate a far distance. The option \"bedroom\" is also incorrect as it is not a location that Mandy can travel to. The options \"Europe\" and \"big city\" both suggest a far distance, but \"Europe\" is more specific and aligns better with the idea of distant places."}

He probably lives in what sort of place."}}, "k": "woodland\nKnowledge: Squirrels are typically found living in woodland areas, as they are arboreal animals that require trees to climb and nest in. The other options do not make sense because Joe is a wild animal that would not be found in a pet store or cafe, and would not survive in the ocean. Though squirrels can sometimes be found in urban areas or parks, \"outside\" is too vague to be a correct answer."}

A conservatory is a type of room or greenhouse specifically designed for growing plants, making it the most likely option for a personal ficus to thrive. The other options do not provide the necessary conditions for a ficus, as they are either outdoor environments or lack the necessary humidity and light sources."}

The other options are unlikely and do not fit the context of the sentence. Shallow waters or a pond arena would not make sense as a place to present legal evidence, and sea world and a poker game also do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

It is where the President typically issues official decrees, executive orders, and other important statements. Banning snakes would require a formal government decision, and the White House would likely be the location where such a decision would be made. The other options, such as a street, tropical forest, or Garden of Eden, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. New Mexico may be a possible location for snakes, but it does not have any relevance to where the ban would be issued."}

Additionally, the presence of a dictionary alongside other writings suggests that this is a location where people come to read and borrow books, which is a characteristic of a library. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Exercise is a critical component of improving one's physical fitness and is often recommended by healthcare professionals to promote overall well-being. While the other options may be important for maintaining good health and feeling better, exercise is generally considered to be the most important factor when it comes to getting in shape."}

Water fountains are often used as decorative features in public spaces, such as parks and plazas, and they typically have jets that shoot water into the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The most appropriate answer in this case is \"calm,\" which is a direct opposite of hyperactivity. The other options, such as \"park\" or \"safe,\" do not relate to the context of the sentence and would not help address the child's hyperactivity. \"Being good\" and \"good behavior\" are too general and do not specify an appropriate action to address hyperactivity."}

How did he usually do it?"}}, "k": "with brush\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John has a passion for painting houses, which implies that he is using a brush to apply paint onto the surfaces of the houses. The other options (clothes get stained, wallpaper, electrical circuit, draw) do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not have any clear connection to the act of painting houses."}

Out of the choices given, only \"living room\" is a common area found in a typical home entrance. \"A chair\" and \"bathroom\" are not typically found in home entrances, while \"school\" would not be relevant to the context of wiping feet on a doormat. \"Doorway\" is a possible answer, but it is not as specific as \"living room\" and could refer to any entrance."}

The library of congress and synagogue are unlikely choices for storing individual books while traveling. Pocket could work depending on the size of the book, but the most practical option for transporting a book would be either a backpack or suitcase. In this context, backpack is likely a better choice as it is more portable and easier to access while on the move."}

The given options are not the actual location of the gazelle, but rather a distraction. Knowing that a dictionary contains words arranged alphabetically and starting with the respective letter can help in selecting the correct answer in this case."}

Winning can bring great highs, such as a sense of accomplishment, pride, and recognition. Losing can bring great lows, such as disappointment, frustration, and a sense of failure. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The moon, on the other hand, is known to block sunshine during a solar eclipse. Therefore, the correct answer is moon."}

Among the choices provided, only air conditioning is commonly used for this purpose. A fan may help circulate air, but it does not reduce the temperature, while getting wet may provide temporary relief but is not a practical solution. Additionally, the terms \"coolness\" and \"coldness\" are not typically used to refer to specific devices or methods for cooling a house."}

The other options do not have any relevant connection to the context of the question. A kitchen cupboard is unlikely to be used for storing pillowcases, and the option \"bedding store\" is incorrect as it suggests storing the pillowcase in a retail location rather than in a personal space. Finally, the option \"England\" is completely unrelated and does not provide any helpful information for answering the question."}

A farmhouse is a likely location for this, as it is commonly associated with rural settings where there are usually mice to be caught. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options such as space shuttle, theater, Indian restaurant, and bar do not have any clear connection to the context of silk purchasing."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "f09038444aeb1a048f04dedd5b97b769", "question": {"question_concept": "clavichord", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "living room"}, {"label": "B", "text": "parlor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "music hall"}, {"label": "D", "text": "music room"}, {"label": "E", "text": "museum"}], "stem": "Where is a teacher likely to keep her clavichord?"}}, "k": "music room\nKnowledge: A clavichord is a musical instrument, so it is likely that a teacher who owns one would keep it in a room specifically designated for music-related activities. The options \"living room\" and \"parlor\" are more general living spaces and not typically associated with specific activities. \"Music hall\" implies a larger public space, whereas a clavichord is usually a smaller instrument for personal use. \"Museum\" is not likely a place where someone would keep their personal instrument."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "0aa23ad1ba9f28bc3e0185237a7ce1cc", "question": {"question_concept": "briefcase", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "luggage store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "courtroom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "airport"}, {"label": "D", "text": "office building"}, {"label": "E", "text": "hand"}], "stem": "Where are you if your bieifcase is going through an x-ray machine?"}}, "k": "airport\nKnowledge: X-ray machines are commonly used in airports to scan and examine the contents of carry-on and checked baggage. The other options do not involve the use of x-ray machines for scanning."}

The mention of a \"strong foundation\" narrows down the answer choices to qualities that are commonly associated with stable relationships, such as trust. Trust is a fundamental aspect of any healthy relationship, and it would make sense for the couple to feel relaxed as they part ways if they have a strong level of trust in each other. The other options, such as partner, cooperation, bricks, or herpes, do not fit the context of the sentence or are irrelevant to the topic of relationships."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "bbe0a1ad733e5699f991ff91b3712a6f", "question": {"question_concept": "take bus", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "commute"}, {"label": "B", "text": "flying"}, {"label": "C", "text": "get somewhere"}, {"label": "D", "text": "travel"}, {"label": "E", "text": "go home"}], "stem": "Why would you take a bus to work?"}}, "k": "commute\nKnowledge: The word \"commute\" refers specifically to the act of traveling to and from work on a regular basis. The other options are more general and do not necessarily imply the regularity that is suggested by the word \"commute\". \"Flying\" implies air travel, which is not typically used for commuting. \"Get somewhere\" and \"travel\" could apply to any type of trip, not necessarily work-related. \"Go home\" implies the end of the workday, not the trip to work."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "9e5ce2b7d9eb404cdf8c7317dd0b5a59", "question": {"question_concept": "going fishing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "to see the fish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "have fun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "catching fish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "wet clothes"}, {"label": "E", "text": "killing"}], "stem": "If you are hungry and going fishing, why would you be going fishing?"}}, "k": "catching fish\nKnowledge: The question asks why someone who is hungry would go fishing, which implies that they are going fishing for food. The most logical reason to go fishing for food is to catch fish, which is the only option directly related to obtaining food from fishing. The other options are either unrelated to the goal of obtaining food or imply negative intentions towards the fish."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "ffde211723f55e9744f94cbc14488a23", "question": {"question_concept": "dogs", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fleas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat cake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "attack"}, {"label": "D", "text": "defend"}, {"label": "E", "text": "run fast"}], "stem": "Dogs are very loyal if they have a good owner, they will always what them?"}}, "k": "defend\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that dogs are loyal and protective of their owners, which is often expressed through their tendency to defend them. Dogs are well-known for their protective instincts, and this option fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options (fleas, eat cake, attack, run fast) are not consistent with the idea of loyalty and protection, and are therefore unlikely to be correct."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "5ff8b0deed53b9ff91d58bd5b6f85bdf", "question": {"question_concept": "farmer", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "seed plants"}, {"label": "B", "text": "plant seeds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "garden"}, {"label": "D", "text": "grow corn"}, {"label": "E", "text": "produce food"}], "stem": "What does a farmer need to do to make  a maze on his farm in the fall?"}}, "k": "grow corn\nKnowledge: The word \"maze\" suggests that the question is referring to a corn maze, which is a popular fall attraction on farms. To make a corn maze, the farmer would need to grow corn and then create a maze-like pattern within the cornfield. The other options do not relate to the creation of a corn maze."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "36f1ceeecde7abf99dab635239e12442", "question": {"question_concept": "hair", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "thin out"}, {"label": "B", "text": "grow in ear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fall out"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bulge"}, {"label": "E", "text": "composted"}], "stem": "For many males hair is a concern as they get older, it begins to what, causing a receding hairline?"}}, "k": "thin out\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that males experience changes in their hair as they age, specifically thinning hair which causes a receding hairline. The other options - growing hair in the ear or bulging - do not relate to hair loss or aging. \"Composted\" is not a relevant option in this context. \"Fall out\" could be a potential answer, but \"thin out\" is a more specific and accurate description of the hair loss process."}

It implies that someone can play poker have options what to do in the game such as thinking or betting, but the outcome is negative if one is not good at it, which is represented by losing money. The other options are not relevant to the context of playing poker poorly."}

It was the only ting he loved. He hated everyone else and was abrasive to most people, but he loved his snake.   How might you describe the snake?"}}, "k": "pet\nKnowledge: The sentence clearly states that John loved his snake, indicating that the snake is his pet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This implies that people need to do something to prevent this, such as watering the plants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The fact that the apples were picked from a tree outside of Fort Wayne suggests that the location is in close proximity to the city, reinforcing the likelihood that the answer is Indiana. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The options \"front porch,\" \"classroom\" and \"grocery store\" do not have any connection to religious services. \"Obesity\" is a medical term and does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

A cabinet is a type of container commonly used for storing film reels or tapes, making it the most likely choice. The other options do not make sense in this context. Clingfilm is used to wrap food, Disneyland is a theme park, and a cave is a natural formation, none of which would be a suitable place to store film. \"Movie\" is too broad and does not provide enough detail about where the film was found."}

Slaughterhouses are known for processing large numbers of animals and involve a significant amount of bloodshed during the process, making it the most likely option. Crime scenes and blood banks may have some blood spillage, but it is unlikely to be a large amount. Veins and needles are not locations and do not fit the context of the sentence."}

They told the architect that they felt it was a potential hazard given the ages of the people who would be using it.

The other options, such as actors, floors, or schools, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are less likely to involve levels or mezzanines."}

{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "449de58e919975867255218484a9fc89", "question": {"question_concept": "learning about world", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "enlightenment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "open mind"}, {"label": "C", "text": "confusion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "smartness"}, {"label": "E", "text": "anger"}], "stem": "If you want to learn about the world and understand the real reasons behind cultural norms and mores, you have achieved a sense of what?"}}, "k": "enlightenment\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the act of learning about the world and understanding cultural norms requires a certain level of intellectual or philosophical understanding beyond just being smart or having an open mind. Enlightenment is often associated with gaining deep insights and understanding about the nature of the world and one's place in it, which aligns with the goal of understanding cultural norms and mores. Confusion and anger do not accurately reflect the desired outcome, while having an open mind and being smart may be helpful but not sufficient on their own."}

The other options do not relate to the typical experience of going to see a play - sitting is a passive action that doesn't convey any particular meaning in this context, jobless is irrelevant, meeting someone is not necessarily a defining characteristic of seeing a play, and laughter is only one possible reaction to a play (others might include sadness, contemplation, or awe)."}

Ulcers, understanding, gaining knowledge, and happiness do not necessarily relate to the specific purpose of a trade school, which is to provide vocational or technical training."}

Name one thing that makes raising a baby difficult."}}, "k": "learn to walk\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joan was a baby and couldn't do many things, which is a common characteristic of infants. Learning to walk is one of the major developmental milestones of a baby and can cause challenges for parents such as safety concerns and constant supervision. The other options are not related to difficulties associated with raising a baby."}

The options hamshackle, pizza, and part of meal do not make sense in this context as they do not refer to storage or cooking. The options fridge and refrigerator are both valid choices as they are commonly used to store raw meats before they are cooked."}

The word \"screaming\" suggests that the kids are not behaving well, which may cause the adult to become stressed or frustrated. The other options do not fit as well because they do not capture the negative impact that running errands with screaming kids would have."}

He was being what?"}}, "k": "deceptive\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was not telling the whole truth and intentionally leaving out important details, which is a behavior commonly associated with being deceptive. Dishonesty, deceitfulness, and poker face all suggest more overt ways of misleading or withholding information, while imagination does not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "3f6157968fcf50d257ec3d8c729b7443", "question": {"question_concept": "committing murder", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "problems"}, {"label": "B", "text": "distress"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fear"}, {"label": "D", "text": "go to jail"}, {"label": "E", "text": "killer"}], "stem": "what does someone have that causes them committing murder?"}}, "k": "killer\nKnowledge: The question is asking for the cause of someone committing murder, and the answer \"killer\" suggests that the person may have a predisposition or tendency towards violent behavior. The other answer choices do not necessarily indicate a direct cause of murder, but rather potential contributing factors such as distress or fear. \"Go to jail\" is not a cause of committing murder, but rather a consequence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "4768aa28fa14569d830f8947565296c1", "question": {"question_concept": "leader", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "army"}, {"label": "B", "text": "battle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "wildlife"}, {"label": "D", "text": "country"}, {"label": "E", "text": "organization"}], "stem": "What kind of place has a leader?"}}, "k": "organization\nKnowledge: The word \"leader\" is commonly associated with groups or organizations that have a hierarchical structure. An army, for example, has a leader (usually a general), but it is not the only type of group that has one. A battle refers to a singular event, and while there may be leaders on both sides, the question is asking about a type of place, not an event. Wildlife and country do not necessarily have leaders, so the best answer is organization."}

Meeting friends is a social activity that can involve communication, but it is not a direct answer to the question. Open mouth and thank god are expressions that do not necessarily involve communication with others. The last option, die of cancer, is entirely unrelated to the question."}

Buying pork chops from a corner shop implies that you are likely in a more urban or suburban setting, as opposed to a rural or desert location. England, Kentucky, and Iowa are all places where one might find a town with corner shops, but the word \"desert\" does not fit the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as a boy's bedroom or own home, are also plausible but are more specific and may not always be accurate. The toy store option is unlikely as the car would have already been purchased and taken to the child's home. The house option is too general and could refer to any area within a house, making it an unlikely answer."}

Since the question is asking specifically about where fishermen can store their rods on a fishing trip, the most logical answer would be a fishing camp. The other options listed do not offer any specific storage options for fishing equipment."}

He wasn't concerned with things that weren't fun. For him having fun is the same as what?"}}, "k": "being happy\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that Danny values having fun over other things that are not fun, and that he is enjoying dancing and singing with his friends. The most reasonable choice that corresponds with his behavior and attitude is being happy. Injuries, glee, and jumping do not fit the context of the sentence, and while smiling may indicate happiness, it does not fully capture the idea that having fun is equivalent to being happy."}

This is a common scenario for office workers to gossip with their colleagues. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of an office setting where colleagues would be present to gossip with."}

The other options, such as pocket, cabinet, jar, or store, do not make sense in this context as they do not provide a suitable location for packaged nails. Container, on the other hand, is a logical choice since it generally refers to a receptacle used for storing or transporting objects, which can include packaged items."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "1510f5183095466e4fe41b82501a9dd0", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "lazy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "own house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "talented"}, {"label": "D", "text": "affluent"}, {"label": "E", "text": "reproduce"}], "stem": "What is a person who is good at sports considered?"}}, "k": "talented\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person being referred to is skilled in sports. The word \"talented\" is commonly used to describe someone who has a natural ability or proficiency in a particular area, such as sports. On the other hand, the options \"lazy\" and \"own house\" do not relate to someone's athletic ability, while \"affluent\" and \"reproduce\" do not fit with the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "1fcc547e4e6813afc1a66717248d6c62", "question": {"question_concept": "ridiculous", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "straightforward"}, {"label": "B", "text": "serious"}, {"label": "C", "text": "solemn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "somber"}, {"label": "E", "text": "funny"}], "stem": "The man acted ridiculous at the funeral, what attitude should he have taken?"}}, "k": "somber\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's behavior at the funeral was inappropriate and not in line with what is expected. Funerals are somber events, where people gather to mourn and pay their respects to the deceased. Therefore, the man should have acted somber, respectful, and serious in his demeanor. The other options do not reflect the appropriate attitude expected at a funeral."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "68a911b64dc943b5f81c0f8dec7faed7", "question": {"question_concept": "pencil sharpener", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "home"}, {"label": "B", "text": "library"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stationery store"}, {"label": "D", "text": "cabinet"}, {"label": "E", "text": "desk drawer"}], "stem": "The pencil sharpener was broken in the classroom, where did the teacher recommend the student go?"}}, "k": "stationery store\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the student needs a new pencil sharpener since the one in the classroom is broken. The most logical place to find a pencil sharpener would be a stationery store, which is a place that sells writing and office supplies. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as going home or searching in a desk drawer would not solve the problem of the broken pencil sharpener."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "92f423de9a556a66c3eb73e9ddf9399a", "question": {"question_concept": "desk", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "furniture store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "schoolroom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "patio"}, {"label": "D", "text": "office building"}, {"label": "E", "text": "library"}], "stem": "Where does a child likely sit at a desk?"}}, "k": "schoolroom\nKnowledge: The question is asking about where a child would sit at a desk, which implies an educational setting. The most likely place for a child to sit at a desk is in a schoolroom. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, as desks are not typically found in furniture stores or on patios, and children are not usually required to sit in an office building or library."}

The other options, such as getting tired or going into overtime, are possibilities during a soccer game, but they do not directly relate to the outcome of winning. Anger and fights may occur on occasion during a soccer game, but they are not a direct outcome of winning."}

These parks often have many different rides, attractions, and areas, making it difficult to find your way around without a map. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This could lead to frustration and tension, which often result in arguments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Boredom, headache, and exhaustion could potentially be consequences of doing too much housework alone, but they are not directly related to the lack of help from the husband. The option \"park\" is unrelated to the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "f74b7f268d3c190a13f99ede6d2359e1", "question": {"question_concept": "advertisement", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "web page"}, {"label": "B", "text": "store"}, {"label": "C", "text": "la ville"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bus"}, {"label": "E", "text": "email"}], "stem": "The advertisement came in the form of a pop-up, where did it appear?"}}, "k": "web page\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that the advertisement came in the form of a pop-up, which is a type of ad that appears suddenly on a web page. Pop-up ads are commonly associated with online advertisements, so the correct answer would be web page. The other options, such as store, bus, and email, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. \"La ville\" is a French phrase that means \"the city,\" but it does not provide any useful information in this context either."}

The other options are not locations where people typically reside."}

The word \"stranger\" also implies that the people in question are not familiar to the speaker. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "9b631734e72a0e559da153492c1e7894", "question": {"question_concept": "hearing testimony", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "take notes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "nodding"}, {"label": "C", "text": "change of heart"}, {"label": "D", "text": "writing down"}, {"label": "E", "text": "listening"}], "stem": "The juror was quite bored and zoning out but wanted to convey he was hearing testimony, so he just sat there doing what?"}}, "k": "nodding\nKnowledge: The sentence states that the juror was bored and zoning out, indicating that he was not actively engaged in taking notes or writing down anything. The phrase \"just sat there\" also implies a lack of action. However, the juror still wanted to convey that he was listening to the testimony, which could be achieved through nodding or other non-verbal cues indicating attentiveness. \"Change of heart\" is unrelated to the sentence, and \"listening\" is redundant as it has already been stated that the juror wanted to convey they were \"hearing testimony.\""}

The options of Atlantic Ocean and aquarium would not provide the individuals with the ability to try the blowfish as they are not locations where they can purchase or consume the fish. France and books have no relevance to the context of the question so the correct answer is fish market."}

The term \"thruway\" is often used to describe a major highway or roadway that is designed to provide direct and efficient travel between two points, making it the most applicable choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not describe a route or means of travel."}

A mall is a common location for a variety of stores and a popular shopping destination, including clothing stores. The other options are not typically associated with clothing stores, except for possibly a department store, but a department store may not have as many clothing options as a mall. A drawer is too small of a space to hold many stores, and a library is not a place for shopping."}

The options \"going too fast\" and \"go fast\" imply that the car was already functioning properly, while \"last several years\" does not make sense in the context of repairing a car. \"Honk the horn\" is not related to the car's functionality."}

A caregiver is a trained professional who provides assistance to individuals who require help with daily tasks due to age, illness, or disability. The other options (creativity, hatred, own house, much money) do not relate to the context of the question and are not relevant to the topic of caregiving."}

Hotels are the most likely option because guests often need to look up phone numbers for amenities and services within the hotel, and there may be phone books provided in each room for this purpose. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence."}

Additionally, the words \"countryside\" and \"rural area\" are very broad and could apply to many different environments, so they are less likely to be the correct answer."}

Therefore, the choice \"walk\" is the most plausible option. The other choices may be possible activities during a commute, but they do not align with the specific information given in the question. For example, \"driving\" is not applicable if the individual is described as walking, and \"being late\" is not an activity, but a consequence of poor time management."}

The option \"falling down\" is not likely to have a variety of flats to choose from as it implies a run-down or dilapidated area."}

The options tree, mulberry bush, chicken coop, and viking ship do not seem like appropriate habitats for rabbits or for weasels to burrow after prey. A rabbit warren, on the other hand, is known for its numerous tunnels and burrows, which may make it an ideal habitat for weasels to pursue their prey."}

Therefore, it is most likely to be found in an appliance store where household items are sold. The other options (sports stadium, dress emporium, hot room, football stadium) have no connection to the context of the sentence and do not suggest any possibility of finding a fan for a stove."}

She was worried but didn't want to go to the hospital. Where might she go instead?"}}, "k": "bedroom\nKnowledge: The context suggests that Jodie is experiencing a physical symptom and is hesitant to seek medical attention. In such a scenario, going to a calm and familiar place like the bedroom might help alleviate some of the anxiety and discomfort. The other options do not seem to offer a suitable alternative for seeking medical help."}

The other options do not make sense in this context or are negative connotations."}

However, the United States and American are not accurate because they do not refer specifically to Canada. Cage is also not relevant because it does not relate to the topic of the sentence. Therefore, Vancouver Island is the correct answer as it is a specific location in Canada where marmots can be found."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "95d1d968ee66b6054cbb16b58a7c6455", "question": {"question_concept": "reduce", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "reduction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "make larger"}, {"label": "C", "text": "augment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "gain weight"}, {"label": "E", "text": "expand"}], "stem": "The surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, it seemed girls no longer want to what?"}}, "k": "augment\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the surgeon's clients are reducing in number because girls no longer want to do something. The options \"reduction\" and \"make larger\" do not fit the context of the sentence since they describe actions rather than the desired outcome. \"Expand\" and \"gain weight\" are also unlikely options since they are not commonly associated with the work of a surgeon. \"Augment\" is the most logical choice since it refers to the process of enhancing or increasing something, which could describe the desired outcome of a surgical procedure for girls."}

People often read magazines to pass the time while waiting to see a healthcare professional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, the most likely place to find a \"made up\" fox is in a storybook, which is a collection of fictional stories. The other options such as woods, hen house, natural habitat, and back yard are all associated with real-life locations where one might find real foxes."}

This is a common practice in military training, where recruits are pushed beyond their physical and mental limits to prepare them for the rigors of military life. The other options, such as \"destroying\", \"raze\", \"mutilate\", and \"demolition\", do not accurately reflect the process of building up and tearing down in basic training."}

The leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach and was stuck.  Where might he have been trapped?"}}, "k": "table\nKnowledge: The sentence states that Billy leaped up to a place where the dog couldn't reach him and got stuck. Kennel, porch, backyard, and park do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, a table is a piece of furniture that Billy could have leaped onto and got stuck, especially if it was unstable or hard to get down from. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely table."}

They had two wonderful kids who weren't always well behaved.  They were light tough, though.  They felt it was a parent's job to do what?"}}, "k": "guide children\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Judy had a specific perspective on parenting, which is that guiding their children was a crucial part of their role as parents. While it is possible that they also believed in controlling their children's behavior to some degree, the emphasis on the children not always being well-behaved implies that they understood that children need guidance and support to grow and develop. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or are too vague to be a clear answer."}

This implies that the item was purchased with money, and therefore was paid for. The other options do not make sense in this context - \"deadly\" and \"expensive\" are not relevant to the cost status of a gift, while \"imprisoned\" and \"in prison\" are completely unrelated."}

However, choosing options like \"have sex\" or \"get laid\" is not necessarily a correct answer as it implies that the sole purpose of flirting is to have sexual encounters. Similarly, \"were lonely\" may be a reason why someone may flirt, but it is not a universal reason. \"Dance\" is also not a valid option as it has no clear connection to the context of the question."}

Where was he going?"}}, "k": "England\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions \"crossing the channel from France,\" which suggests that James was likely traveling by sea. The options \"river,\" \"television,\" and \"India\" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, while \"Europe\" is too broad and does not specify a specific destination. \"England\" is the only option that is geographically close to France and makes sense as a logical destination for a boat crossing the channel."}

This implies that they are not performing for an audience, but rather they are practicing their music. The other options (recording an album, holding a concert, playing music, and blaring) all involve playing music for some kind of audience or purpose, whereas practicing is something musicians do to improve their playing ability without any expectation of an audience."}

The option \"defend\" is a similar word to the one used in the sentence and therefore a likely correct answer. \"Run fast\" and \"ocean\" are completely unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. \"Bad breath\" is a non-sequitur and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. \"Attack\" fits the context and is a likely correct answer."}

Farmers may grow wheat in their fields, but they typically do not grind it themselves. Cereal packets contain processed grains that have already been ground and are ready for consumption. Bread is the end product of the wheat-grinding process, not the tool used to grind it. The countryside is not relevant to the question, as it does not provide any information about the process of making bread."}

The options \"airport,\" \"with the pilot,\" \"room,\" and \"clothing store\" do not make sense in this context. The most likely place to store a large satchel while flying would be in the luggage compartment, which is where most large bags are stored during a flight."}

Sweating and breathing heavily are also possible physical reactions to running, but tiredness is a more common and expected outcome of prolonged running. Laughter and embarrassment are unlikely responses to physical exertion."}

The choice \"using energy\" closely aligns with this idea, indicating that the person has been truly active and has burned through considerable amounts of energy. The other options such as sleep, sleeping, action, and in motion, can be considered the result of fatigue and not necessarily the cause of it."}

The most likely scenario where this could have happened is during a visit to a grocery store. The other options, such as \"new moon,\" \"play cards,\" \"read book,\" and \"see art,\" do not have any clear connection to the situation described in the sentence."}

The word \"queue\" also suggests waiting, making \"waiting\" the most likely answer. \"Time\" is also a logical option because it directly relates to waiting for an extended period. The other choices (\"frustration,\" \"hair,\" and \"patience\") are not related to the context of the sentence."}

What is it?"}}, "k": "breathlessness\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a physiological consequence that is unavoidable when running. Since running is a physical activity that requires exertion, it is logical to assume that the consequence is related to the respiratory system. Breathlessness or shortness of breath is a common symptom for runners, especially if they are running at high intensity or for a prolonged period. The other options, such as muscle bulk or calluses, are not physiological consequences of running. Falling down is a possible consequence of running but is not a physiological one. Increased heart rate is a partial consequence of running but not the only one."}

The reason for this is likely related to hygiene, as baths are a common way to wash away dirt and bacteria from the skin. The answer \"wet skin\" is the only choice that directly relates to the benefits of taking a bath in terms of hygiene. The other options, such as flooding or drowning, are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not typically have auditoriums. A theater is a common place where individual speakers may give lectures or performances to an audience. The use of the word \"single\" suggests that there is only one person speaking, further indicating that it is likely to be a theater rather than a place with a \"crowd\" or \"university campus.\" \"Lights\" and \"park\" do not clearly match the context of the sentence."}

The other options (locomotion, blisters, rollerskate, and exercise) are either unrelated or only tangentially related to the idea of progressing forward."}

The reference to the western citizens is likely a red herring to throw off the reader. The options \"space station\" and \"trash can\" are unlikely because they are not related to nature. The option \"bouquet of flowers\" is too small to contain a large group of bees, leaving \"field of flowers\" as the most appropriate and likely answer."}

She wanted to make sure that he couldn't get to it so she put it where?"}}, "k": "desk drawer\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that Miss Grady took a stick from Bob during class, which suggests that the location where she put the stick was likely within the classroom. The options \"kitchen drawer\" and \"office\" are unlikely because they suggest a location outside of the classroom. \"Pocket\" is also unlikely because it would not be a secure location if Miss Grady wanted to make sure that Bob could not get to it. Therefore, \"desk drawer\" is the most sensible option, as it is a secure location within the classroom."}

Genetic mutation refers to a change in DNA that can lead to variation in offspring, but it is not usually the mechanism by which reproduction occurs. Kissing, flirting, and going on a date may be part of the process leading up to reproduction, but they are not the actual act of reproduction itself."}

They might limit the time they children spend doing what?"}}, "k": "watch TV\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe and Jill are concerned about their children being inactive, which may lead to sedentary behavior. Watching TV is a common sedentary activity that involves sitting in one place for extended periods of time. Play sports, throw things, and playing with toys are all physical activities that would encourage movement and reduce sedentary behavior. Reading could be either sedentary or active, depending on the circumstances. However, the sentence specifically implies that Joe and Jill are worried about their children being sedentary, so watching TV is the best answer."}

The instructor mentions that the liquid should be above the cabbage, indicating that the cabbage should be fully submerged in the liquid to properly ferment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The dishwasher is where cups are cleaned after use, not where they are normally taken from to get a drink. The water fountain is a public drinking source that does not involve cups. The sand box and toilet are not appropriate places from which to take a cup."}

Therefore, the correct answer must be an action that would require clear explanation. \"Illustrate point\" is an action that requires clear communication and explanation, making it the correct answer. \"Cool off\" and \"write letter\" could be possible actions to take after calming down, but they do not necessarily require clear explanation. \"Get mad\" and \"destroy enemy\" do not align with the context and are too extreme in comparison to the other options."}

Jerusalem and Jewish neighborhoods are both associated with the Jewish faith and culture, so it's likely that they would have kosher restaurants. New York City has a large Jewish population and is known for its diverse food culture, so it's also likely to have kosher restaurants available. \"Dining in\" doesn't specify a location, but it generally refers to eating at home instead of at a restaurant, so it's a safe choice for an option that is unlikely to have a kosher restaurant."}

Therefore, it is more likely that the bald eagle would fly all over the Pacific Northwest rather than other geographic locations like Utah or the desert. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Sporting goods stores typically sell a range of outdoor equipment, including knives specifically designed for these types of activities. The other options (backpack, kitchen, sharp edges, dog house) are not places where you would commonly find knives suitable for outdoor use."}

The options \"cool house,\" \"gas or electric,\" and \"burn child\" are not accurate descriptions of what a stove does to the place it's in. While stoves can be used for cooking, the option \"brown meat\" does not capture the primary purpose of a stove, which is to generate heat. Therefore, \"warm room\" is the correct answer."}

Religious experiences and hallucinations may be related to trance in some contexts, but they are not necessarily the best ways to initiate the state. Loss of control and sleep may also be associated with trance, but they do not provide specific guidance on how to begin the process."}

It is unlikely that someone working on a work assignment would do so in a location like an internet cafe, which is a public space that may not provide the necessary level of privacy and security. A house or school may be possible locations, but an office building is the most likely option since it is a dedicated space for work-related activities. The option \"internet cafe\" is repeated and therefore, incorrect."}

The mention of horses dancing in circles is likely referring to a carnival or circus, which often feature horses performing in shows. The other options, such as night club, theater, and opera, do not have a clear connection to the context of horses dancing in circles. Ringmaster may be somewhat related, but it is not clear whether the context involves a circus or carnival."}

Where might James work?"}}, "k": "theater\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions an \"auditorium\" and a \"mezzanine\" which are both commonly associated with theaters. A mezzanine is a level intermediate between the main floor and the next higher floor, and is often found in theaters to provide additional seating. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Instead, they might want to stay in bed and relax. The other options may not be as appropriate because they do not necessarily promote rest and relaxation."}

In an apartment, a stove would typically be located in the kitchen, whereas in other options like a tent or car, this would not be the case. The living room and friend's house options are also unlikely locations for a stove, as they are not designated areas for cooking."}

Additionally, malls typically have a variety of stores and items available for purchase. Public places, banks, and supermarkets may also have revolving doors, but the presence of things to buy is more closely associated with a mall. New York is a city and does not inherently have a revolving door or things to buy in it."}

While books can be stored on a shelf or in a cabinet, they cannot be read there. Similarly, books cannot be read in a backpack or a sink. A table, however, is a surface commonly used for reading, studying, and writing, making it the most likely option for the correct answer."}

Animals in the wild typically need to forage for food and are not reliant on humans for their survival. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "0e5c7c0cec5b693e52f74f5f879d84fb", "question": {"question_concept": "crab", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "most offices"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fish department"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fancy restaurant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "government submarine"}, {"label": "E", "text": "chesapeake bay"}], "stem": "If you wanted a license to catch crabs, what government office would you go to?"}}, "k": "fish department\nKnowledge: The question is asking about obtaining a license to catch crabs, which suggests that the office responsible for granting such licenses would be related to fishing or marine life. The option \"fish department\" is the most relevant choice as it directly refers to an office that deals with fish and marine life. The other options, such as \"government submarine\" or \"fancy restaurant,\" are not related to the context of the question and are therefore incorrect."}

This is because instruments are commonly made using metal, especially those that require durability and strength, such as brass and percussion instruments. The other options do not have as strong of a connection to the use of metal, as a junkyard may contain metal but does not require its use, ore is a raw material, a metal fabrication shop is a place where metal is worked on, and bowls may be made with various materials."}

If you were on the surface of the sun, what would kill you first?"}}, "k": "heat\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that being on the surface of the sun would cause harm to a person. One of the forms of energy that the sun produces is heat which is known to be an extreme form of temperature that can quickly cause harm and even kill people. The other options such as ocean, life on earth, wrinkles, and light do not have any relation to the context of the sentence and are not relevant to the question."}

The most likely scenario where this would occur is in a courtroom, where lawyers argue their cases in front of a judge and jury, and potentially a gallery of spectators. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Where would he put them?"}}, "k": "garage\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James bought tire chains for his vehicle and put them in a place where he could easily find them when needed. It is logical to assume that the most appropriate place to store tire chains would be in a garage, where the vehicle is usually parked. The other options do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence."}

Out of the choices, only leaves gather light as part of the process of photosynthesis and fit the criteria of being edible and requiring washing. The other options, such as roots and millions of cells, do not necessarily need to be washed and are not commonly eaten as food."}

But he found his old one near his car.  Where did he find the old one?"}}, "k": "garage\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John already had an old water hose that he thought was lost or missing. The most likely place for him to find it would be in a storage area for outdoor or gardening equipment, such as a garage or a garden shed. The other choices, like a hardware store or greenhouse, do not make sense in the context of the sentence as places where John could find his old water hose."}

Property tax payments are a common expense associated with owning a home, so it makes sense that the homeowner would have to deal with this task later. The other options do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as city, town, or New York City, do not fit the context of the sentence as they are more indicative of urban or suburban environments. The phrase \"meandered through\" also implies that the thoroughfare is taking a more winding route, which is more characteristic of a rural setting than an urban one."}

The most logical choice from the options provided is therefore a furniture store, as that is where one would typically go to purchase furniture.

The fear of blowfish is also more likely to be relevant in a jungle environment, as blowfish are known to inhabit freshwater rivers and streams, while piranhas are actually more commonly found in the Amazon River basin. The other options, such as Cuba or the Atlantic Ocean, do not fit with the context of the sentence."}

The word \"effort\" is commonly associated with hard work, which makes it the most suitable option. \"Thinking\" and \"medium\" do not accurately reflect the idea of difficulty in communication. \"Laugh\" suggests a positive tone, which is not consistent with the situation described. \"Force\" implies aggression, which is not mentioned in the sentence."}

In maritime law and practice, if a captain dies at sea, someone needs to take charge of the ship and navigate it to safety. Therefore, the correct answer would be \"man crew\" since the remaining crew members would need to take over the responsibilities and tasks of the captain.

The options \"syllable,\" \"English alphabet,\" \"email,\" and \"invitation\" do not have a clear connection to this context. \"Word\" makes the most sense as a possible instruction for the field general to send when the enemy was near, as it could be a signal to take action or convey important information quickly."}

In such labs, it is important to have fire safety measures in place, including fire extinguishers, since chemicals can be highly flammable and potentially dangerous. The other answer choices might have fire extinguishers as well, but they are not necessarily specific to dealing with combustible mixtures, which is the main focus of the sentence."}

The options \"spread disease,\" \"swamp,\" and \"fly away,\" do not fit this description as they either describe negative or unrelated concepts. \"Cat condo\" also does not fit as it is intended for a different type of animal. \"Bug campers\" is the most likely answer as it suggests a place for bugs to stay and also implies that the bugs will be mobile, or able to travel, which fits with the idea of annoying critters that need to be kept away."}

The other options are not likely to have a significant amount of sports equipment for sale. Malls typically have a variety of stores, but sports equipment is not their main focus. Office supply stores are for office supplies and equipment, and schools are educational institutions that do not typically sell sports equipment. A sporting event is a temporary event and not a type of store."}

The logical place to buy a high-end wristwatch would be a jewelry store, as they typically carry luxury watches. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence."}

Rushing would be the most appropriate way for the child to get to the place where they can play as quickly as possible. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, such as slowly or being entertained, which suggest a lack of urgency or a focus on something other than playing."}

The first step is that it will show you how to declare what?"}}, "k": "debt\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the buying products are related to financial assistance for those who have no money. The implication is that the product will show the user how to manage their financial situation, starting with declaring their debt. The other options are not related to financial assistance or managing one's money, and are therefore not appropriate answers."}

The word \"ridiculous\" fits this context and suggests that the person is acting foolishly. The other options do not match the tone of the sentence or the implied comparison between the person's behavior and that of a clown."}

The term \"Gulf States\" refers to the states that are located along the Gulf of Mexico, including Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Therefore, \"Gulf States\" is the most appropriate choice to answer the question. The other options are either too specific (98 of world's crayfish) or too general (United States, Bible Belt) and do not provide a clear answer to the question."}

Brownstones are a type of row house commonly found in certain cities, such as New York and Boston, which have a distinct stoop leading up to the front door. Hotels, condominiums, entering buildings, and office buildings may have entrances with steps, but they are not typically referred to as a stoop, making brownstone the correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "63963c9c15835d451aac2e1e0b116388", "question": {"question_concept": "wood", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "gilded"}, {"label": "B", "text": "porous"}, {"label": "C", "text": "solid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "painted"}, {"label": "E", "text": "less dense than water"}], "stem": "If the wood texture is not smooth it is what?"}}, "k": "porous\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a texture issue with the wood. The word \"smooth\" implies that the surface of the wood should be free of any roughness or irregularities. Of the given options, only \"porous\" refers to a texture that is not smooth. Porous wood has small holes or pores on the surface, which make it less smooth to the touch. The other options do not describe a lack of smoothness in texture, or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "cc8324b73ed9625e723ef041dfc77a37", "question": {"question_concept": "losing weight", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "loose skin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "beauty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "miss universe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "death"}, {"label": "E", "text": "healthier"}], "stem": "What might happen if someone is not losing weight?"}}, "k": "loose skin\nKnowledge: The question is asking about the potential consequence of not losing weight, which suggests that the person may have previously been overweight or obese. When someone loses a significant amount of weight, their skin can become loose and saggy because it has lost the elasticity that was previously stretched out. This is a common concern for people who are trying to lose weight, especially if they are losing a large amount of weight quickly. The other options are not logical consequences of not losing weight, with \"miss universe\" and \"healthier\" being positive outcomes rather than negative ones, and \"death\" being an extreme and unlikely consequence in most cases."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "684dbde19719e8224113433981d6e01e", "question": {"question_concept": "capital", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "small town"}, {"label": "B", "text": "jail"}, {"label": "C", "text": "lower case"}, {"label": "D", "text": "contain governmental activities"}, {"label": "E", "text": "lowercase"}], "stem": "Billy lived in the capital of his country, then he moved.  Where might he move to?"}}, "k": "small town\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy originally lived in a large city, which is typically associated with being the capital of a country. If he moved from the city, it would make sense that he would move to a smaller town or city, rather than jail or a place associated with governmental activities. \"Lowercase\" is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The word \"major\" indicates that this is likely related to a course of study in higher education, and the use of the word \"class\" is commonly associated with college courses. The other options, such as color or encyclopedia, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Jogging is a form of exercise that is known to improve cardiovascular health, burn calories, and strengthen muscles, which makes it a good choice for someone who wants to get in shape. Eating more or giving up on exercise altogether would not have a positive effect on someone's fitness goals, and starving oneself is never a healthy or sustainable approach. A period of recovery may be necessary after a workout, but it is not something that \"does wonders\" for getting in shape."}

The choice of \"low fuel tank\" makes sense because it could cause the car to come to a complete stop and be unable to continue driving. The other options may affect the driver's ability to continue driving (such as backache or smoke), but would not physically prevent the car from moving forward. Automobile accidents, while a potential cause for a car to stop moving, are not a preventative factor that could stop a car from continuing to drive, and pollution is not directly related to the function of a car."}

The options \"supermarket,\" \"juice,\" \"hostel,\" and \"cabinet\" do not make sense as places to store large containers. A factory, however, is a place where large items are often stored, as it is a space dedicated to industrial production and manufacturing."}

Given the negative connotation of the word \"mean,\" it is likely that the person will feel relieved to be free from the negativity and mistreatment associated with the previous relationship. The other options are less likely because they do not correspond well with the context of the sentence. For example, \"isolation\" doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that the person is no longer married to someone mean, and \"angry\" is not a typical response to an end of a bad relationship."}

The choices \"small group,\" \"solitary,\" and \"solitude\" all suggest a lack of other people around, which contradicts the initial sentence. \"Panic\" suggests a strong reaction to the crowds, but the sentence suggests that the man's mood is more subdued. \"Alone\" is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a feeling of isolation and detachment even when surrounded by others."}

Motels typically have housekeeping staff who clean the rooms and empty trash cans. The other options (bus stop, corner, hockey game, and alley) do not have any clear connection to this context."}

Of the given choices, \"walked\" is the most physically demanding option for a dog, while the other choices do not necessarily require a lot of physical energy. \"Petted\" and \"affection\" are emotions that do not cause physical exhaustion, while \"go outside\" and \"scratch\" do not necessarily involve physical activity."}

The most likely location for this scenario is a beach, where people often use umbrellas or other types of shade to protect themselves from the sun while enjoying the sand and water. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence as well - waves, seattle, suitcase, and jacket closet don't have any clear connection to the use of an umbrella while tanning."}

Rainforests are known for being home to many colorful and exotic bird species, so it's likely that the feathers of the birds found in the rainforest are also very colorful. The other options do not provide any relevant information or connection to the context of the sentence."}

The word \"Norse\" indicates that the group is likely from Scandinavia, and \"viking ship\" is the most logical choice for a transportation method for this group. The other options are unrelated and do not make sense in the given context."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This helps to prevent strain or injury to their voice and ensures that they are able to perform at their best. Using microphones and clearing throats are common practices as well, but they are usually part of the actual performance rather than preparation. Creating music and sounding beautiful are general characteristics of being a singer, but they do not specifically relate to what singers need to do before a show."}

{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "14309d9bd3c13d1c0efb625198f6304a", "question": {"question_concept": "performing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "action"}, {"label": "B", "text": "butterflies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "happiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a sense of calm"}, {"label": "E", "text": "anxiety"}], "stem": "What type of feeling is performing for the first time likely to produce?"}}, "k": "anxiety\nKnowledge: The phrase \"performing for the first time\" suggests that the person in question is likely inexperienced or nervous. It is common for people to feel anxious or nervous before a new experience or performance, especially if they are not used to being in the spotlight or performing in front of others. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the typical emotional response to performing for the first time."}

The other options (misery, distress, tickle) do not align with the severity of the crime being discussed. The last option (go to jail) is a consequence of committing murder, not an action that was taken towards someone else."}

Processing information is a general function of a computer, but it is not specific to being connected to the internet. Believing in God and making decisions are not related to the technical capabilities of a computer."}

The word \"unsuitable\" suggests that there is a characteristic of the planet that makes it challenging for humans to live there. Mercury is too close to the sun, so it has extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation levels that are harmful to humans, making it uninhabitable. The other choices, such as \"toxic,\" \"poisonous,\" and \"mercury sulphide,\" do not suitably answer the question and may mislead the individuals. \"Jupiter\" is a gas giant and cannot support human life."}

This feeling is common among performers or public speakers who may experience stage fright or performance anxiety. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "60e7338e9e6bfc746a15a161eb12706c", "question": {"question_concept": "creek", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "meadow"}, {"label": "B", "text": "stick"}, {"label": "C", "text": "valley"}, {"label": "D", "text": "forest"}, {"label": "E", "text": "countryside"}], "stem": "A creek could be located in the opposite for the city which is called what?"}}, "k": "countryside\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the creek is opposite to the city, which implies that it is in a rural or natural environment away from urban development. Out of the given choices, countryside is the only option that fits this description. A meadow is generally a flat, open area of land with grass and flowers, stick does not make logical sense in this context, a valley is a low point between the mountains or hills, and a forest refers to a large area of trees or woods. None of these options specifically suggest a location opposite to the city."}

They are known for their colorful tentacles and resemble flowers, which may explain why they are called anemones. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to find anemones."}

A bedroom or closet may be where the suitcase is kept, but the traveling clothes themselves are not typically stored in these locations. Draws and dressers are both types of furniture that can be used for clothing storage, but they are not commonly used for traveling clothes specifically."}

The most likely location for this would be a convenience store, as they often have public restrooms and require a purchase to receive a key or access code. The other options, such as schools and theaters, typically have free restrooms or do not require a purchase to access them. Rest areas and malls may have restrooms that require a key or code, but it is less common for them to require a purchase."}

The word \"fall\" suggests that the pessimist is warning everyone about a negative event that the sun will cause, like a drop in temperature or the onset of bad weather. Therefore, \"fall\" is the most logical answer."}

A bookcase is the most likely option for this because it is a piece of furniture specifically designed to hold books, which often come in varying sizes. The other options, such as a grocery store or a chest of drawers, do not make sense in this context."}

Therefore, if you are watching a comedy film, you would expect to hear laughter from the audience. The other options do not make sense in this context. For instance, parks are typically associated with outdoor recreational activities, insight refers to gaining knowledge, being entertained could involve various forms of engagement, and fear is associated with horror or suspense genres."}

Cape Canaveral Florida and NASA are related to space launches and not to the context of the sentence. Battleships and oceans are also not related to the sentence."}

The only option that relates to this context is defecating, which refers to the process of expelling waste from the body. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not fit the context as they refer to the characteristics of the pizza rather than the location where it is obtained."}

Therefore, if someone is looking for a place to stay, they would use the phone book to search for hotels or motels in the area. The other options (Mexico, town, city, sun dial) do not provide any assistance in finding lodging accommodations."}

Connecting to a computer network is a common way to do this, which is why it's the correct answer. The other options do not relate to connecting a laptop to the internet or other devices."}

The most likely option is love, as it is a common expression of affection and support towards family members. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

The phrase \"go to movies\" is the only option that directly refers to this action, while the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. \"Open eyes\" is too general and could apply to any activity, while \"kick ball\" and \"make art\" have no relevance to watching new films. \"Look for\" is also too vague and does not provide enough information about what specifically a person should be looking for."}

The context suggests that this outcome is positive or at least productive. Daydreaming and becoming distracted are both possibilities that might come with contemplation, but they are not the most likely outcome in this context. A headache and sleep are not outcomes that are commonly associated with contemplation, and they do not make sense in this sentence. Getting ideas, on the other hand, is a common outcome of contemplation, especially if the contemplation is focused and deliberate."}

Checkers and buffalo are not related to storage, while baking soda is not typically stored in barrels. Salt can sometimes be stored in barrels, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Barrels, on the other hand, are commonly used for storage purposes, especially in pioneer times when they were used to store food, drink, and other supplies. Therefore, the correct answer is barrels."}

Unfortunately, this one had endured some abuse and had become what?"}}, "k": "bent\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John needed a straight wire, but the wire has become something else due to damage or use. The words \"abuse\" and \"endured\" suggest that the wire has undergone some sort of force or stress that has caused it to no longer be straight. The words \"crooked\" and \"curved\" both suggest that the wire is not straight, but \"bent\" is the most appropriate choice as it directly implies the wire was once straight but is now bowed due to external factors. The other options do not match the description in the sentence."}

The term \"ore\" refers to mineral deposits that contain valuable metals, such as iron, gold, and silver. Extracting metal from ore is a process that involves crushing and smelting the ore, which separates the metal from the other elements in the ore. The other options do not accurately describe the source of metal or the process by which it is obtained."}

It also uses the word \"property\", which implies that it is not being used outside in a specific location. Out of the choices provided, the most likely place to store a household item like a bucket would be in a utility closet. The other options are either outdoor locations or specific structures that may not be available for all households."}

Therefore, the most likely answer is that the stapler could be in a desk drawer, which is a common place to store office supplies."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "5bba03b425f5abc6e017f194cf074b06", "question": {"question_concept": "courtyard", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "candidate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "spain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "lawn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "asshole"}, {"label": "E", "text": "office complex"}], "stem": "Many homes in this country are built around a courtyard. Where is it?"}}, "k": "Spain\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that many homes in a particular country are built around a courtyard, suggesting that this is a common architectural feature in that country. The option \"Spain\" stands out as a possible answer, as traditional Spanish homes are often built around a central courtyard known as a \"patio.\" The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some are even inappropriate or offensive."}

He  loved to build houses, but in his current state, he couldn't do what?"}}, "k": "construct\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean is in a state where he is unable to do something related to his love of building houses. \"Construct\" is the most specific term related to building houses, as it refers directly to the act of creating something. The other options are more general or vague and do not necessarily relate to building houses specifically."}

Fighting, misunderstanding, play, and distrust are not directly connected to the act of pretending to be a police officer."}

Fine crafted writing instruments are usually sold in specialized stores that cater to professional writers, artists, calligraphers, etc. This type of store is known as a stationery store. The other choices in the answer list have no clear connection to the context of the question."}

The most likely reason for a detective to gather information from witnesses is to help solve a crime or piece together an investigation. The other options, such as fun, happiness, and power, do not make sense in the context of investigating a crime and obtaining information from witnesses. The option \"ulcers\" is not a valid reason for the detective's actions."}

Where might that be?"}}, "k": "toolbox\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe keeps his tools in a place where spiders have been found. The most likely option for this is a toolbox, as it is a common storage solution for tools and can easily attract spiders if left untouched for a long period of time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "9fdebd1c2cf498f1d726a025b780a39a", "question": {"question_concept": "bald eagle", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "everglades"}, {"label": "B", "text": "high places"}, {"label": "C", "text": "natural habitat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "new york"}, {"label": "E", "text": "colorado"}], "stem": "While on the fan boat he thought he'd see swamps and gators, but he was surprised to spot a bald eagle in what nature area?"}}, "k": "everglades\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person was on a fan boat in a nature area known for swamps and alligators. A bald eagle sighting is unexpected in this scenario and suggests that the person may have been in a location where bald eagles are known to live. The Everglades in Florida is a well-known nature area that is home to both alligators and bald eagles, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "f36027954e43cfd926451bdf7cb0c3ac", "question": {"question_concept": "supermarket", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "buy food for family"}, {"label": "B", "text": "city or town"}, {"label": "C", "text": "get supplies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "strip mall"}, {"label": "E", "text": "vermont"}], "stem": "Where are you likely to find a supermarket?"}}, "k": "city or town\nKnowledge: Supermarkets are typically found in areas with a higher population density, such as cities and towns, where there is a greater demand for groceries and supplies. Strip malls may also contain supermarkets, but they are usually located in commercial areas rather than residential ones. Vermont is also not a likely answer, as it is a specific location and not a general category of where one might find a supermarket. The phrase \"buy food for family\" and \"get supplies\" may suggest a need for a supermarket, but they are not specific enough to be the correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "7ec14907622c6d5a6087cd59a22d8c9d", "question": {"question_concept": "lantern", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "grocery store"}, {"label": "B", "text": "antique shop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "dark place"}, {"label": "E", "text": "street"}], "stem": "Where would you need to use a lantern?"}}, "k": "dark place\nKnowledge: A lantern is a portable source of light that is typically used in situations where there is no access to electricity or other sources of light. The options \"grocery store,\" \"antique shop,\" and \"house\" all have access to electricity, and therefore would not require a lantern. \"Street\" might require a lantern in certain situations, but the most specific and accurate answer is \"dark place,\" as this covers a broad range of scenarios where a lantern would be necessary, such as camping, hiking, or exploring caves."}

This term is commonly used in police jargon and is often heard in police dramas and movies. The other options, such as \"direct traffic\" or \"park,\" do not necessarily pertain to the specific area that a police officer is responsible for."}

The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence or provide an unlikely explanation for the baby's crankiness (crying or refusing to get out of bed). The option \"buy food\" is also unlikely as it is unlikely that a baby would be responsible for purchasing its own food."}

The options \"buildings,\" \"apartment,\" and \"falling down\" are not made up of people, but physical structures or events. While a classroom contains people, it can also refer to an empty room, and the context of the sentence does not specify that it is referring to a room filled with people. \"Audience\" fits the criteria of being made up of people, as it is a group of individuals gathered together to watch a performance or event."}

In such a situation, seeking help from a medical professional would be the most logical course of action, as they would be able to provide the necessary treatment and care to help the person recover. The other options (ocean, write will, never want, were shot) do not make sense in the given context."}

A desk drawer is a common place to store pens and other office supplies, making it a likely choice for finding a pen. The other options do not provide a clear solution to the problem of not having a pen."}

The word \"because\" is often used to explain why something was done, so it is likely that the little boy's response was \"because.\" The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "6f48ee564a48293eb501cc0d8197bdd9", "question": {"question_concept": "picture", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "microwave"}, {"label": "B", "text": "desktop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "shelf"}, {"label": "D", "text": "art show"}, {"label": "E", "text": "wall"}], "stem": "Where would you display a picture on a horizontal surface?"}}, "k": "desktop\nKnowledge: A horizontal surface typically refers to a flat surface that is parallel to the ground, such as a table or desk. It is common to display pictures on a flat surface in a room, such as a desktop or a shelf, especially if the picture is small or if wall space is limited. A picture displayed on a wall would be in a vertical orientation, so this option can be eliminated. A microwave is not a suitable surface for displaying pictures and an art show is an event where pictures are displayed, not a surface to display them."}

While wheels and pedalling are necessary components of a bike, they don't necessarily require a specific skill. Feet are used for pedalling, but balance is more important for riding a bike. Practice is important for improving one's bike riding skills, but it is not a skill in and of itself."}

The use of the word \"ground\" in the choices suggests that this is where the oil is being extracted from, which is consistent with common oil drilling practices. The other options, such as \"manual\" and \"restaurant,\" have no obvious relevance to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "b7ab4a5e0c19a98f41cd1ba3176f2dff", "question": {"question_concept": "deliver", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "delivered"}, {"label": "B", "text": "take away"}, {"label": "C", "text": "receiving"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pick up"}, {"label": "E", "text": "keep"}], "stem": "The department to where vendors deliver goods for sale is called what?"}}, "k": "receiving\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a place where vendors bring goods for sale. The term \"receiving\" is commonly used in retail and other industries to refer to the department or area where incoming goods are processed and stored. The other options do not relate to this context, as they either refer to taking away goods (take away) or keeping them (keep), which is not what a department for receiving goods would do. \"Delivered\" and \"pick up\" are also not correct as they do not describe the department or area where goods are received."}

This implies that waiting in a line for a long time is seen as undesirable in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Stretching is a common post-workout activity that helps to reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility, making it a logical choice for the correct answer. The other options, such as lowering cholesterol or tracking progress, do not specifically relate to post-workout recovery."}

In such a situation, the most logical choice would be to go back home and retrieve the forgotten item. The other options do not provide any solution to the problem of forgetting something at home."}

Band practice, concert, symphony, and music room are not likely places to purchase a wind instrument for personal use as they are primarily associated with group performances or practice spaces."}

It is not a typical activity in a supermarket, bar, pub, or restaurant, which are commercial establishments that primarily serve food and drinks to customers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be a place where scientific experiments are conducted, such as a chemistry lab."}

This type of view is typically seen from a high vantage point, such as the top floor of a tall building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "81cc0d320488c7bacafb285cf7db5fbd", "question": {"question_concept": "lettuce", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "kitchen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "supermarket"}, {"label": "C", "text": "farmer's market"}, {"label": "D", "text": "salad"}, {"label": "E", "text": "refrigerator"}], "stem": "Where does lettuce arrive by large trucks?"}}, "k": "supermarket\nKnowledge: The question implies that lettuce is being transported in bulk and sold at a particular location. A supermarket is the most likely option as it is a large retailer that sells a wide range of products, including fresh produce that is often transported in large trucks. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not involve the transportation of lettuce or are not a likely location for bulk produce sales."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "26c8a7165d0ed7250b9328f90d83ba83", "question": {"question_concept": "dying", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rejuvenation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "born again"}, {"label": "C", "text": "no longer exist"}, {"label": "D", "text": "unable to work"}, {"label": "E", "text": "change of color"}], "stem": "Why do people who are dying receive social security payments?"}}, "k": "unable to work\nKnowledge: Social security payments are typically given to individuals who have retired and are no longer able to work. The sentence suggests that people who are dying receive these payments, which implies that they are no longer able to work due to their condition. The other options do not make sense in this context - rejuvenation and born again are religious concepts, no longer exist is too final and does not explain why they would receive payments, and change of color has no connection to the topic of social security payments."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "636fc69dee35cd357b4191b47e64d0e5", "question": {"question_concept": "jumping rope", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fatigue"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sweating"}, {"label": "C", "text": "get tired"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tiredness"}, {"label": "E", "text": "hopping"}], "stem": "What should I do with a jumping rope?"}}, "k": "hopping\nKnowledge: A jumping rope is typically used for a type of exercise called jump rope, where the user jumps over the rope as it passes under their feet. The word \"hopping\" is the most closely related to the physical action of jumping during jump rope exercise. The other choices are more closely associated with the physical effects of exercise, such as fatigue, sweating, and tiredness."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "f0c4622a082eb9ad0690dd36dcf61297", "question": {"question_concept": "geese", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "guard house"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "eat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "follow ultralight airplane"}, {"label": "E", "text": "group together"}], "stem": "What do geese do every fall in fields?"}}, "k": "fly\nKnowledge: The sentence references the fall season and fields, which suggests that the geese may be participating in a migration. Geese are known for their annual migrations, where they fly long distances from their breeding grounds to warmer climates in the fall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "4499ebd5e8188b0d5fdef6afd893017a", "question": {"question_concept": "seat", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "airplane"}, {"label": "B", "text": "movie"}, {"label": "C", "text": "auditorium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "theatre"}, {"label": "E", "text": "show"}], "stem": "I took my seat, the curtains drew back and I enjoyed the what?"}}, "k": "theatre\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker entered a space, took their seat, and then the curtains were drawn back to reveal a performance. This is a common experience in a theatre setting where audiences go to watch shows. The options airplane and movie are unlikely because there would not be curtains that draw back in those settings, and the word \"enjoyed\" suggests that the answer likely refers to a form of entertainment. Auditorium is a more general term and while it may be used in the context of a theatre, it is not specific enough to be the correct answer."}

Therefore, the correct answer would be related to achieving peace. \"Explicate\" means to explain or analyze, which does not relate to the idea of peace. \"Pay tribute to king\" is irrelevant to the question. \"Wear shoes\" and \"do well\" are also not related to achieving peace. Therefore, the only logical answer is \"hope for peace.\""}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "6163a897cd7eac1deddd4c002a1930ae", "question": {"question_concept": "post office", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "building"}, {"label": "B", "text": "business district"}, {"label": "C", "text": "above ground"}, {"label": "D", "text": "most towns"}, {"label": "E", "text": "center of town"}], "stem": "Where is the ideal location for a post office?"}}, "k": "center of town\nKnowledge: Post offices are typically found in the center of town or city, making them easily accessible to as many people as possible. Placing a post office in a building or above ground may be possible, but it is not necessarily the ideal location. Most towns may have a post office, but their location can vary. The business district may be a suitable location, but not necessarily the ideal one since not everyone lives or works in that area. Therefore, the best fit from the choices given is the center of town."}

While squirrels may occasionally venture into urban areas, it is unlikely that they would make their home on a roof or inside a home. Parks and yards may provide some habitat for squirrels, but they are not typically large enough to support a sustained population. Forests, on the other hand, offer an abundance of trees and other resources that squirrels need to survive."}

The Amazon River is located in South America, but is known for its large number of snake species, making it the most likely correct answer. The other options, such as tree or western Texas, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Therefore, the correct answer would be \"cook dinner.\" The other answer choices do not make logical sense based on the given information."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "c39131d979c9205c11d0e109e18188e4", "question": {"question_concept": "trees", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "yard"}, {"label": "B", "text": "orchard"}, {"label": "C", "text": "museum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "countryside"}, {"label": "E", "text": "surface of earth"}], "stem": "To what do trees roots cling?"}}, "k": "surface of earth\nKnowledge: The question is asking about where tree roots cling, which is typically to the surface of the earth or soil. The other options (yard, orchard, museum, countryside) do not have any clear relevance to the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "bd773d64f4e22db2358c6e00cbdf2d83", "question": {"question_concept": "dust", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "closet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "door"}, {"label": "C", "text": "corner"}, {"label": "D", "text": "shelf"}, {"label": "E", "text": "library"}], "stem": "What probably has a lot of dust in the back?"}}, "k": "shelf\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being referred to is located in the back and has a lot of dust, which is commonly associated with shelves that are not frequently used or cleaned. Closets, doors, and corners may also accumulate dust, but they do not have the same implied placement as \"in the back.\" A library could also have a lot of dust, but the sentence does not imply that the object is part of a larger collection or space."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "2b416120e2fbd84b44b5dcd4eb42ed5c", "question": {"question_concept": "making friends", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "smiling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "smile"}, {"label": "C", "text": "open mind"}, {"label": "D", "text": "common interests"}, {"label": "E", "text": "laughter"}], "stem": "At the new comic store he found himself making friends, it was nice to meet people with what?"}}, "k": "common interests\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist felt welcomed and happy to be meeting new people at the comic store. The phrase \"making friends\" indicates that these people share some common ground or interests, which is further supported by the use of the phrase \"it was nice to meet people with\". The other options (smiling, smile, open mind, and laughter) do not fully capture the idea of shared interests, and are less likely to be the correct answer."}

The inner ear contains the vestibular system, which is responsible for maintaining balance and spatial orientation. Therefore, the most likely choice is the inner ear. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Singing, state parks, carnival, and opera do not necessarily involve talking, although singing and opera may involve vocalization."}

Asking questions can help students think critically and reflect on what they have learned, which is the main goal of teaching. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of an adult asking a child questions."}

If someone with lactose intolerance eats a dinner made of cheese (which contains lactose), they are likely to experience indigestion, which can cause symptoms such as bloating, gas, nausea, and abdominal pain. The other options are less likely to occur in this context."}

It implies that this activity took place in a room specifically designated for music education, which is commonly referred to as a music room. The bathroom, house, living room, and music store are unlikely locations for such an activity to take place, making them incorrect answers."}

The other options are not related to the context of the question."}

While wetness and the use of water are necessary components of taking a bath, they are not the main purpose. Exfoliation, while sometimes a secondary benefit of using specific bath products, is not a necessary component of bathing."}

What kind of game were they playing?"}}, "k": "sporting event\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that it was a game where a ball was hit over a boundary, which is a common feature in sports such as cricket or baseball. The term \"sporting event\" also implies a sense of organized competition or spectatorship, which further supports the idea that it was a game or match rather than another type of activity like \"society\" or \"ranch country\". \"Basketball\" is unlikely to be the correct answer since hitting a ball over a boundary is not a feature of basketball."}

In this case, the term \"inebriated\" suggests that the person is under the influence of alcohol, which in turn means that they are likely to be accused of \"drunk driving.\" The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The choices \"job,\" \"boredom,\" \"anxiety,\" and \"impatience\" do not make sense in this context. \"Wisdom\" is a commonly associated goal of philosophical study, which would align with the idea that a philosopher is seeking to gain knowledge and understanding through their studies."}

Skiing and playing hockey are both common winter sports that are often done on ice, while knitting and warming oneself have no clear connection to the context. \"Summer\" is also not a viable option as the question specifies the winter season. Therefore, the most likely answer is \"play hockey.\""}

The word \"clutter\" is often used to describe a space that is filled with too many objects and lacks organization, which makes it the most fitting choice. \"Poverty\" is unlikely to be the correct answer because the sentence does not suggest that the woman's spending habits are causing financial difficulties for her. \"Getting\" and \"more happiness\" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and \"satisfaction\" is not the most precise word to describe the result of having a lot of objects on every shelf."}

Talking to their granddaughter is a positive experience that would likely cause happiness. The option \"ocean\" does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option \"headache\" suggests a negative effect, but there is no indication in the sentence that the person is experiencing any physical discomfort. The option \"program created\" is irrelevant to the sentence. However, the use of technology can often lead to stress, particularly for older adults who may not be as comfortable using computers."}

Convention centers are designed to hold large events, such as conferences, conventions, and trade shows. Public buildings, person and large buildings are too broad and do not provide any additional information to suggest that Joe is specifically in a convention center. A box is not likely to be a suitable location for a large gathering of people."}

He had to delay before of where he lived.  Where did he live?"}}, "k": "pay debts\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that John could not scatter his wife's remains in the wilderness because he needed to delay due to paying debts. This suggests that John may have been struggling financially and was unable to travel to the location where he wanted to scatter his wife's remains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Out of the given options, only parks are typically located alongside sidewalks and have a high volume of visitors, making them a suitable location for trash cans. Hospitals, motels, and offices are typically located on larger properties and do not have as much foot traffic on sidewalks, while corners may have some foot traffic but are not a common location for trash cans."}

Molars are the teeth located towards the back of the mouth, which are used for grinding and chewing food. They have more surface area and deeper grooves, which makes them more prone to developing cavities. The other options in the choices do not relate specifically to teeth or dental health, except for the dentist option, which is more related to preventative care rather than the location of a potential cavity."}

The options \"nursery,\" \"desert,\" and \"south pacific\" do not have any clear connection to sea life, so they can be eliminated. The remaining options are \"sea water\" and \"Atlantic Ocean.\" While an anemone could potentially live in the Atlantic Ocean, the more general answer of \"sea water\" is a better fit since anemones can be found in various bodies of saltwater across the world."}

The options ‘yurt’, ‘resort area’, and ‘going on vacation’ do not fit the criteria of being a specific place that the person needs to be in. ‘Michigan’ is a geographic location and not a specific destination, so it also does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, ‘big city’ is the best answer as cities are typically associated with specific places and activities, making it the most likely option for the person to want to be close to where they need to be."}

Seeing art is a common suggestion for people looking for beauty, as art can be visually stunning and emotionally evocative. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to beauty or may not be feasible options for someone looking for a quick distraction from boredom (e.g. grocery shopping or doing a crossword puzzle). Additionally, seeing a ghost may not be considered beautiful by everyone."}

This is a basic principle of physics, as an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. The other options, such as the ocean or a flintlock, have no clear connection to the sentence and do not make sense in this context."}

A table is a common surface for placing drinks while relaxing, and it is also mentioned in contrast to the other options (coffee shop, kitchen, hand, office), which would not necessarily have a table or suitable surfaces to place a cup of coffee."}

This would result in a messy plate that would need to be cleaned after the meal. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not relate to eggs or food waste."}

If someone is behaving with proper aplomb, they are likely exhibiting good manners and social grace. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a behavior that goes against these socially acceptable norms, such as being impolite. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to manners or social behavior."}

It also implies that the squash court is located within a facility that the person has access to. The term \"country club\" is commonly associated with private recreational facilities that offer amenities such as squash courts, swimming pools, fitness centers, and other recreational activities. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence, except for \"fitness center,\" which may also have squash courts."}

Digestion is the process of breaking down food into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body. The other options do not relate to the process of eating and digesting food."}

The other options do not make sense in this context - a corner, street, closet, or bathtub are not typically used for gardening."}

From this, we can infer that the person being judged may feel negatively about the experience. The word \"resentment\" suggests a feeling of bitterness or indignation towards the one doing the judging, which would be a common reaction to being judged guilty. The other options do not accurately capture the emotions that one might feel in this situation."}

A hospital or train station may also be located in a valley, but the sentence specifically mentions two mountains, which indicates a geological feature rather than a man-made structure. The mention of Michigan or any other state seems irrelevant to the context of the sentence."}

Eventually he broke down and did something very expensive so that he could get a toilet.  Where might he have gone?"}}, "k": "motel room\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James had to pay a high price for using a toilet, which is unlikely to be the case for a typical public bathroom or one in a regular residence. Motel rooms are often associated with a paid option for a private bathroom, making it the most likely choice for James. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Because heavy metal music typically requires high volume and a lot of energy, it is likely that they needed electricity to power their instruments and amplifiers in order to provide a good performance for the audience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

They often require the solver to use their problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities to arrive at a solution. Avoiding pain, seeking compliments, or obtaining a passing grade are not motivations commonly associated with completing puzzles or riddles. Attention-seeking may be a motivation for some individuals, but it is not a definitive answer given the context of the question."}

The option \"feeling satisfied\" is a plausible choice, but the most direct and literal answer is \"house clean.\""}

Hospitals are a place where people often pass away and where bodies are kept before being moved to other locations. It is common practice for hospitals to cover bodies with a sheet or blanket out of respect for the deceased, which is why this option is the most likely answer. The other choices have no clear relevance to the context provided."}

The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what?"}}, "k": "accelerate\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in the car was trying to kill the man, and they were in pursuit. The fact that the man was trying to break the glass in order to escape also implies that the car was closing in on him quickly. Therefore, the correct answer is \"accelerate,\" as this option best reflects the action the person in the car would have taken to try and catch the man. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Additionally, a garden or state park may be pleasant locations for relaxation, but a rest area is the most common place for a trucker to take a break on a long drive."}

Therefore, \"state\" is the correct answer. \"Democratic\" is a political term that can describe both republics and other forms of government, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. \"Kingdom,\" \"democracy,\" and \"dictatorship\" are all forms of government that are different from a republic, making them incorrect choices."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "7a58e7e7bf76658751e850f790922aba", "question": {"question_concept": "clothing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "person"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hamper"}, {"label": "C", "text": "closet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "upstairs"}, {"label": "E", "text": "backpack"}], "stem": "Where do you keep extra clothing on a hike?"}}, "k": "backpack\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the person is hiking, which means they are likely traveling on foot and need to carry their belongings with them. The other options (person, hamper, closet, upstairs) suggest stationary locations that are not practical for carrying extra clothing on a hike. A backpack is a common item used for carrying supplies on a hike, making it the logical choice for storing extra clothing."}

The word \"bloom\" specifically refers to the process of the tree producing flowers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options, such as fish market, shallow waters, fresh water, and shore line do not fit this description of a cold area in the east where a crab could be found."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "359aed918343d228e67cef329b693904", "question": {"question_concept": "chef", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "thin potatos"}, {"label": "B", "text": "prepare food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "study french cooking"}, {"label": "D", "text": "drink"}, {"label": "E", "text": "cook dinner"}], "stem": "The chef wanted to perfect his craft, what did he do?"}}, "k": "study french cooking\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the chef is looking to improve his skills, and studying French cooking is often considered one of the best ways to do so. French cuisine is known for its complexity and attention to detail, which requires a lot of training and practice to master. The other options, such as thin potatoes or drinking, do not seem directly related to perfecting the craft of cooking."}

The phrase \"one choice for pet\" matches the meaning conveyed by the sentence, while the other options do not relate to the context or offer an explanation as to why only a puppy was chosen."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "ac1abecdbbd7bcde6592ca645c2ecb1e", "question": {"question_concept": "shade", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "full sunlight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bright sunshine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sunny place"}, {"label": "D", "text": "eat cake"}, {"label": "E", "text": "direct sunlight"}], "stem": "There was no shade for Jenny.  She was forced to lie there exposed to what?"}}, "k": "direct sunlight\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jenny did not have any protection from the sun, which likely means she was exposed to direct sunlight. Options like \"full sunlight,\" \"bright sunshine,\" and \"sunny place\" can all be used to describe sunny environments, but they do not convey the lack of shade that is being described in this sentence. \"Eat cake\" is a completely unrelated option."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "2adbb4fc0d5249dc411dda433f378591", "question": {"question_concept": "cleaning house", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "neatness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "tiredness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "order"}, {"label": "D", "text": "exhaustion"}, {"label": "E", "text": "sneezing"}], "stem": "What could happen to you after you are cleaning house for a long time?"}}, "k": "exhaustion\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that cleaning the house for a long time can lead to a negative physical state. The word \"after\" implies that something may happen as a result of the activity. The options \"neatness,\" \"order,\" and \"sneezing\" do not make sense in this context as they are not negative outcomes of cleaning. \"Tiredness\" is a possibility, but \"exhaustion\" implies a more extreme level of fatigue and is a better answer option."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "5a1c8a9dbbb60e523cc1ba14a370729c", "question": {"question_concept": "going to party", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rumpspringa"}, {"label": "B", "text": "meeting new people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "having fun"}, {"label": "D", "text": "meet new people"}, {"label": "E", "text": "plan"}], "stem": "What is someone doing when scheduling when to go to party?"}}, "k": "plan\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is organizing when to go to a party, which is an act of planning. The other options do not relate to the idea of organizing or scheduling an event. \"Rumpspringa\" refers to a period of adolescence in some Amish communities, \"meeting new people\" and \"having fun\" are not specific enough to describe the action of scheduling, and \"meet new people\" is not a grammatically correct phrase on its own."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "3665b329f93f7c84edeabe394140f8d2", "question": {"question_concept": "comets", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "ice"}, {"label": "B", "text": "set orbits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "universe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "space"}, {"label": "E", "text": "solid nucleus"}], "stem": "What kind of path do comets tend to have?"}}, "k": "set orbits\nKnowledge: Comets are celestial objects that orbit around the sun. Unlike planets, which have relatively circular orbits, comets tend to have highly elliptical orbits. These orbits are often described as \"set orbits\" because they are determined by the gravitational forces of the sun and other objects in the solar system. Comets are composed of an icy nucleus and a trail of gas and dust, which is why \"ice\" is also a plausible answer. However, the question specifically asks about the path of comets, not their composition. \"Universe\" and \"space\" are both too vague to be correct answers, and \"solid nucleus\" is incorrect because it only describes one part of a comet, not its path."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "dbcedaa6a6f1f68bc8f2bf7aef23294e", "question": {"question_concept": "sex", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "bedroom"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pleasant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "obesity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "painful"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dirty"}], "stem": "What do people feel after having sex that requires them to shower?"}}, "k": "dirty\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that after having sex, people may feel dirty and need to shower. This is a common experience as sex involves physical touching and sweating, which can leave one feeling unclean. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "ba3a2b9ff289c106051163f840a6f5ba", "question": {"question_concept": "animals", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "euthanasia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pass water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "die of cancer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "feel pain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "feel pleasure"}], "stem": "The vet found malignant tumors on the animals, what is their likely fate?"}}, "k": "Die of cancer\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the tumors found by the vet were malignant, which means they are cancerous. Cancer is a serious disease that can spread to other parts of the body, causing pain and discomfort for the affected animal. As a result, the likely fate of the animals in question is that they will unfortunately succumb to the cancer and die. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the seriousness of the situation."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "13fc28f53423a9b3a656c9431df1b3b5", "question": {"question_concept": "kissing", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "sexual stimulation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "herpes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "headache"}, {"label": "D", "text": "catch cold"}, {"label": "E", "text": "happiness"}], "stem": "What is the thing that is agitated in your head when kissing?"}}, "k": "sexual stimulation\nKnowledge: Kissing is commonly associated with romantic and sexual intimacy. The option \"sexual stimulation\" is the most logical answer since it refers to the physical arousal and excitement that can result from kissing. The other options, such as herpes, headache, and catching a cold, are negative associations that are not directly related to the act of kissing. \"Happiness\" could also be a possible answer, but it is less specific to the physical sensation described in the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "3f4b48708d08f8bf7bec796531023f9c", "question": {"question_concept": "newspaper", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "trash"}, {"label": "B", "text": "floor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "subway"}, {"label": "D", "text": "ground"}, {"label": "E", "text": "lawn"}], "stem": "Billy was reading the newspaper as he commuted to work, but once he got to his destination he balled it up and put it somewhere. Where did it put it?"}}, "k": "trash\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy got rid of the newspaper once he arrived at his destination. The most common place to dispose of a newspaper is in the trash, making \"trash\" the most likely answer. \"Floor,\" \"subway,\" \"ground,\" and \"lawn\" are all unlikely options as they suggest that Billy left the newspaper in a public place rather than disposing of it properly."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "c61790eb63ff6652b878ca051493c07d", "question": {"question_concept": "pail", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "garage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pool"}, {"label": "C", "text": "utility room"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hardware store"}, {"label": "E", "text": "wishing well"}], "stem": "Where do you keep a pail in your house?"}}, "k": "utility room\nKnowledge: A pail is a type of container usually used for carrying water or other liquids. It is often kept in a utility room, which is a space in a house where all the necessary household items are stored, such as cleaning supplies, tools, and other equipment. The other options are not typically associated with storing household items like pails."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "e5ebbe0ea4097bb197ac525b49108362", "question": {"question_concept": "ink", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fountain pen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "squid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "newspaper"}, {"label": "D", "text": "book"}, {"label": "E", "text": "printer"}], "stem": "what is printed with ink and distributed daily?"}}, "k": "newspaper\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the item is printed with ink and distributed daily. Fountain pens and printers are tools used for printing or writing, but they do not necessarily produce something that is distributed daily. Squid is a sea animal that has nothing to do with printing. Books may be printed with ink, but they are not necessarily distributed daily, whereas newspapers are. Therefore, the correct answer is newspaper."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "029e36d8f65982b142c319064dc5e32f", "question": {"question_concept": "people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "kill each other"}, {"label": "B", "text": "thank god"}, {"label": "C", "text": "experience pain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hatred"}, {"label": "E", "text": "talk to each other"}], "stem": "What are people likely to do when an unexpected decent outcome occurs?"}}, "k": "thank god\nKnowledge: The phrase \"unexpected decent outcome\" suggests that something positive and unexpected has happened. In many cultures, it is common for people to express gratitude or give thanks when something positive happens. The phrase \"kill each other\" and \"hatred\" have negative connotations and would not be appropriate in response to a positive outcome. \"Experience pain\" is also unlikely to be a common response to an unexpected decent outcome. \"Talk to each other\" is a general response that could be appropriate in a variety of situations, but it doesn't specifically address the idea of a positive outcome."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "3d1a67f87b34303f97549ba83e5521c2", "question": {"question_concept": "terrace", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "japan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rice paddy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "garden"}, {"label": "D", "text": "michigan"}, {"label": "E", "text": "italy"}], "stem": "The terrace had Kanji written on it, indicating that it was made where?"}}, "k": "Japan\nKnowledge: Kanji is a form of writing that originated in Japan and is still used today. Therefore, the presence of Kanji on the terrace strongly suggests that it was made in Japan. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "e050bce7048da1b3743a54153e91694e", "question": {"question_concept": "cardboard", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "packaging materials"}, {"label": "B", "text": "recycle bin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "box factory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "warehouse"}, {"label": "E", "text": "bowler hats"}], "stem": "The company sent off many purchases, they used recycled cardboard as their what?"}}, "k": "packaging materials \nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the company sends off purchases to customers and that they use recycled cardboard for something related to the purchases. The most logical option based on this context is \"packaging materials,\" as recycled cardboard is often used for packaging products. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "8233ccb60dd0c0ff3b7ca5d73e5681f2", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "have no home"}, {"label": "B", "text": "false information"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hungry"}, {"label": "D", "text": "made fun of"}, {"label": "E", "text": "brain tumor"}], "stem": "Why might a person be known as a liar?"}}, "k": "false information\nKnowledge: The word \"liar\" is often used to describe someone who intentionally provides false information or deceives others. While the other options may be potential reasons for someone to act in a negative manner, they do not necessarily explain why someone would be labeled as a liar specifically. Therefore, \"false information\" is the most relevant choice based on the given question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "eb4b2cd0f2a69686e5a82250c5806b84", "question": {"question_concept": "waiting for", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "timing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "expenditure of time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "getting bored"}, {"label": "D", "text": "anger"}, {"label": "E", "text": "patience"}], "stem": "The child was politely waiting for dessert, he was eventually rewarded for his what?"}}, "k": "patience\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was rewarded for waiting politely for dessert, which implies that the child demonstrated patience. Patience refers to the ability to wait calmly and without complaint, which would be the appropriate behavior in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence; spending time, getting bored, and anger are not positive behaviors that would be rewarded, and timing does not make sense in this context."}

The phrase \"out of pocket\" is often used to describe expenses that are paid with personal funds rather than from a business or organization. The other options do not make sense in the context of helping a pan handler in the streets."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "e216381e9f0ddd1d248ee25fccca2b1f", "question": {"question_concept": "child", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "principal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "birth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "loving couple"}, {"label": "D", "text": "act of sex"}, {"label": "E", "text": "parents"}], "stem": "What do you call the caretakers of a child?"}}, "k": "parents\nKnowledge: The word \"caretakers\" suggests that the answer is someone responsible for taking care of a child. \"Principal\" refers to the head of a school, \"birth\" refers to the process of giving birth, \"loving couple\" could refer to any two people in a romantic relationship, and \"act of sex\" is not a term used to describe those responsible for taking care of a child. \"Parents\" is the only option that specifically refers to those who have responsibility for the care and upbringing of a child."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "b1fba9ad6193c6751ddb3f58f7f39b35", "question": {"question_concept": "niece", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "family reunion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "brother's house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "family picture book"}, {"label": "D", "text": "family tree"}, {"label": "E", "text": "party"}], "stem": "Where would you run in to a niece you only see every one and a while?"}}, "k": "family reunion\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the niece is not seen often, which indicates that the occasion would be a larger family gathering. A family reunion would be the most likely option for such an event, where extended family members come together after long periods of time. The other options, such as a brother's house or party, do not necessarily guarantee the presence of extended family members. Meanwhile, a family picture book and family tree are not physical places where one can run into someone."}

The word \"taxing\" implies that it was physically or mentally demanding. The word \"elaborate\" suggests that the task was complex and required a high level of skill or attention to detail. The answer option \"energy\" best fits the context of the sentence since it describes the resources needed to complete a demanding task. The other answer options do not relate directly to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "f1182e3a070f5a1be529843aa6e5c20c", "question": {"question_concept": "awaking", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "get up"}, {"label": "B", "text": "discomfort"}, {"label": "C", "text": "discomfort"}, {"label": "D", "text": "headache"}, {"label": "E", "text": "shock"}], "stem": "What may you have after awaking after a night of heavy drinking?"}}, "k": "headache\nKnowledge: This question is related to the common symptoms associated with a hangover after drinking heavily. Headaches are a common symptom, often caused by dehydration or changes in blood flow to the brain. Discomfort could be a general term that could apply to a range of physical discomforts associated with a hangover, but headache is a more specific and common symptom. Shock and get up do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

They are often grazed in meadows or pastures, where there is plenty of grass and other vegetation for them to eat. Therefore, meadow and farm are the most likely answers. School, lamb, and fairgrounds do not have any clear connection to the habitat or behavior of sheep."}

The sentence also mentions that the air is stuffy, which suggests that it is hot and uncomfortable. Therefore, turning a fan on would help to circulate the air and make the living room more comfortable. The other options, such as a hockey game, a football stadium, a bathroom, or a hot room, are not relevant to the context of the sentence."}

The options \"desk drawer,\" \"cabinet,\" and \"classroom\" are stationary locations and do not make sense in the context of walking. \"Purse\" is a possibility, but the sentence does not mention anything about the student carrying a purse. Therefore, the most likely place for the student to store their writing instrument would be in their pocket."}

A \"supermarket\" is a common place to buy household items such as soap, whereas \"washing,\" \"cabinet,\" \"own home,\" and \"sink\" do not make sense as answers to the question."}

This would be commonly found in a liquor store, which specializes in selling alcohol. The other options do not make as much sense or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (e.g. a diaper bag or medicine cabinet would not typically have bottles of alcohol)."}

An atlas is a collection of maps that can help with navigation and finding locations, making it a likely choice for consulting. The other options either don't have a clear connection to the context, like Canada and United States, or are too general, like major cities and book."}

While it is possible for professors to be experts in physics, stating facts, or schooling students, these options are not the primary focus of their job. The image of professors wearing wrinkled tweed jackets may be a cultural stereotype but not relevant to their job duties."}

The other options, such as \"sing a song\" or \"neatness,\" do not seem related to cleaning. \"Allergies\" and \"healthy living\" might be tangentially related to cleaning (e.g. using hypoallergenic cleaning products), but neither is as directly relevant as using water."}

The line was very, very slow.  What was she feeling?"}}, "k": "frustration\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally is waiting in a line that is moving very slowly, which can be a frustrating experience. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. \"Delays\" is too general and doesn't reflect how Sally is feeling, while \"being annoyed\" is too similar to frustration to be a distinct option. \"Moving forward\" and \"progress\" are both more positive options that don't reflect Sally's potential negative feelings about the slow-moving queue."}

As they danced, he  pressed himself against her what?"}}, "k": "rhythmic movement\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James and Holly were dancing together, and that James pressed himself against Holly in a certain way while they danced. The most logical option for what James pressed against Holly would be \"rhythmic movement,\" as this is a common physical sensation experienced while dancing. The other options, such as euphoria or happiness, are not physical sensations that can be pressed against someone, while fatigue would not be associated with dancing."}

The only choice that fits this context is \"newspaper,\" as many people receive a daily newspaper subscription that is delivered to their driveway. The other options (subdivision, street, laundry mat, surface of earth) do not fit the context of the sentence and do not have any clear connection to a daily driveway delivery."}

The mention of energy levels also suggests that the person in question is an athlete, as energy is a critical factor in sports performance. The option \"play sports\" is the most appropriate answer because it directly relates to the context of the sentence, while the other options do not."}

In this case, the most likely candidate for being guarded would be a prisoner, as prisons rely heavily on the presence of guards to keep inmates secure. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. \"Man post\" and \"unprotected\" imply a lack of protection or defense, which would not require a guard. \"Attack\" and \"intimidation\" suggest a more aggressive role than simply guarding, which does not fit the context of the question."}

The most logical place to keep a letter opener would be on a desk, where it can be easily accessed when needed. The other options do not provide a suitable location for storing a letter opener. An office supply store or stationery store would sell letter openers but keeping it there would not be practical. A martyr's chest refers to a medieval chest used to store relics or artifacts and a refrigerator is not a suitable place for storing a letter opener."}

But it was the only place in town that wasn't booked solid for the week and he needed it while he was in town, so he couldn't complain.   Where might this place be?"}}, "k": "hotel\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny needed a place to stay in town and the only available option was expensive and had a mismatch between the carpet and drapes. This description is commonly associated with hotels, as they are known for having various styles and decor options in their rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options are less relevant or appropriate: facing problems and becoming disillusioned are negative experiences that may not lead to positive change, paying bills is a necessary but mundane task, and eating chicken is not related to life transformation."}

They usually find shelter where?"}}, "k": "homes\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that shelter is necessary for survival, and the options presented refer to different possible locations where humans might find shelter. \"Homes\" is the most likely answer, as it's the most common and typical location for people to find shelter. \"Underpass\" could potentially be a location for homeless individuals, but it's not a typical answer for where people find shelter. \"Workplace\" and \"school\" are places people often go during the day, but they are not typically used as long-term shelters. \"Space shuttle\" is an unlikely answer as it only applies to astronauts and is not a typical location for shelter."}

Seeing a bear is potentially dangerous and frightening, while seeing beautiful views can be enjoyable and awe-inspiring. Getting wet can be uncomfortable, especially if the person is not prepared with proper clothing or gear. Getting lost can be stressful and possibly dangerous, as the person may not be able to find their way back to civilization. The last option, \"murdered by a landshark,\" is not a realistic or plausible outcome in the context of the sentence."}

He thought that exercise is the best way to lose weight because you can't get rid of what?"}}, "k": "need for food\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim believes exercise is the best way to lose weight, possibly because it helps control his appetite. The phrase \"you can't get rid of\" implies that the thing being referenced is an inherent part of the weight loss process. Fitness and sweating may help with weight loss, but they are not directly related to appetite control. Fast food and thirst are also unrelated to the sentence's context."}

The word \"artificial\" means something that is made by humans, as opposed to natural. Therefore, it is the most logical choice as a contrast to nature's structures. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not contrast with nature's structures."}

The most common transformation that occurs when water is exposed to cold temperatures is that it freezes and becomes snow. Typhoons are large, tropical storms that form in warm waters, so they are not related to the cold temperatures mentioned in the question. Laddle is a tool used for scooping liquids or substances, so it does not relate to the context of the sentence. Teardrops are related to emotions and crying, so they are not related to the scientific process of water freezing. Sink is an object that goes underwater, so it is not related to the context of the sentence either."}

While snoring and dreaming may occur during sleep, they are not indicative of what happens to the body as a whole. Latency refers to the time it takes to fall asleep and is not a physical change in the body. Dreaming is a separate process from the initial act of falling asleep. Relaxation, on the other hand, is a common physiological change that occurs as the body prepares to rest. This includes a drop in heart rate, breathing rate, and muscle tension, as well as a decrease in brain activity."}

The other options do not relate to a direction that is higher or above."}

Envy and jealousy involve negative feelings towards others, and fear wouldn't typically be associated with seeing presents at a party. Education also doesn't fit the context. Excitement, on the other hand, is a natural response to receiving or seeing new presents at a celebration, making it the most appropriate answer choice."}

Where might it have jumped?"}}, "k": "microwave\nKnowledge: The sentence describes Joe's reaction to his cat jumping into something, causing him to panic and fear for its life. The mention of the word \"delicious\" suggests that the cat smelled food, and the unusual level of panic indicates that the cat jumped into a dangerous place. The option \"microwave\" is the only one that fits the criteria of both being a place where food can be heated and a potential danger to a cat, as being inside a running microwave can be fatal to animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

It was very what?"}}, "k": "uneven\nKnowledge: The sentence clearly states that the table was not level and that some parts were higher and some were lower with no rhyme or reason. The word \"uneven\" specifically describes this situation, making it the correct choice. \"Build evenly\" suggests that the table was intentionally made that way, which is not the case in this sentence. \"Unbalanced\" and \"tilted\" could be correct in other contexts, but do not fully capture the idea expressed here. \"Electrical circuit\" does not relate to the context of the sentence at all."}

He was really troubled  and fearful because of what?"}}, "k": "prosecution\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James knew that murder was wrong, but still considered doing it because he thought he could get away with it. This implies that he was aware of the legal consequences of murder and the possibility of being prosecuted for it. Therefore, he was fearful and troubled by the prospect of facing prosecution for his actions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Water, ocean, harbor, and river are all bodies of water that would require navigation skills to operate a boat safely. A garage, on the other hand, is not a body of water and therefore would not require navigation skills to operate a boat."}

The use of the word \"personal\" implies that it is something that is typically associated with individual feelings or emotions. Therefore, the only option that makes sense in this context is \"conflict,\" as it suggests that the individual did not have any personal conflicts or issues when it came to making friends. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence."}

The answer is subjective, but the word \"feel\" suggests an emotional response rather than a logical or physical one. The choices all offer emotions that are commonly associated with helping others, but \"satisfaction\" is the most appropriate answer as it describes a feeling of fulfillment or accomplishment that comes from helping others in need. The other options, such as \"boredom\" or \"happiness,\" do not fit with the context of helping the needy."}

He gets them from where?"}}, "k": "refrigerator\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Paul already has the carrots he wants, and he doesn't have to go anywhere to get them. This indicates that the carrots are likely already in his possession, and the most logical place for them to be is in his refrigerator. The other options, such as the store or farmer's market, suggest that Paul would need to go somewhere to acquire the carrots. The dryer option is clearly an absurd and incorrect choice as it is used for drying clothes, not storing vegetables."}

The most likely place for this to happen is on a table where food is being consumed. The other options do not make sense in this context, as sailboats, desks, closets, and apartments are not typically associated with eating or messiness."}

Life partner is a common desire for many people as human beings are social animals and crave companionship. Money is also a common desire as it provides financial security and the ability to afford basic necessities and luxuries. Larger house and second chances are subjective desires that not everyone may want or need. Headache is not a desire but rather an unwanted physical condition."}

Birds use a variety of materials, including twigs, grass, and string, to construct their nests and raise their young. Therefore, it is likely that the small flying animal is taking the string to its nest. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Confidence is a common trait associated with people who knowingly deceive others or break the law without fear of punishment.

While it's possible to have a tennis court in a park or a recreational center, an athletic club is more likely to have a tennis court as part of their facilities. A college campus might have a tennis court as well, but it's not as common as an athletic club. The option \"desert\" doesn't make sense in this context."}

Sand box, kitchen cabinet, and table do not have any mechanism for providing water. A waterfall may be too strong to fill a cup and may not be safe for consumption. A water fountain, on the other hand, is specifically designed to provide clean water for drinking and can be easily used to fill a cup."}

The word \"visited\" implies that the subject enjoyed going somewhere, and the context of the sentence suggests that the person's enjoyment was related to the activity they were doing, which was playing video games. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The most likely connection is the apocryphal story about George Washington chopping down a cherry tree and then telling the truth about it, in which he is said to have climbed a ladder to reach the tree.

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A fish market might sell blowfish, but the sentence is not referring to buying one. The jungle is a land-based environment and is unlikely to have an aquatic animal like a blowfish. Sea water is a possibility, but it is too broad of a term without more context, whereas body of water is more specific and implies a lake, river, or ocean.

The most common place for people to store money that they plan on using in the short term is their pocket. The other options, such as a cash drawer or safety deposit box, are not practical for immediate use, and a piggy bank is typically used for saving money, rather than spending it. While a bank may be a valid option for obtaining cash to use later, the question specifically asks where to put the dollar, rather than where to obtain additional funds."}

An airplane fits this description, as it typically flies at high altitudes. The other options either move closer to the ground or have a structure (such as a windshield) that would allow bugs to reach them."}

The term \"mall store\" narrows down the options to stores that are typically found in shopping malls. The option \"clothing store\" is too general, as most mall stores sell clothing. The options \"bedroom\" and \"apartment\" are not stores at all. The option \"thrift store\" may sell inexpensive clothing, but it is less likely to carry new jeans from popular brands.

If they have faced numerous challenges and setbacks without seeing any improvement, they may become disheartened and lose motivation to keep trying. The other options do not necessarily imply a loss of interest in one's own problems."}

What might he have bee on?"}}, "k": "sandplain\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John was riding on a flat, open area until he reached the ocean. A sandplain is a flat or gently sloping area covered in sand, which would fit the description provided in the sentence. The other options, such as a mountain, fancy, cliff, or gorge, all describe features that have significant elevation changes, which would make it unlikely that John could ride a plain over them all the way to the ocean."}

The word \"passion\" also implies a strong emotional connection to the activity, further reinforcing the idea that they were involved in something they loved. The other options, such as opera, television or blockbuster feature, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer."}

However, they are not typically stored in these locations, as they are often rented or brought specifically for the occasion. The other options, such as city hall, closet, garage, or school, are all indoor locations where chairs may be stored or used, but a folding chair may not be the most appropriate option."}

Calluses are thickened, hardened skin that develops as a protective response to pressure and friction on the skin. Therefore, it is the most likely consequence of spending a long time shopping in uncomfortable shoes. The other options, such as tiredness or sleepiness, may be related to the physical strain of standing for a long time, but they do not specifically relate to the feet. Bankruptcy and standing in line are not related to the physical consequences of wearing uncomfortable shoes."}

The term \"inferior\" implies that the noble citizen considered themselves to be of a higher social status than those with a lower status. \"Loser\" and \"ignoble\" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of discussing beliefs towards lower social status. \"Peasant\" and \"plebeian\" may refer to lower social classes in Rome but do not necessarily convey the idea of inferiority."}

He noticed that its carpet was stained with sauces and ketchup. What type of business might that be?"}}, "k": "restaurant\nKnowledge: The presence of stained carpets with sauces and ketchup is a common occurrence in restaurants due to spills and accidents that happen in the dining area. The other options, such as bedroom, chair, bowling alley, and hotel do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or do not involve the likelihood of spilled food."}

The other choices are not relevant to the context of buying beer. \"Have no money\" would prevent someone from buying beer, \"pants\" and \"relaxation\" are not related to buying beer, and \"lose money\" implies that the person is not intentionally trying to buy beer, but is losing money in some other way."}

Therefore, the best solution would be to increase their income by making more money. The other options, such as knowing everything or throwing a party, do not address the problem of not being able to pay bills. Acknowledgment may be necessary but is not a solution, while spare time is irrelevant."}

The option \"healthy\" is the most general and all-encompassing option, as exercising can benefit overall health by improving cardiovascular health, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting mental well-being. While losing weight and getting in shape are commonly associated with exercising, they are more specific benefits that may not be applicable to everyone. The option \"sweat\" is not a benefit of exercising but rather a side effect of physical exertion."}

The word \"possible\" indicates that there was some chance of the thing happening, but Steve's agreement suggests that it was not very likely. The word \"unlikely\" fits best with this context. The other options suggest a stronger sense of impossibility or inability, which does not seem to be what Steve was expressing."}

The mention of a Japanese restaurant suggests that the answer will be a neighborhood with a significant Japanese community, and the word \"region\" implies a specific area within the city. California and Tokio are not specific neighborhoods within a city, and Narnia is a fictional location. Large town may refer to many different cities or neighborhoods, but does not provide any specific information about where a Japanese restaurant may be located."}

Intimidation is a tactic where someone tries to create fear or anxiety in another person, which can make it difficult for them to focus or feel comfortable learning. On the other hand, the other options are more likely to be positive or neutral approaches to learning, such as repetition to reinforce knowledge, a sense of wonder to encourage curiosity, accidents as opportunities for exploration, or increased knowledge as a desirable outcome."}

While getting married may be a result of falling in love, it is not a universal experience and not all people who fall in love get married. Pain and suffering are also possible outcomes of love, but they are not the most common or expected emotions associated with it."}

Zoos are a common place where animals are kept in captivity for public observation and are often criticized for their impact on animal welfare. The other options, such as jungle (where animals typically live free in the wild), kill (which does not make sense in the context of the sentence), india (which is a location but not related to the sentence), and eat cake (which is a joke answer) do not fit the context of the sentence."}

The phrase usually implies a sense of loyalty and companionship, which is why the correct answer is \"very loyal.\" While dogs can have different personalities and intelligence levels, none of the other options directly relate to the phrase \"man's best friend.\""}

The other options such as boat and train station do not make sense in the context of the question, while michigan and trunk of car are not places where you can buy a bicycle."}

Among the choices, space is the most logical answer, as it is the location where aliens are commonly depicted in science fiction, and where a vacuum would be necessary for various reasons, such as maintaining air pressure or removing debris. The other options, such as closet, kitchen, orbit, and container do not make as much sense in the context of the question."}

The characteristics of each choice can help narrow down the correct answer. Goats are often considered to be followers in a herd, as they tend to follow behind the leader. Lions are typically viewed as leaders rather than followers, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Wolves may follow a pack order, but they are also known for being independent and solitary hunters. Expensive and meadow are not animals and do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Additionally, the phrase \"supposed to\" implies that the soldier was given a specific purpose for going to the rendezvous point, and that purpose is likely to be fulfilled by waiting for further instructions rather than immediately engaging in combat. The other answer choices may be plausible in other contexts, but they do not fit the specific language used in this sentence."}

The word \"painful\" is commonly associated with feelings of sadness, grief, and loss. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - \"happy\" and \"bring joy\" are the opposite of the sentiment expressed in the sentence, \"blind\" is unrelated to emotions, and \"contagious\" is not a feeling."}

The choices \"backpack\" and \"bank\" do not make sense in this context. \"Eat cake\" is completely unrelated to the question. The option \"office desk\" could be a possible answer, but \"desk drawer\" specifically refers to a place to store items when not in use, making it the most logical choice."}

To him, the truth didn't do what what?"}}, "k": "matter to\nKnowledge: The context suggests that James was not concerned with the truth and did not prioritize it. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a choice that reflects a lack of importance given to the truth. \"Matter to\" implies that the truth was not significant or relevant to James, which fits the given context. The other options do not necessarily reflect a lack of importance given to the truth."}

This is a common characteristic of subdivisions, which are planned communities consisting of similar homes and landscaping. The other options, such as a city or parking garage, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not typically have uniform yards or landscaping. The option \"three feet\" does not make sense in relation to the question. Michigan may have subdivisions, but the sentence does not provide any specific information about the location the speaker is looking for."}

These environments are equipped with the necessary equipment and resources to conduct such experiments. The other options, such as a coat pocket or bordello, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and would not be appropriate settings for distilling elements."}

In order to help him calm down and regain control of his emotions, he was likely encouraged to \"cool off.\" This phrase means to take a break, step away from the situation, and allow time for the angry feelings to dissipate. The other options either involve physical aggression (punch, fight) or do not address the need for emotional regulation (illustrate point, release energy)."}

Math class and math book are not relevant, as they don't involve music. Pythagoras was a famous mathematician, not a musician, so being in his band is not a plausible scenario. Orchestra is a close option, but it may not necessarily include learning how to play a triangle specifically. Therefore, music class is the most appropriate choice, as it would likely cover a broad range of musical skills, including playing percussion instruments like the triangle."}

The phrase \"rather than going to the movies\" implies that they had options for how to spend their time, and chose the one that allowed them to socialize and connect with each other. The options \"competition\" and \"losing money\" imply a more intense or negative experience, whereas \"fun game\" and \"fun\" do not capture the social aspect of the activity as well as \"social event.\""}

He did this because he was what than ever before?"}}, "k": "drunker\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that Dan fell off a bar stool, which suggests that he may have been sitting at a bar or in some other drinking establishment. The next part of the sentence suggests that the reason Dan fell off the stool was because he was \"drunker\" than ever before. This implies that Dan had consumed a significant amount of alcohol, which affected his balance and coordination. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

This is typically done by sanding the wood with sandpaper until the roughness has been removed. Petrifying wood means turning it into stone, which is not relevant in this context. Warping wood means twisting or bending it out of shape, which is not a solution to make the wood smooth. Composting wood means turning it into organic matter, which is not relevant in this context. Cleaning wood may remove surface dirt, but it will not make the wood smooth to the touch."}

The choice of words such as \"tribe\" and \"Indian\" support this association, while the other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. Additionally, the sentence implies that the chief was the sole survivor of the tribe, which emphasizes the tragedy and loss he experienced."}

None of the other options have any clear association with causing illness. \"Boat\" and \"kitchen\" are objects and \"necessary to live\" and \"edible\" describe characteristics that do not necessarily indicate if a food is harmful or not. \"Unhealthy\" directly suggests that a type of food is not good for one's health and can cause sickness."}

Therefore, the sharpest parts of the triangle (the points with the smallest angle measurement) would be located at the three vertices. The point, on the other hand, refers to a single location in space and does not necessarily have any connection to the shape of a triangle. The math book is not a relevant option, as it does not relate to the concept being discussed. The options \"3 sides\" and \"three sides\" are essentially the same, but the use of the numeral \"3\" is more appropriate in this context."}

Garages, driveways, and repair shops are not typically located next to freeways and would not provide direct access onto the road. Stop lights are more commonly found on local roads and would not be used to exit a freeway. The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to navigation and transportation on a roadway."}

This is because sex is often associated with physical exertion and relaxation, which makes it easier to fall asleep afterwards. The other options are unlikely to be the outcome of having sex with one's spouse, as they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

If she pushed more what might happen?"}}, "k": "pressure\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally believes there is a risk involved in competing, which may lead to added pressure. If she were to push more, it is likely that she would feel more pressure to succeed in her efforts. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence."}

What is the function of the place he is most likely at?"}}, "k": "toilet or restroom\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that John is sitting in a toilet stall in a bathroom and can hear cars going around in circles outside, which suggests that he is in an enclosed and private space typically used for personal hygiene purposes. The other options (eating food, public place, race track, at hotel, public building) are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not explain why John would be hearing cars going around in circles."}

Options like \"park\" and \"rest area\" do not require tickets and do not have reserved seating available. \"Movies\" do have assigned seating at some theaters, but it is not commonly referred to as buying tickets for seats. The options \"auditorium\" and \"show\" are more likely to have assigned seating and require tickets for entry. \"Show\" specifically refers to a performance or entertainment event, while \"auditorium\" can be used for various events, but often refers to a performance space."}

A mall is a location where many people go to shop, making it a high-traffic location for businesses. The other options, such as \"business\" and \"store,\" are too broad and do not specifically indicate a space with high foot traffic. \"Sale\" and \"sell goods\" are not locations at all, but rather actions related to selling."}

The phrase \"sharing of ideas\" is commonly associated with workplace communication where colleagues discuss their thoughts and insights related to work-related topics. The other options such as coughing, speaking, and sneezing are generic actions that may occur during workplace communication but are not specific to the act of exchanging ideas.

The other options listed are physical objects or actions, rather than emotions. While fists and hands are necessary body parts to punch, they do not explain the root cause of the action, which is typically anger or aggression. Boxing gloves may be associated with punching, but they do not necessarily cause the emotion that leads to it."}

The word \"differently\" implies that they should try doing things in a new or different way. The other options - \"otherwise\", \"expensive\", \"only\", and \"mere\" - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Given that the other options do not involve bodies of water, Tamales Bay is the most plausible location for a shark to be found before it was caught. Tamales Bay is an inlet in California that connects to the Pacific Ocean and is known to be home to many different species of marine life including sharks."}

The correct answer is an option that aligns with the idea of having fun without any negative consequences. Falling down, tripping, or falling down do not fit with an enjoyable dance experience, and therefore can be eliminated. Celebrate is too broad of an option and not specific to dance, leaving move around as the only fitting choice."}

The only option that aligns with this context is \"prison sentence.\" \"Feelings of guilt\" might be a natural consequence of such an action, but it is not a legal consequence. \"Terrible\" and \"die\" are not appropriate outcomes for the crime of murder. \"Encouragement\" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence."}

This is further supported by the options \"joy\" and \"laughter,\" which are also related to the act of laughing. However, the option \"humor\" is the best fit as it directly relates to the situation described in the sentence. A good sense of humor means that someone has the ability to find things funny, which would explain why they laugh after being surprised. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

It was the closest thing they had to what?"}}, "k": "park\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that people were playing games in a specific location and that location was similar to something else. The options \"town\", \"beach\", and \"near\" don't really fit because they don't describe a specific type of location. \"Outside\" is too vague and doesn't describe a specific place. \"Park\" is the best option because it is a specific type of location where people often play games, making it the closest thing to the soccer field where the games were being played."}

The term \"work out\" refers to any type of physical activity that is done with the intention of improving one's health and fitness, so it makes the most sense as the correct answer.

Tails, eyes, heads, and bodies do not have any clear connection to this idea, whereas bones can be lightweight and hollow in certain animals. This characteristic can help them reduce overall weight and increase their ability to fly or glide."}

The phrase \"it was all pretend\" implies that the child feels like everyone else is pretending or fooling themselves. The option \"people believe\" directly relates to this context, as it suggests the child is struggling with understanding why others believe in something that feels fake to them. The other options, such as daydreams, transcendentalism, laughter, and religion, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The options \"field,\" \"restaurant,\" and \"salad\" do not fit this context, as they do not typically sell packaged or bottled grape juice. \"Food store\" could be a viable option, but \"market\" is a more general term that can refer to a variety of food vendors or stalls, making it a more likely answer."}

While Manhattan and major cities may also have a high concentration of nightclubs, the option \"downtown area\" is the most specific and directly related to the context of the question. The options \"drink and dance\" and \"alcohol\" are not relevant as they do not refer to specific locations."}

While humans are capable of answering questions and flying (with the aid of technology), machines are specifically designed for performing work and can do so in a more efficient and consistent manner than humans. The option \"fail to work\" is not a characteristic unique to machines, as humans can also fail to work due to various reasons. \"See work\" is also a vague option with no clear explanation or context provided."}

The options \"house,\" \"home,\" and \"pool house\" are too broad and do not provide any specific information about the location of the linen closet. The option \"bedroom\" may be a possibility, but the phrase \"really needs repainting a light color\" suggests that the area is larger than just a bedroom. The best option is \"hallway,\" which is a space often used to connect rooms in a house and may have only one overhead light."}

Nests provide birds with shelter and protection for their young, and they are often located in trees or other elevated locations. The other options are not likely locations for a bird's home. Forests may offer nesting sites, but the option specifically says \"forest\" instead of \"trees\" or \"wooded areas,\" making it less likely to be the correct answer. Roof and sky do not typically have natural materials suitable for building a nest, and leaves would not provide sufficient shelter or protection."}

A stock certificate is a legal document that represents ownership in a company and can have significant value, especially if the company is successful like Apple Inc. The other options do not have any clear connection to Apple Inc or the concept of value."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "8b2af2d865b7dc500427786c846eacaf", "question": {"question_concept": "motion", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "being still"}, {"label": "B", "text": "silence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stationary"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stillness"}, {"label": "E", "text": "standing still"}], "stem": "During the winter hunt he could hear every motion in the woods, this was because of the what of everything?"}}, "k": "stillness\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker was able to hear everything in the woods because of the stillness of everything. Being still, stationary, standing still, and being silent can all contribute to stillness, but stillness is the specific word used in the sentence to describe the lack of motion in the woods."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "383282aace64dd49138bac2392f8b38e", "question": {"question_concept": "radio", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "trunk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bedroom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "diner"}, {"label": "D", "text": "space shuttle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "shop"}], "stem": "If a car-less person want to listen to talk radio in private, where might they listen to it?"}}, "k": "bedroom\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to listen to talk radio in private, which implies that they do not want others around them to hear it. Among the choices provided, the only option that offers privacy is the bedroom. The trunk, diner, space shuttle, and shop do not provide a private listening environment for the person."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "eaf6838d29bcd4ebf408da2f75aa65c3", "question": {"question_concept": "world", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "diverse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "round"}, {"label": "C", "text": "square"}, {"label": "D", "text": "orange"}, {"label": "E", "text": "complicated"}], "stem": "Billy was an astronaut.  When he looked at the world from space, how did it look?"}}, "k": "round\nKnowledge: Based on the context of the sentence, Billy is an astronaut, and when he looked at the world from space, it suggests that he could see the whole planet. The common perception of the Earth is that it is round, which is the answer choice that fits best with the context. The other answer choices do not fit with the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "7c8bc9c0e56389eef033bca40c88c151", "question": {"question_concept": "fireplace", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "big house"}, {"label": "B", "text": "train"}, {"label": "C", "text": "cabin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "living room"}, {"label": "E", "text": "home"}], "stem": "Where is a good place to have a fireplace in a house?"}}, "k": "living room\nKnowledge: A fireplace is a common feature in a living room, which is often the central gathering place in a home. A big house or cabin may have multiple fireplaces throughout, but the living room is a typical location for a fireplace. A train or home are not typical settings for a fireplace, and do not provide much context for the question."}

Cats and dogs are often seen as natural enemies, and it is not uncommon for dogs to attack or even kill cats. Therefore, finding your cat in a dog's mouth would be the worst possible scenario for a cat owner. The other options, such as trouble, backyard, nature, or home, do not necessarily imply a danger to the cat."}

Of the choices given, only New York City and Jewish neighborhoods specifically mention Jewish communities, making them the most likely options. However, the fact that the sentence mentions \"a number of different places to eat\" suggests that the deli is located in a more general area with multiple food options, which makes New York City the most likely answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "d725f1c2e150a3221de31612123f3f46", "question": {"question_concept": "going to market", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "buy food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "see other people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "buying vegetables"}, {"label": "D", "text": "buy a fat pig"}, {"label": "E", "text": "traveling"}], "stem": "What do you do when you're going to market?"}}, "k": "buying vegetables\nKnowledge: The phrase \"going to market\" traditionally refers to a trip to a local market to purchase goods, typically food. The phrase \"buying vegetables\" is the most specific and relevant choice to this context, as it is a common item people purchase at markets. \"Buy food\" and \"buy a fat pig\" are also possible choices, but they are more general and do not specifically indicate a trip to the market. \"See other people\" and \"traveling\" are unlikely choices because they do not connect to the context of purchasing goods at a market."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "f7735d721dfdc94621154951d4eaa4cf", "question": {"question_concept": "discovering truth", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "conclusion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "happiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "relief"}, {"label": "E", "text": "boring"}], "stem": "She feared that she had cancer, but upon discovering truth that she hadn't, what was her attitude toward life?"}}, "k": "relief\nKnowledge: The sentence indicates that the person was worried about having cancer but was eventually reassured that they did not have it. Therefore, it is likely that they would feel relieved and grateful for this news, rather than feeling bored or concluding something else. Pain may have been a potential outcome if they had developed cancer, but that is not the case in this sentence. Happiness could be a possible emotional response, but given the situation, relief is the more appropriate choice."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "eaf980db7e945b1cf6d648fa55ddcb5e", "question": {"question_concept": "having fun", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "smiling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pleasure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hurt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "injuries"}, {"label": "E", "text": "laughter"}], "stem": "What is the feeling of one having fun?"}}, "k": "pleasure\nKnowledge: Having fun is commonly associated with experiencing pleasure and enjoyment. Smiling and laughter are often outward expressions of pleasure, while hurt and injuries are negative sensations that are not related to the feeling of having fun."}

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A conference room or card room would not be relevant in this situation, while placing a net or moving to a neighbor's house would not solve the problem."}

It is believed that this decision leads to salvation and the promise of eternal life in heaven after death. The other options do not align with this belief or have any connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "23df3bac9cfcb156f4cfd8a05f21c5e2", "question": {"question_concept": "surf", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "wipe out"}, {"label": "B", "text": "enjoy yourself"}, {"label": "C", "text": "start fighting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "get wet"}, {"label": "E", "text": "drown"}], "stem": "James loved to surf but he wasn't good at it. He would always do what?"}}, "k": "wipe out\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James is not skilled at surfing, which means he is likely to fall off his board or wipe out. \"Wipe out\" is a term commonly used in the context of surfing to describe the act of falling off one's surfboard. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "d21777d771dc6fd08e769d378651817e", "question": {"question_concept": "key", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "front door"}, {"label": "B", "text": "turn lock"}, {"label": "C", "text": "solution to problem"}, {"label": "D", "text": "install"}, {"label": "E", "text": "open doors"}], "stem": "Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home.  While she was gone, he used it to do what?"}}, "k": "turn lock\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that Sarah gave her brother a \"guy\", which is likely a typo or a misspelling of \"key\". Keys are commonly used to turn locks to open doors, so the correct answer is \"turn lock\". The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or are too general to apply specifically to the situation described."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "611a4cc0e288b8a11afa923f48cb2ab4", "question": {"question_concept": "mammoth", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "boscage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "forest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "prehistory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "prehistoric times"}, {"label": "E", "text": "ancient times"}], "stem": "When did mammoth's live?"}}, "k": "prehistoric times\nKnowledge: The term \"mammoth\" refers to a group of extinct elephant-like mammals that lived during the prehistoric period. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to periods in the past, such as \"prehistoric times\" or \"ancient times.\" The other options, such as \"boscage\" and \"forest,\" are not specific to any time period and do not provide any contextual clues to the answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "8e7941ce31996ca83cc0a68f7313c96d", "question": {"question_concept": "killing people", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "murder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "remorse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "religious"}, {"label": "D", "text": "retaliation"}, {"label": "E", "text": "anguish"}], "stem": "After killing people, the murderer went to church after feeling what?"}}, "k": "remorse\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the murderer felt a sense of guilt or regret after committing the act of murder, which is often referred to as remorse. This feeling may have led them to seek solace or forgiveness in a religious setting such as a church. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as retaliation would imply the murderer felt one had wronged them, religious would suggest that they went to church for reasons unrelated to their crime, and anguish wouldn't explain why they went to church."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "ea02772e27f5bd40eced3b65e8c6427f", "question": {"question_concept": "committing suicide", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "die"}, {"label": "B", "text": "interruption"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bleed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hatred"}, {"label": "E", "text": "dying"}], "stem": "What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt?"}}, "k": "interruption\nKnowledge: An unsuccessful suicide attempt means that the person did not succeed in taking their own life. Interruption could refer to someone or something stopping the person in the middle of the attempt, such as someone discovering them or a sudden change of heart. Bleeding could happen as a result of the attempt, but does not necessarily mean the attempt was unsuccessful. The options \"die\" and \"dying\" are not appropriate answers as they would refer to a successful attempt, while \"hatred\" is not relevant to the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "de54d03e69d9765872f95ff06ed21499", "question": {"question_concept": "buying products", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "joy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "disagreements"}, {"label": "C", "text": "agony"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pleasure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "owning"}], "stem": "What can happen if you are buying products that someone else does not want you to buy?"}}, "k": "disagreements\nKnowledge: The question suggests that there may be some conflict or negative outcome associated with buying products that someone else does not want you to buy. The word \"disagreements\" suggests that there may be an argument or disagreement between the person buying the product and someone else who does not approve of the purchase. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the question."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "b231a732a3fdf0621391e7e385f8d651", "question": {"question_concept": "getting", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "show appreciation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "asking for"}, {"label": "C", "text": "exchanging"}, {"label": "D", "text": "say thank"}, {"label": "E", "text": "smile"}], "stem": "The child was getting many gifts for his birthday, his father reminded him to do what after opening each one?"}}, "k": "show appreciation\nKnowledge: The father's reminder after each gift suggests that the child needs to do something that shows gratitude towards the gift-giver. Showing appreciation is a common way to acknowledge a gift, and is often expected in social situations. Asking for or exchanging the gift would be considered rude, while simply saying \"thank you\" or smiling may not be seen as sufficient to express gratitude in some cultures."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "b9121c3228f961c5ad68958c702cd94b", "question": {"question_concept": "grass", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "rest area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "desert"}, {"label": "C", "text": "state park"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fairgrounds"}, {"label": "E", "text": "soccer game"}], "stem": "Bob stands in the grass surrounded by trees and nature, where is Bob?"}}, "k": "state park\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob is surrounded by trees and nature, which is a characteristic commonly associated with state parks. State parks are often scenic areas that provide opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking or picnicking, which may explain why Bob is in this location. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "4015ab002ff8c233d1c7ef26f5156b88", "question": {"question_concept": "horse", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "circus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "in kentucky"}, {"label": "C", "text": "western movie"}, {"label": "D", "text": "central park"}, {"label": "E", "text": "state fair"}], "stem": "Bart entered his horse into the contest.  Where did he do this?"}}, "k": "state fair\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that Bart entered his horse into a contest, which is typically held at events such as fairs or shows. Of the given options, the state fair is the most likely location for such a contest. The other options, such as a circus or a western movie, do not typically hold horse contests. In Kentucky, there are many horse competitions, but the sentence does not provide any indication that Bart entered his horse in a specific competition in Kentucky. Central Park is in New York City and would not be a typical location for a horse contest."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "0197ade3bb26d163ab2e284c960c626f", "question": {"question_concept": "snowflake", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "cloud"}, {"label": "B", "text": "snow storm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "billow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "air"}, {"label": "E", "text": "snowstorm"}], "stem": "From where does a snowflake form?"}}, "k": "cloud\nKnowledge: Snowflakes form in clouds when water vapor freezes onto tiny particles, such as dust, that are floating in the air. This process is known as nucleation. As more and more water vapor freezes onto the particle, it builds up into a crystal, which eventually falls to the ground as a snowflake. The other choices may be related to snow, but they do not accurately describe the formation process of a snowflake."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "a90f9197a13c64089c9ba95bcba275ad", "question": {"question_concept": "drill", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "basement"}, {"label": "B", "text": "work shop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tool shed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "repair shop"}, {"label": "E", "text": "store room"}], "stem": "All the power tools like the drill used for fixing cars made for a very loud workplace where?"}}, "k": "repair shop\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions power tools and fixing cars, which suggests that the location is likely a place where vehicles are repaired. The term \"workplace\" also suggests that this is a professional environment, rather than a personal one (such as a basement or tool shed). The most appropriate location from the given options is a repair shop, where mechanics would use power tools like drills to fix cars. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "684204df916cc58d47293960f9c6ed9f", "question": {"question_concept": "applying for job", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "working hard"}, {"label": "B", "text": "frustration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "rejection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "defeat"}, {"label": "E", "text": "stress"}], "stem": "Applying for a job can make someone feel what sort of emotion, even if they get it?"}}, "k": "stress\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that applying for a job can have a negative emotional impact, even if the person gets the job. The word \"even\" implies that getting the job does not necessarily eliminate the negative emotion. Stress is a common emotion associated with job applications because of the pressure of the job search process and the potential impact it can have on an individual's future. The other options do not have the same association with job applications and are less likely to be the correct answer."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "a2aa95861ef74bf1ecfc55db505e3982", "question": {"question_concept": "weasel", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "chicken coop"}, {"label": "B", "text": "beach"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fairytale"}, {"label": "D", "text": "great outdoors"}, {"label": "E", "text": "corn fields"}], "stem": "A farmer sees a weasel in the woods, where is the farmer?"}}, "k": "great outdoors\nKnowledge: The sentence mentions that the farmer sees a weasel in the woods, which suggests that the setting is outside in a natural environment. Of the given choices, \"great outdoors\" is the only option that matches this description. The other options (chicken coop, beach, fairytale, corn fields) do not fit the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "8555dd9667d010018961a2f7d1c22704", "question": {"question_concept": "pebble", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "manual"}, {"label": "B", "text": "lake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "aquarium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pond"}, {"label": "E", "text": "playground"}], "stem": "He picked up the perfect pebble, he planned to skip it across the entire small what?"}}, "k": "pond\nKnowledge: Skipping stones is a common activity done on bodies of water, particularly shallow ones like ponds. A lake and an aquarium are unlikely choices, as they are either too big or too small for this activity. A manual refers to a collection of instructions or a guidebook, while a playground is not typically associated with skipping stones."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "84a761f516efce04ab27d7ca8dd25255", "question": {"question_concept": "traveling", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "going somewhere"}, {"label": "B", "text": "exhilarating"}, {"label": "C", "text": "diarrhea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "relocation"}, {"label": "E", "text": "exhausting"}], "stem": "Traveling from new place to new place is likely to be what?"}}, "k": "exhausting\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of traveling from one new place to another is being described. The word \"likely\" implies that the answer choice reflects a common experience associated with this type of travel. The option \"exhausting\" is a common experience associated with frequent travel, as it often involves long periods of sitting, uncomfortable sleeping arrangements, and jet lag. The other options do not reflect common experiences associated with this type of travel."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "45a6becd307342669d9d17474e50b97a", "question": {"question_concept": "turkey", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "middle east"}, {"label": "B", "text": "oven"}, {"label": "C", "text": "balkan peninsula"}, {"label": "D", "text": "provide meat"}, {"label": "E", "text": "asia minor"}], "stem": "Turkey only has a small northern part of their country located in part of the what?"}}, "k": "balkan peninsula\nKnowledge: The sentence implies that Turkey has a small area in the north that is part of a larger region or area. The Balkan Peninsula is a well-known geographic region in southeastern Europe, and Turkey does indeed have a small section of land in the northern Balkans (Thrace). The other options (middle east, oven, provide meat, Asia Minor) have no clear connection to the geography of Turkey described in the sentence."}

The most logical place to store a personal item like this would be in one's own home. The other options - supermarket, mart, obesity, and closet - do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not places where one would typically store their own personal belongings."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "77ddc9134bb27f9962aa2ed5ec5a5ef9", "question": {"question_concept": "fun", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "fairgrounds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "watching television"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tired"}, {"label": "D", "text": "enjoyable"}, {"label": "E", "text": "friend's house"}], "stem": "How could you have fun by yourself with no one around you?"}}, "k": "enjoyable\nKnowledge: The question is asking for an activity that can be done alone and still be enjoyable. The options \"fairgrounds\" and \"friend's house\" suggest social activities, which wouldn't meet the criteria of being alone. \"Watching television\" may be an option for some, but it doesn't necessarily imply having fun. \"Tired\" is not an activity or something that can bring enjoyment. \"Enjoyable\" is the most appropriate option as it suggests an activity that can be done alone and enjoyed."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "715583129369c0c5c9f499c93a1c095e", "question": {"question_concept": "potato", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "vegans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "kitchen cupboard"}, {"label": "C", "text": "restaurants"}, {"label": "D", "text": "chicken"}, {"label": "E", "text": "maryland"}], "stem": "The potato might be the official vegetable of what?"}}, "k": "Maryland\nKnowledge: This question requires some external knowledge, as there is no clear context given in the sentence. One way to approach it would be to think about famous agriculture or food products associated with different states or regions. In this case, Maryland is known for its prominent role in the history of the potato industry, with the state's Eastern Shore being a major producer of seed potatoes. Therefore, it is likely that the potato is considered to be the official vegetable of Maryland. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "B", "id": "a478e8b7c049781574f7fbb11ba1eec0", "question": {"question_concept": "sky", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "planetarium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "outdoors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "atmosphere"}, {"label": "D", "text": "night"}, {"label": "E", "text": "photo"}], "stem": "Where is the sky most beautiful?"}}, "k": "outdoors\nKnowledge: The question is asking about the location where the sky is most beautiful, which implies a physical setting. The planetarium and photo options may show beautiful skies, but they are not actual locations. The atmosphere is too broad of a term to be a specific location, and night could refer to any outdoor location where the sky is visible.

This feature is due to the fruit's natural tissue structure, which allows for easy separation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

Although all of the choices may be possible outcomes of overexertion, passing out is commonly associated with pushing oneself too hard during exercise. Marathon runners may experience decreased blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting or passing out. The other options are not likely to occur in this context."}

He was good at it.  But he was rattled ever since his father experienced what?"}}, "k": "death\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's father experienced something traumatic that has affected him since then.

Staying in bed can help as it allows the body to generate and retain heat. The other options are unlikely to help the person warm up, and some (like laying on ice or spitting) may actually make them colder. Lighting a fire may help, but it may not be practical or feasible in all situations."}

The choice \"skin irritation\" makes the most sense, as sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and syphilis can cause skin irritation and other discomforts. The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence and would not make logical sense."}

While cinema, movies, and show can refer to forms of entertainment that are performed live, they are not typically associated with clapping as a form of audience feedback. Hockey games may involve applause, but it is not the primary reason that people attend them. Theatre, on the other hand, is a traditional and well-known form of live entertainment that often involves applause as a way to show appreciation for actors and performers."}

The options \"orchestra,\" \"buy music,\" and \"symphony\" do not make sense in the context of obtaining an instrument, while \"make music\" implies creating your own balalaika from scratch rather than obtaining one. This leaves \"music store,\" which is a common place to purchase musical instruments."}

The other choices, such as \"homely\" or \"misshapen,\" do not have anything to do with clouds or weather."}

From the context, it can be inferred that the demands need to be reasonable in order to be accepted by the employer and to ultimately bring an end to the strike. The other options do not make sense within the context of the question, such as \"not go to work\" which would not be a demand that unions would make since they are already not working due to the strike."}

The other options - park, field, and balloon - are unlikely choices for something that involves carefully placing stones, while \"made from rocks\" is too vague to be a clear choice."}

He and his wife drifted apart.     All and all, recent turns could be described as what?"}}, "k": "unfortunate\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John's marriage is not going well, and he and his wife have grown apart. This indicates that recent turns in their relationship have been negative, which aligns with the option \"unfortunate.\" The other options do not accurately describe the situation. \"Inappropriate\" and \"unsatisfied\" are too vague and do not provide enough context to be correct. \"Sadness\" is an emotion and not a description of recent events, and \"disenchanted\" implies that John was once enchanted with his marriage, which is not indicated in the sentence."}

The word \"crucial\" means essential or vital, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the relationship between the light and finishing homework."}

The other options, such as clerk or movie theater, do not necessarily suggest a concert or performance, and while concerts can be held indoors or in an auditorium, those terms are not specific enough to indicate a ticket booth and a concert together."}

Europe, Germany, and industrialized countries are too broad and do not specifically refer to a superhighway with no speed limit. America has some famous highways but no superhighway with no speed limit. Therefore, the correct answer must be city."}

The options \"ocean\" and \"gallbladder\" do not make sense in this context, as the former is a large body of water and the latter is an organ in the human body. While a stone could potentially be found in a driveway, it is less likely to be discovered through a low trickle of water. \"River bed\" is a possible answer, but the use of the word \"trickle\" implies a smaller body of water, making \"creek bed\" the most likely option."}

The options \"ocean water,\" \"table,\" and \"lake\" are not plausible sources of salt. \"Shaker\" may contain salt, but it is not clear whose shaker is being referred to. \"Neighbor's house\" is the most logical option, as borrowing from a neighbor is a common practice and a likely source of salt."}

The term \"very old\" implies that the universe has been around for a significant amount of time, which is consistent with scientific estimates that put the age of the universe at around 13.8 billion years. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - \"infiniverse\" and \"infinite\" imply that the universe is infinite in size, while \"getting younger\" contradicts the scientific understanding that the universe is actually expanding and becoming older. \"Real\" is not a logical alternative."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "D", "id": "a8c284637dabc87745a7eb05d4f7fcbc", "question": {"question_concept": "meteor", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "republic of ireland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sky"}, {"label": "C", "text": "orbit"}, {"label": "D", "text": "universe"}, {"label": "E", "text": "school"}], "stem": "A meteor travels through galaxies which are a part of what?"}}, "k": "universe\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the meteor travels through galaxies, which are a part of something larger. The only option that refers to a larger structure is \"universe.\" The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - the Republic of Ireland is a country, the sky is a part of Earth's atmosphere, orbit refers to the path of an object around another object, and school is a place where students learn."}

One common behavior associated with bullying is making fun of others, so the correct answer is \"made fun of.\" The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question."}

The most appropriate option among the given choices is \"have conversation,\" as it is a common way of getting to know someone better. The other options may involve some form of entertainment or observation, but they do not necessarily imply a personal interaction or connection between two people."}

The other choices do not fit the context of the question. A nursery is a room where an infant or toddler sleeps, plays, and is cared for, and it would not typically contain medication. A ghetto is a poor and crowded urban area, which has no connection to a drug being kept in a bathroom. A cupboard is a storage space for general household items, but it is not specifically used for medication. A pharmacy is a store where prescription drugs and other medical supplies are sold, but it is not typically located in a home bathroom."}

The options \"ram\" and \"wolf\" are not relevant to the context since they are not related to cooking or preparing sheep meat. \"Lamb\" is a type of sheep that is commonly consumed, but it does not give any indication of how it should be cooked. Therefore, \"done\" is the correct answer as it relates to the cooking process and the desired outcome of well-cooked meat."}

While it's possible to study at home in a living room or in a quiet corner of a furniture store, it wouldn't be the norm for most students. Airport terminals and churches are typically not associated with academic pursuits, making them unlikely options for where you would sit while working on an advanced degree."}

The options \"countryside,\" \"michigan,\" \"north dakota,\" and \"illinois\" may all have farming areas within them, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question. \"Farming areas,\" on the other hand, directly relates to the use of land for agriculture, making it the most appropriate answer."}

Among the choices given, \"hope\" is the only emotion that may result from a positive interview experience. \"Offer\" and \"income\" are outcomes of a successful interview, but they are not emotions. \"Rejection\" and \"hostile\" are negative emotions that do not align with the context of the sentence."}

This suggests that the computers are not necessarily improving people's knowledge or cognitive abilities. The answer choice \"advance knowledge\" is the best fit, as it implies that computers should be helping people learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. The other answer choices do not fit as well, as they do not have a clear connection to the idea of computers and knowledge."}

People thought it was haunted.  It was overgrown, there was nothing near it.  It's was far into the what?"}}, "k": "countryside\nKnowledge: The contextual clues suggest that the cottage is located in a remote, isolated area with no other structures nearby. This is typically associated with the countryside, where individual homes are often spread out and surrounded by natural landscapes. The other options, such as mountains or a train, do not fit the description of the setting provided in the sentence."}

While knights also existed in the Middle Ages and were associated with castles, this does not necessarily mean they were always seen as heroes. Chess boards also feature knights, but they are simply game pieces and not associated with any specific heroic qualities. Kid's stories could refer to a variety of different genres and contexts, so it is not clear whether knights would always be portrayed as heroes in this case."}

The most logical option among the choices provided is transit, which includes buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation. The other options, such as the library or locker room, do not require carrying a duffel bag and therefore would not be a likely reason for James to have it with him. The army barracks could be a possibility, but it is less likely given that the sentence does not suggest James is a member of the military."}

Not competing has a defined outcome, but if he competes then what could happen?"}}, "k": "might win\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that James made the decision to compete, which implies that there is a possibility of winning. The option \"perform better\" is too vague and does not provide a clear outcome of competing. \"Enemies\" does not logically follow from the information presented, and \"winners and losers\" simply restates the concept of competition without providing a specific outcome for James. \"Lose\" is a possible outcome, but the sentence implies that James chose to take a risk by competing, suggesting that there is a potential for reward as well."}

Taxis are commonly used to transport people to airports, so this is the most likely answer. The other options are not relevant or appropriate choices for accessing airplanes."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "52ab95f9216f1994e37cc08f7f258f13", "question": {"question_concept": "driving", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "lack of fuel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "paint scratching"}, {"label": "C", "text": "wheels turning"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tire wear"}, {"label": "E", "text": "traffic accident"}], "stem": "What happens when driving?"}}, "k": "traffic accident\nKnowledge: The question asks about what happens when driving, and all of the choices could technically happen while driving. However, the context of the question suggests that the answer should be the most negative consequence that could occur while driving. While the other options may be inconvenient or annoying, a traffic accident is the most serious and potentially dangerous outcome of driving."}

This process is called digestion, which involves the work of various organs such as the stomach, liver, pancreas, and intestines. Weight gain may occur if we eat more calories than we burn, but it's not the primary process that occurs after having food. Falling down and gas are not related to the process of digestion. Not feeling hungry may be a result of satiety or fullness, which can occur after digestion is complete."}

Making money, leaving home, and success are typically positive outcomes of work, so they are unlikely to be reasons for avoiding it. Bad mood is also too vague and could be caused by a variety of factors, whereas malaise specifically refers to a feeling of physical or emotional discomfort or unease."}

The other options are not directly related to the act of flying in an airplane. Being a passenger is a result of purchasing a ticket, reading is not essential to flying, adding gas is the responsibility of the airline staff, and running through checklists is done by the pilots and crew, not the passengers."}

The other options do not provide a clear connection to the question, as \"basket\" and \"game\" are not colors and \"dog hair\" is too generic. \"Sun\" may suggest a yellowish hue, but it does not clearly indicate a light shade."}

In order to assert its dominance and intimidate its competitor, the lion would likely have taken an aggressive approach. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - reckless suggests a lack of strategy, bellicose suggests a willingness to fight regardless of the situation, defensive suggests a fear of being attacked, and dauntless suggests fearlessness rather than aggression."}

He was afraid to raise his covers for fear of startling it.  Where might he be?"}}, "k": "bedroom\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that John is in bed, resting and afraid to disturb a snake that is slithering over him. The most likely location for this scenario to take place is in a bedroom, which is typically where people sleep and where a bed would be located. The other options (pet shops, Oklahoma, basement, dreams) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Downtown areas often have a variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance, making it an ideal location for finding a place to eat close to local nightlife. The other options, such as malls and shopping centers, may have food options but are less likely to have a vibrant nightlife scene."}

However, this process is necessary in order to gain something, which indicates that the answer is likely to be a positive outcome. The word \"knowledge\" directly aligns with this idea, as it represents the ultimate goal of studying and learning. The other options, such as fatigue and depression, do not align with the idea of gaining something positive from studying, while \"best way\" is too vague and \"weight\" does not make sense in this context."}

The other options (fever, smoke, laughing, coughing) do not seem relevant to the context of trust and chatting with friends. \"Lie\" is the only option that directly relates to trust and could cause a loss of trust if someone was found out to be lying."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "009a7aabffe0583fc2df46656b29c326", "question": {"question_concept": "fortune", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "eat cake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cookie"}, {"label": "C", "text": "stock market"}, {"label": "D", "text": "real estate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "treasure chest"}], "stem": "He came from old money and had a fortune, but he made new money making shrewd trades where?"}}, "k": "stock market\nKnowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person made their new money through shrewd trades, which is commonly associated with the stock market. Real estate could also be a possibility, but there is no mention of it in the sentence. \"Eat cake\" and \"cookie\" are nonsensical options that have no connection to the context of the sentence. \"Treasure chest\" may suggest riches, but it is not a likely way to make money in the modern world."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "C", "id": "2521b3fe6bfd6aeb91f9107dc7c4fbee", "question": {"question_concept": "animal", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "carrying cargo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "favorite"}, {"label": "C", "text": "ecosystem"}, {"label": "D", "text": "nature"}, {"label": "E", "text": "ecology"}], "stem": "Animals make up a large part of the?"}}, "k": "ecosystem\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that animals play an important role in something larger. \"Ecosystem\" refers to the complex web of interactions that exist between living organisms and their environment. Animals are a crucial component of any ecosystem, as they help to pollinate plants, control pests, and maintain the balance of the food chain. The other options do not fully capture the importance of animals in the natural world."}

The most logical option is a container that can be purchased from various stores. Basements are typically not items that can be purchased at a shop, and the ocean floor is not a location for purchasing storage items. Cardboard boxes could be an option, but they may not be as durable as a container. High school is not relevant to the context of the sentence."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "A", "id": "a2e0f6b5651e5271fcff8d6f5c9adfee", "question": {"question_concept": "eating breakfast", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "heartburn"}, {"label": "B", "text": "overeating"}, {"label": "C", "text": "happiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "being satisfied"}, {"label": "E", "text": "gain energy"}], "stem": "A person with digestion issues eats a meat-filled breakfast, what does he feel?"}}, "k": "heartburn\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has digestion issues and eats a meat-filled breakfast, which can be a trigger for heartburn. Meat is a high-fat food that takes longer to digest and can cause stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest (heartburn). The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of being sentenced to prison. \"Scape jail\" is not a proper grammatical construction, and \"dream of freedom\" and \"become a hairdresser\" do not relate to the legal penalties associated with committing a crime. \"Attempt to escape\" may be something a prisoner may try to do, but it is not what they are sentenced to do."}

And understanding the past helped him with doing what?"}}, "k": "writing down\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that Jesse enjoys remembering the past because it helps him understand it, and understanding the past is helpful for something specific. The option \"writing down\" is the most logical choice because writing down memories or historical events is a common way to document and preserve the past. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence."}

Garden centers specialize in selling plants and gardening supplies, and would likely have a variety of rosebushes to choose from. The other options do not seem relevant to obtaining a rosebush - a pot could be used to plant one, a museum would not sell plants, a formal garden might have rosebushes but would not necessarily offer them for purchase, and a backyard is where one might plant a rosebush, but not where one would obtain one."}
{"data": {"answerKey": "E", "id": "dfa23d3422b7294843447b6950d2b476", "question": {"question_concept": "person", "choices": [{"label": "A", "text": "feel important"}, {"label": "B", "text": "trust himself"}, {"label": "C", "text": "own house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "electrical circuit"}, {"label": "E", "text": "know what time"}], "stem": "What does a person with a what likely do?"}}, "k": "trust himself\nKnowledge: The sentence suggests that having a certain thing may result in a person feeling confident in themselves. The phrase \"trust himself\" implies that the thing is related to self-confidence, which is a common trait of successful individuals. The other options, such as feeling important or owning a house, do not necessarily lead to increased self-confidence or trusting oneself. The options \"electrical circuit\" and \"know what time\" seem unrelated to the context of the sentence."}

While cats also have whiskers, sharp teeth, four legs, and sharp claws, these do not distinguish them from other animals in the same way that their purring does. Purring is a defining characteristic of cats and is often associated with their affectionate and cuddly nature."}

Scotland and brown may be associated with tweed, but they do not provide a clear suggestion on where to find it. Eddie Bauer is a clothing brand but does not specifically specialize in tweed."}

While grapes may be found in a kitchen (such as in a fruit bowl or refrigerator), the most likely place to find a single grape is at a fruit stand, which typically sells a variety of fruits in small quantities. The option 'food' is too broad to give any specific information."}

Additionally, the word \"soothing\" specifically refers to something that has a calming effect, which fits with the idea that the music helped the man to relax. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - coma suggests that the man was unconscious, enjoyable and good or bad are too general, and universal doesn't make sense in this context."}
