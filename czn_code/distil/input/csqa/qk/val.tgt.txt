The sentence suggests that the school had made efforts to change, but despite these efforts, they were still punished with sanctions. The word "ignore" implies that the authorities or whoever imposed the sanctions did not consider the school's efforts to be important or effective. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not convey the idea of disregarding or discounting the school's efforts.
The sentence suggests that Sammy is looking for a place where there are people. Populated areas is the only choice that directly relates to this, as it can refer to areas where there is a high concentration of people living or working. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A race track, the desert, an apartment, and a roadblock may not necessarily have a lot of people around.
The question asks where to find a choker that is not located in a jewelry box or boutique. A choker is a type of necklace worn tightly around the neck, which suggests that the correct answer is "neck." The other options are either places where one would normally find jewelry in a stored or displayed manner, or a type of container specifically designed for storing jewelry.
The sentence suggests that Google Maps and other GPS services have replaced something, which is most likely a physical object or tool that was used for navigation. The word "atlas" refers to a collection of maps or charts, often used as a reference for navigating. This makes it the most likely answer choice, since it highlights the type of resource that has been made redundant by the advent of digital mapping services. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fox was leaving the city, which is not a natural habitat for it, and entering the forest. This indicates that the fox was likely searching for a more suitable living environment, or its natural habitat. The other choices, such as pretty flowers or a storybook, do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while a hen house may be a potential target for a fox's hunting instincts but does not fit the idea of the fox looking for a habitat.
The sentence suggests that the equipment in question requires cable, which is commonly associated with devices that display audiovisual content, such as televisions. Radio Shack is a store that sells electronics products but is not a type of equipment. A substation is a part of an electrical power system and has nothing to do with entertainment equipment. Similarly, a cabinet and desk are pieces of furniture and not types of equipment that require cable.
The sentence mentions that the woman checked in a drawstring bag as her only baggage, which is typically done at airports. The other options (garbage can, military, jewelry store, safe) do not make sense in the context of checking in baggage.
The description of the forgotten leftovers being covered in mold suggests that the correct answer is a place where food is commonly stored and forgotten about. The options "carpet" and "coach" do not make sense as places to store food. "Breadbox" is a possibility, but the word "refrigerator" is specifically mentioned in one of the options, making it the most likely choice.
A blotter is a piece of paper or fabric that is used to absorb any extra ink that may have leaked or spilled from a fountain pen. It is a common tool that is used to keep the ink from smudging or smearing on the paper. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A business restaurant is likely to be located in the business sector, as it caters to professionals and executives who work in the area. The other options may be popular locations for restaurants, but they do not specifically cater to the business clientele. A restaurant in a town could attract locals and tourists, while a restaurant at a hotel may be more geared towards guests, and a restaurant in a mall may attract shoppers. Yellow pages, on the other hand, is a directory service and not a physical location.
The sentence implies that the person is shopping for groceries and has picked up grapes. Just before checking out, it is natural for a person to put their groceries in the grocery cart. The other options do not make sense in the context of grocery shopping.
The sentence suggests that the wife was doing all the work before the divorce, indicating that she may have felt resentful or bitter towards her spouse. Bitterness is a common emotion associated with feeling neglected or unappreciated in a relationship. The other options may also be associated with the end of a marriage, but they do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Johnny is in a peaceful and relaxing environment, which is commonly associated with gardens. Gardens often have benches or other seating areas for visitors to sit and enjoy the scenery, which is consistent with the description of Johnny sitting on a bench to relax. The other options are less likely because they do not typically provide a tranquil atmosphere conducive to relaxation.
The phrase "cooling off" typically refers to a decrease in temperature or a slowing down of one's metabolism. The sentence suggests that James is cooling off too quickly, which could be dangerous if he continues to experience a significant loss of heat. "Revenge," "expansion," "relaxation," and "calm down" are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any information that would help to determine the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the person enjoys the smells coming from a certain room in the house, which is a characteristic commonly associated with kitchens. Kitchens are often places where food is prepared and cooked, so it is likely that there would be many enticing aromas emanating from this space. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The man speaking Cajun suggests a location in Louisiana, as Cajun is a dialect commonly spoken in that state. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "grill" in the sentence suggests that the correct answer is related to cooking outdoors. Of the given options, "barbeque" is the most closely associated with outdoor grilling. The other options, such as "backyard" and "neighbor's house," describe locations rather than cooking methods, while "restaurant" and "crockpot" involve cooking methods that do not typically involve grilling.
The sentence implies that the subject of the question is someone who is already experiencing illness, which rules out options like hospitals, doctors' offices, and heads. The other options are all groups of people who may be more susceptible to illness, but they do not specifically refer to someone who is already sick. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "sick person."
The sentence suggests that while shopping, one would expect to find a place to eat pizza. Pizzerias are often found in food courts in shopping malls, as well as in other locations like urban areas and neighborhoods with large Italian populations (such as Little Italy). However, none of the other options have a direct connection to the context of shopping and pizza.
The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a positive feeling after eating everything on the tasting menu. The word "satisfaction" directly aligns with this idea, as it signifies a sense of contentment or fulfillment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either imply negative feelings or are unrelated.
The sentence suggests that playing soccer for a long time has a negative effect on the body. The word "fatigue" is commonly associated with physical exhaustion after extended activity, which makes it the best choice. "Excitement" and "anger" do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not negative effects. "Hurting" is too specific and doesn't encompass all the different ways playing soccer can affect the body. "Getting tired" is similar to "fatigue" but is not as specific and does not capture the full extent of physical exhaustion.
The sentence suggests that there is a back entrance and implies that there are other options. "Front" is the most logical choice because it is the opposite of "back." "Side" is also a possible option, as it is a common location for secondary entrances. "Main" is a possibility, but it would depend on the context of the sentence and whether "main" is used to describe a specific entrance. "Anterior" and "current" do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that to share files with someone, a connection is required. The options "freeway," "radio," and "electrical circuit" don't match the context of file sharing. "Wires" could be a possible answer, but it is too vague and could refer to different types of wires. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "computer network," which is a logical connection to file sharing.
The sentence suggests that the object being described is a small vehicle that is controlled via a hand throttle and foot pedals. The fact that the object is being controlled via a hand throttle implies that it is a vehicle that moves through water, rather than land or air. The only option that fits this description is a boat. The other options, such as car, airplane, fuel system, or accelerate, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sean is fearful of being caught in a lie. The phrase "lying about the body" implies that Sean is not telling the truth about something serious, possibly even a crime. Therefore, he is likely worried about being found out and facing consequences for his actions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the term "drug kingpin" suggests that the context of the sentence is related to drug trafficking. In this context, "run errands" is likely a code for a specific task, such as collecting money from the dealers. The phrase "take money" is the only option that is directly related to the drug trade and would be a logical task for the dealers to do. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person's body had been active during the day and needed rest as a result. The word "working" is the only option related to physical activity that fits this context. The other options do not necessarily imply sustained physical activity throughout the day.
The sentence implies that there is a high demand for exotic snakes as pets, which suggests that these snakes are being sold in pet shops. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "ditch" and "outdoors" are not places where snakes would typically be sold, and "north america" is not relevant to the sentence. "Shop" could be a possible answer, but without the context of the sentence specifying what kind of shop it is, it is less likely than "pet shops" as an answer.
The sentence suggests that Joe faced legal repercussions from his action, which is commonly associated with a lawsuit. A lawsuit involves a legal complaint filed by one party against another that seeks to recover damages or enforce a legal right. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that cleaning something will prevent glare during a football game. Since football games are typically watched on a screen, the most likely option is a television. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for ways to share something one has in their head. All the provided choices are valid methods of communication that can be used to share one's thoughts and ideas with others. Writing an essay and summarizing main points are examples of written communication, while speaking information involves verbal communication. Organizing thoughts is an initial step in preparing to share information, and having information implies possessing knowledge on a specific topic.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a house that is separated from other places by a gate, which is a characteristic commonly associated with gated communities or subdivisions. These types of communities often have a centralized gate or entrance that restricts access to the area and provides a sense of security to its residents. The other options may not have the same level of privacy or security as a gated community.
The use of the word "canals" suggests that the correct answer is a city or location with a system of waterways. Also, the question narrows the options down to Southern Europe. The cities of Michigan, New York, and Bridge do not have a reputation for canals, while Amsterdam in the Netherlands is located in Northern Europe. Venice, on the other hand, is famous for its complex network of canals and is located in Southern Europe.
The question is asking about a specific step that a camper would need to take before starting to cook food. One essential step would be to light a fire, which is necessary for cooking food over an open flame or on a portable stove. The other options, such as making breakfast or going hiking, are not directly related to the act of cooking food while camping. Packing or bagging may be necessary to bring along cooking equipment and ingredients, but it is not a crucial step in the cooking process. Having a match handy is also important in order to start the fire.
Leaving a piece of paper outside can expose it to moisture, which can cause it to become saturated with water. This can affect the texture and appearance of the paper, making it wrinkled and potentially discolored. The other options are not related to the effects of being left outside.
The sentence suggests that Mark's semen had a change in consistency after his vasectomy. The word "thick" implies that his semen was previously viscous or dense, but the word "but" indicates that there has been a contrast in consistency. The word "thin" is the most appropriate choice to convey this shift in texture. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a place to lay in the sun, which suggests an outdoor location with plenty of sunlight. The option "beach" is a common answer to this question, as beaches are known for their sunny weather and sandy shores, making them ideal for sunbathing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question specifically asks about the east coast of North America and seafood restaurants, which are commonly found in coastal areas. Maine, Boston, beach towns, and coastal cities all fit this description and are likely places to find seafood restaurants. The option "ocean" is not a feasible choice because it is not a specific location, but rather a general body of water.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a political leader, and the only option that aligns with that description is "government." The other options do not have any connection to being a political leader. Walmart and corporation are businesses, the white house is a building where the president lives and works, and the country is a geographic location, not an institution.
Sitting too close to a screen can cause eye strain and lead to headaches. This is because watching something up close forces the eye to work harder to focus, causing fatigue and discomfort. The other options do not have any connection to sitting too close to a screen.
The sentence suggests that a bald eagle needs a specific location in order to be safe. Bald eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, so it makes sense that they would be safest in a designated wildlife refuge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the game was advertised as free, but the child's parents ended up having to do something related to microtransactions, which usually involve paying money within the game. The word "paying" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to microtransactions. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "accidents" implies that something unexpected and unwanted has happened, potentially resulting in harm or damage. The other options - stressful, fun, illegal, and deadly - do not necessarily imply that accidents are involved. However, "dangerous" is directly related to accidents as dangerous driving behaviors, such as speeding or distracted driving, are often cited as common causes of accidents.
The question suggests that eating too much dinner has negative consequences. The options "living longer" and "illness" are not likely, as they are contradictory or too broad. "Tiredness" may be a result of overeating, but it is not specific to dinner. "Acid reflux" may also be a consequence of overeating, but it is not always associated with dinner specifically. "Stomach ache" is the most likely option as it is a common consequence of overeating at dinner.
When someone is chatting with friends, they are likely looking to connect with others and build relationships. Social bonding is a key reason for people to engage in conversations with friends. The other options may also be relevant in certain situations, but social bonding is the most common and likely motivation for chatting with friends.
The sentence suggests that James was walking on a surface that was made hot by the sunshine. This is a common occurrence on streets or pavement, especially during the summer months when the sun is at its strongest. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the fox was searching for water during a drought, which is a condition commonly associated with California. California has experienced several severe droughts in recent years, so it is likely that this is where the fox was searching for water. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that skiing can have a positive impact on the body, which is why a season of successful skiing may result in a healthy body. Skiing is a physical activity that can strengthen muscles and improve cardiovascular health, which may contribute to overall wellness. The other options imply negative outcomes, such as injury or discomfort, which are not necessarily associated with successful skiing.
The context of the sentence suggests that the sensor is used to measure distance and trigger an alarm when something comes too close. "Proximity" is a term that specifically refers to the state of being near or close to something, making it the most fitting option for describing this type of sensor. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the man looked at his watch while eating lunch suggests that he has somewhere to be, such as at work. The option "late for work" is the most logical answer in this context, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person showed how to do the work in a practical way, using their hands. This is commonly referred to as a hands-on demonstration. A demonstration often involves showing how to do something, rather than just telling or explaining it. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve teaching or showing how to do something.
Jumping jacks are a common exercise in military training, so it is likely that people would be doing jumping jacks on a military base. The other options (opera, water fountain, bus stop, church) do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to see people doing jumping jacks.
The sentence suggests that the bodyguard was successful in his role, which is to protect the person who hired him. Feeling safe is the primary purpose of a bodyguard, as they are hired to provide protection and security. The other options do not align with the purpose of a bodyguard or the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that making mistakes while learning a language can be uncomfortable, which will cause something negative. The word "misinterpretation" implies that the mistakes may lead to misunderstandings, which can be frustrating. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jim committed a crime that was serious enough to catch the attention of the police, which might lead to him being arrested and charged for his actions. Given the severity of his crime, it is likely that he would either be sentenced to jail or prison. Beating him up or killing him would not be a lawful response from the police. Get arrested is not a viable option, as Jim has already been arrested.
The word "fiddle" is often associated with traditional folk music and is frequently played at social gatherings like dances. Therefore, the most likely answer would be a dance hall. While a fiddle may be found in a music store or used in an orchestra or symphony, the context of the question implies a more informal setting. The mention of Tennessee may be a red herring, as it could be a state known for country and folk music, but the other options are a better fit given the context of the question.
The question is about recovering from exhaustion, which is typically caused by physical or mental fatigue. The most common and effective way to address this is by getting adequate rest, which usually involves sleeping. While meditating can help with relaxation and stress reduction, it may not be sufficient to fully recover from exhaustion. Staying in bed without sleeping may not provide the necessary restorative benefits to fully recover, and running out of steam refers to reaching a point of complete exhaustion and collapse rather than a method of recovering from it.
The sentence is asking for a realistic and practical action to earn money, which is often done through employment. Applying for a job is a logical step towards acquiring a steady source of income. Standing in line, taking care of proposals, and passing courses may or may not lead to job opportunities, but they are not direct or guaranteed paths to earning money. Playing the lottery is a form of gambling that is not a reliable or sustainable way of earning money.
The word "grumpy" implies someone who is easily irritated or in a bad mood. Headaches are a common physical symptom associated with stress and tension, which someone who is grumpy may experience. The other options do not have the same clear association with being in a bad mood.
While all of the choices may be potential effects of drug use, "damage" is the most general and inclusive answer. Drugs can cause harm to the body, brain, and overall health. "Cloud mind" and "lower I.Q." suggest more specific and immediate effects, while "cause illness" and "cause accidents" are potential consequences but not necessarily guaranteed. Therefore, "damage" is the safest and most accurate answer.
Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water like rivers and ponds to create a habitat for themselves. However, their dam-building activities can also cause problems for human-made structures, particularly those that rely on water flow, such as a millpond. The other answer options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not likely to be affected by beaver activity.
The phrase "hash things out" implies that they were trying to resolve a conflict or come to a decision. "After enough booze" suggests that they were drinking to loosen up or relax, which may have helped them to overcome any initial tension or disagreements. "Get close on a few things" indicates that they were making progress towards finding common ground. The other options are clearly negative or unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Most fungi thrive in environments that are warm, moist, and often dark. Sunlight can be harmful to fungi, as it can dry them out and cause them to die. Therefore, it makes sense that a fungus would not want to grow in an area where it is constantly exposed to sunlight. Under rocks provides a naturally shaded and damp environment where a fungus could grow undisturbed. The other options do not provide a suitable environment for fungi to grow.
The question is asking for a reason to attend school, which implies that the purpose of school is to gain knowledge or education. "Get smart" is the only answer choice that directly relates to this purpose. The other options ("boredom", "colds and flu", "taking tests", "spend time") do not provide a valid reason for attending school.
The question specifies that the state is south of Kentucky and north of Alabama, which narrows down the options to only Tennessee. The mention of people playing the fiddle suggests a musical tradition, which is commonly associated with Tennessee and its famous country music scene. The other options are not states, nor do they have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there are "figurative scars" that were caused by "making the cut," implying that the subject went through some sort of emotional or psychological trauma. Since the options refer to physical actions (such as stitching or pasting), the most appropriate answer is "heal." This makes sense because emotional or psychological scars don't physically "heal" in the same way that a cut or wound might.
The word "often" implies that the answer is something that commonly occurs when people engage in sex. Studies have shown that sex releases endorphins, which are feel-good hormones. This suggests that feeling good is a common result of sex. The other options are not necessarily always associated with sex. "Making love" is a euphemism for sex and does not describe a consequence. "Happiness" and "wonderful thing" are subjective and not supported by empirical evidence. "Cloud judgment" is not a common consequence of sex.
The sentence implies that there are people in uniform playing with a ball, which suggests that it is a sports-related activity. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hole, television, and pool table do not involve people in uniform or playing with a ball, while a sporting goods store is not a place where people typically play sports. Therefore, the correct answer is "sporting event."
The question is asking for the kind of place that could have a seafood restaurant. Seafood is typically associated with areas that have access to fresh seafood from the ocean, such as coastal cities. While New York City and Boston are both coastal cities, simply saying "city" is too broad and does not provide enough information to make an accurate guess.
The phrase "head of the branch yelling at" suggests that the person in charge is scolding someone under their authority. The word "subordinate" specifically refers to someone who is a lower-ranking member of an organization or company, which makes it the best choice among the given options. The other options, such as "owner" or "foot," do not fit the context of someone in a position of authority yelling at someone else.
The sentence suggests that the person is making continuous calls throughout the day with the hope that people will respond positively to his offer. "Respond" is a suitable choice because it indicates a reaction to what the person is offering. The other choices are not applicable to the context of the sentence - "hang up" suggests a negative reaction, "contact" suggests initiating communication rather than responding to it, "answer" suggests a positive reaction but not necessarily to an offer, and "attracting ducks" is irrelevant.
The sentence suggests that the person is already out shopping for fashion, which implies they are in a commercial area. A mall typically has multiple store options, including fashion retailers and bookshops, making it the most likely location for the person to find what they are looking for. The other options are less likely to have a bookshop within close proximity to fashion stores.
The question suggests that the medium for the advertisement is through a channel that one can access while reading news. The options television, bus, email and la ville are not directly related to reading news, whereas a web page is a common platform for news outlets to display advertisements.
The sentence implies that being good at playing tennis requires a certain level of ability or talent, which is commonly referred to as skill. While having a tennis racket, competing, playing on a tennis court, and having strong legs may all contribute to being a good tennis player, they are not the fundamental requirement like having skill.
The name "John Davis Lodge" suggests that this is a specific road with a designated name. A quick Google search reveals that the John Davis Lodge Memorial Toll Road is actually located in Connecticut. The other options do not have any connection to this specific toll road.
The sentence mentions that the man went to clown college, which strongly suggests that he has an interest in the world of circus performance. Running away with the circus is a common dream for many people who are drawn to the excitement and spectacle of the big top. The other options (carnival, surprise, spoons, party) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jamie's efforts to reduce her waist size were unsuccessful, which implies that her waist size may have increased or stayed the same. The words "augment," "dispare," "make larger," and "expand" all imply an increase in size, while "gain weight" specifically applies to the context of trying to reduce one's waist size.
The sentence suggests that James is experiencing a loss of consciousness, which is commonly associated with a coma. The other options do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. Death and loss of life would imply that James has already passed away, while peace and forgetfulness do not correspond with the fear and fright that James is expressing.
The words "aloof" and "self-important" both suggest that the person is distant and uninterested in social interaction. If someone is aloof, they are not friendly or sociable. If someone is self-important, they have an inflated sense of their own importance and may not be interested in others. Therefore, it is likely that they would feel bored when meeting people, rather than feeling stressed, nervous, or making new friends. Smiling is also unlikely, as their demeanor suggests they do not have a desire to engage with others.
The sentence implies that the person was injured while working on a location where buildings are being constructed. A construction site is an area where workers are engaged in building or repairing buildings or other structures, making it the most likely choice. The other options (factory, engine, shops) do not have the same association with building or constructing, while the option "insides of skyscraper's walls" is too specific and unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the time spent on communicating with each other impacted their ability to move forward with their project, suggesting a slowdown or hindrance in progress. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that playing with your dog will result in a certain outcome. The most logical option is "fun" because playing with your dog is typically an enjoyable and entertaining experience. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Alive" and "health" are not outcomes that would be expected from playing with a dog, and "playing dead" and "black" do not relate to the idea of playing with a dog at all.
The sentence implies that the book is currently being read, which suggests that the most likely location for it to be kept is somewhere where the reader is comfortable and relaxed, such as in bed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a closet or a library of congress would not be practical places to keep a book while it is being read, and a classroom or desk would suggest that the reader is in a more formal or academic setting.
The sentence states that the student needed to get some new pencils, which suggests that the student did not have any pencils on hand. The options classroom, backpack, and cabinet all refer to places where the student could potentially keep pencils, but none of them suggest that new pencils could be obtained from those locations. The option teacher also does not make sense, as the sentence does not indicate that the student would ask the teacher for new pencils. The best answer is store, as this is a common place to purchase new supplies such as pencils.
The sentence suggests that the woman has a strong motivation to shop beyond practical needs like necessities or budget constraints. The word "driven" implies an internal force or impulse that is guiding her behavior, which aligns with the concept of desire. The other options - money, time, credit, and spending money - do not fit as well because they are external factors that may influence shopping behavior but do not necessarily explain a strong drive to shop beyond practicality.
The question asks about a feeling associated with getting paid. Based on common experiences, getting paid is usually a positive experience that can bring satisfaction and relief. The other options, such as income tax and bill collectors, are typically negative aspects of financial transactions. The options "ocean" and "to happy" do not fit the context of the question. The option "sorrow" is unlikely to be associated with getting paid.
The sentence suggests that the fat man was not able to do simple activities, and therefore he refused to accept what was possible. The word "unable" fits this context and meaning. The other options either do not fit grammatically or do not make sense in the given context.
The question is asking where meat can last a long time, suggesting that the correct answer should be a place where meat can be stored for an extended period without going bad. The options "bakery" and "ham sandwich" are not places to store meat, so they can be eliminated. The option "butcher shop" may keep meat fresh for a short amount of time, but it is not a long-term storage solution. The options "fridge" and "freezer" are both places where meat can be stored, but the correct answer is likely "freezer" as it can preserve meat for a longer period of time than a fridge.
A cello is a common instrument found in a symphony orchestra, which is a group of musicians who play instrumental music together. A band typically refers to a group of musicians who play popular music, and while a cello could be included in a band, it is less common. The options "ocean", "music store", and "music shop" have no clear connection to the context of the question.
The choice of words "congregate" suggests that a group of bees is gathering in a specific location to collect nectar from red flowers. While bees are attracted to flowers in general, the color red is particularly appealing to them. A trash can or honey do not seem like likely places for bees to congregate with red flowers, while a bouquet of flowers could contain red flowers but not necessarily attract bees. A rose garden could potentially have red flowers, but it is not specified whether or not bees are present. A field of flowers, however, is a likely place for bees to gather and pollinate.
The question suggests that someone who gets angry after getting drunk is likely to engage in a specific behavior. While it is possible that they may experience other negative consequences like falling down or vomiting, anger specifically implies aggression or violence. Additionally, research has shown a link between alcohol use and increased aggression. The other options do not necessarily relate to anger specifically.
The sentence suggests that the teacher emphasized the importance of listening in order for students to acquire something valuable. Knowledge is a more logical answer because listening is crucial in gaining understanding and learning new information. Empathy may be gained through listening, but it is not specifically mentioned in the sentence. Anxiety and falling down do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "hear things" is too broad and does not provide any specific information.
The sentence suggests that Stanley had trouble distinguishing his dream from something else, which is commonly associated with confusing dreams with reality. The option "reality" is the most logical choice because if Stanley is having trouble telling his dream from reality, then it means that his dream was so vivid and realistic that it felt like it was actually happening. The other options either do not fit the context or do not make sense in the given sentence.
The sentence implies that the community garden was destroyed to make way for a new development or construction. Given that the other options (wasteland, ocean, desert, and flowers) do not logically fit with the idea of a community garden being demolished, the correct choice must be parking lot. This is a common reason for the destruction of public green spaces in urban areas, as developers often prioritize parking availability over community gardens or parks.
The sentence suggests that cats are doing something destructive and potentially damaging, so the correct answer would be something negative, like trouble. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence as well, as there's no indication of a dog or a garage, and "nature" is too broad and doesn't suggest any specific behavior. "Floor" is also too neutral and doesn't suggest any kind of trouble or destruction.
Losing weight can have many positive effects on the body and mind, including increased energy levels. When a person loses weight, they tend to have less strain on their joints and organs, which can lead to increased energy throughout the day. The other options are either negative (such as death) or not necessarily related to the benefits of losing weight (such as loose skin or beauty).
The word "lived" suggests that the person resided in a place, which is typically a building. The other options do not make sense in this context - a demonstration and conference are events, a garage is a type of structure not typically meant for human habitation, and living in someone's mouth is not possible.
The context of the sentence suggests that the skin was cut while the person was chopping onions. The most likely place for a skin to be cut in this situation is on the finger, as this is the body part most commonly used when chopping food with a knife. The other options do not make sense in this context - "good health" and "own family" are not relevant to the situation, while "meat" and "body" do not fit with the sentence's use of the word "skin".
The sentence suggests that the person who has been doing housework for hours may experience a negative emotional state as a result. Both boredom and anger are mentioned as being not what they might feel, which leaves stress and anxiety as possible options. Since housework is often viewed as a chore and can be physically demanding, it is reasonable to expect that it might cause stress, which is a common response to demanding or challenging situations. Anxiety, on the other hand, is less likely to be the correct answer since it is not directly mentioned in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the accountant used a calculator as part of their work, which is typically done in an office setting. The fact that the accountant kept one at home suggests that they might also do work from home or sometimes need to do calculations outside of the office. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not typically associated with work in accounting.
The question is asking about something that typically happens at the end of a meal, which suggests that the correct answer is related to paying for the meal rather than serving, eating, or setting the table. The phrase "present bill" specifically refers to the action of bringing the receipt to the customer to indicate the total cost of the meal, which is a common practice in restaurants.
The question is asking for a word that describes a state of being that is not glad, unhappy, or gloomy. Out of the choices given, only depressed fits that description. Depressed is often used to describe a state of low mood, lack of motivation, and general feeling of sadness. The other options all describe negative emotions that are similar to unhappiness or gloominess.
The sentence suggests that in order to hear testimony about how spirituality changes lives, one must pay attention. The other options, such as going to church or appearing in court, do not necessarily guarantee that one will hear such testimony. Watching soap operas is unrelated to the topic of spirituality.
The sentence suggests that the person had a good sleep or rest, and woke up feeling a certain way. "Wakefulness" appears to be the best choice, as it indicates feeling alert and refreshed after resting. "Active" is a possibility but is not as definitive, as it could refer to feeling energetic or motivated to do things rather than simply feeling awake. "Hunger" and "in motion" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, and "lay down" is obviously not a feeling.
The sentence suggests that there is a famous temple located in a particular region. Based on the choices, the option most closely associated with a temple is Jerusalem, a city known for its religious significance and for being the site of several ancient temples, including the Temple Mount. The other choices (Jewish community, middle east, city, mosque) do not specifically reference a famous temple.
Bees are known to gather pollen from flowers in order to make honey. The only option that mentions flowers is "field of flowers," which is the most likely place for a bee to gather pollen. The other options do not have any clear connection to bees or their behavior.
The sentence suggests that the folding chair needs to be stored in a place where it won't be in the way or take up too much space. Since there are no large doors in the house, it is unlikely that the chair would be stored outside or in a garage. The most logical place to store the chair would be in a closet, which is a space that is designed specifically for storage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the conversation is about getting a divorce, which is a legal process that involves ending a marriage. The other choices do not have any relevance to a discussion with a lawyer about divorce. "Sisters" refers to a familial relationship, while "two people" is too vague and could refer to any type of relationship. "Marriage" and "lawyer" are relevant to the context, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question.
Geese are known for their ability to fly long distances during migration. They are also capable of flying at high altitudes and speeds, which makes flying the most likely method of transportation referenced in the question. The other options do not make sense in the context of geese traveling from place to place.
The sentence suggests that John's hands were injured as a result of punching the wall, which will make it difficult for him to hold his tools. The other options (hostility, anger, nose, fists) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the small dog was limited in its physical space but still felt as though it had a lot of space. This is a common description of how dogs feel when they are in a small, enclosed space like a basket or a crate. The other options do not convey the same sense of being enclosed or restricted in space.
Depression is a mental health condition that can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation may cause someone to feel overwhelmed, hopeless, or trapped, and they may consider ending their life as a way out of their pain. Overdosing, murder, and cyanide do not have a direct connection to depression, while sadness is a symptom of depression rather than a cause of death.
The sentence suggests that the person was unable to attend an event because they were sick and staying in bed. "Missing out" is the most appropriate choice since it implies that the person was unable to experience or enjoy the event due to their illness. The other choices may be relevant or important in other contexts, but do not fit the context of the sentence.
Lizards are often found in arid environments, such as deserts, where they can easily blend into their surroundings and surprise passersby. The other options may also have lizards, but the word "surprise" suggests that there is something unexpected about the location, which is more likely to be the case in a desert than in a forest or garden.
The sentence suggests that a group of people are gathering together to watch a sports game, and the person in question is making sure to bring plenty of food with them. The options "picnic" and "fairgrounds" do not seem like appropriate locations for watching a game, and "space shuttle" is completely unrelated. "Table" could be a possible location, but the fact that the person is bringing food with them implies that they are going to someone else's house. Therefore, "friend's house" is the most likely correct answer.
The phrase "caring heart" is often associated with empathy and compassion, which are traits commonly attributed to mammals. Mammals are animals that nurse their young and have a complex social structure that requires emotional connections between individuals. Therefore, it is likely that "all mammals" would be the correct choice in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to empathy or caring behavior.
The keywords "alcohol" and "fried foods" suggest that the speaker is looking for a place to eat and drink with a casual atmosphere, which is commonly associated with pubs. Pubs often serve a range of alcoholic beverages such as beer and also offer fried foods like fish and chips or chicken wings. The other options such as plane, store, and fraternity house do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the jar is likely to spoil if left out, which indicates that it requires a cool environment to maintain its freshness. The pantry and kitchen cupboard are typically warm and not suitable for preserving perishable items. The grocery store is not a proper storage option for an individual's jar. The refrigerator is the only option that provides the necessary cool environment to keep the jar from spoiling.
The sentence explicitly states that Sam went to Paris, which is in France. The fact that he ordered a blowfish at a sushi place further contextualizes the location as France, as sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that is commonly served in French restaurants. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When skin is pinched in something, it will generally feel pressure due to the compression of the skin and underlying tissues. This pressure can cause discomfort or pain depending on the severity of the pinch. Feeling cold or clammy may be a result of external factors such as temperature or humidity, while feeling bumpy or itchy are unlikely sensations to arise from pinching alone.
The sentence suggests that Sally lost her kite because the string ran out or reached the end of the line. This would explain why it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the end of the line. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the man is preparing for a job interview, which typically requires a professional appearance. Grooming is an essential part of looking presentable and sending the right message to a potential employer. The other options, such as beauty and handsomeness, may not be as relevant or appropriate for a job interview setting. Tardiness is actually the opposite of what the man is trying to achieve by grooming, as it implies being late and disorganized.
The context of the sentence suggests that the scenario is related to a religious activity where people sit and listen to a speech. Synagogue is a place of worship for Jewish people, while confession is a confidential conversation between a person and a priest in Christianity. Both of them do not involve an audience sitting to listen to a religious speech. An office or an auditorium may have people sitting in chairs, but it is not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is church.
Tabby cats are domesticated pets and are most commonly found in people's homes as companion animals. They are known to be affectionate and enjoy human interaction, making the home the most likely place for them to be happy. On the other hand, an alley or barn may be too dangerous or stressful for a pet cat, and a box or lap are not permanent homes.
The question specifies that the focus is on the east coast areas of Florida, which narrows down the possible locations. Denmark and California are not on the east coast of the United States, while "map" is not a geographical location. Therefore, the correct answer is the United States, which is where Florida is located on the east coast.
The sentence suggests that in order to work efficiently, a person must have the right tools. This implies that without the right tools, a person may struggle to complete tasks effectively. The other options, such as persistence or becoming knowledgeable, may be helpful traits or activities, but they do not directly relate to the need for tools to work efficiently.
The question is asking for a specific type of platform found in the ocean, which rules out options like launch pad, circus, and space station, which are not typically found in the ocean. The option of "large open area" is too broad, and could describe any number of things found in the ocean. The correct answer is aircraft carrier, which is a type of ship designed to launch and recover military aircraft.
The sentence suggests that the speaker expected to find potatoes in a container or bag, but instead found a snake. The only option that fits this description is "burlap sack," which is commonly used to store and transport potatoes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that listening to music can have multiple positive effects on a person's emotional state. Research has shown that listening to music can increase dopamine levels in the brain, which can lead to feelings of happiness and pleasure. Music can also trigger the release of oxytocin, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress. Furthermore, music can stimulate the facial muscles, leading to smiles and positive facial expressions. Finally, music is often used as a form of entertainment, which can provide a sense of enjoyment and distraction from daily stressors.
The phrase "make a big splash in a river with a rock" suggests that the goal is to create a significant impact in the water. A bridge is a good option for throwing a rock because it provides a height advantage, allowing you to throw the rock from a higher position and generate more force upon impact. The other options, such as mountains, countryside, or the surface of the earth, do not offer the necessary height advantage to create a big splash in a river.
Perjury is the act of lying under oath or giving false information in a court of law. This is a serious criminal offense and can result in sentencing to prison or jail time. The other options may also apply, but do not directly address the legal consequences of committing perjury in a court of law.
The sentence indicates that the new play was highly popular and well-received by the crowds, which is commonly expressed through applause. Applause is a sign of approval and appreciation for a performance, and is often used to indicate a successful and entertaining show. None of the other options are commonly associated with a successful performance, and do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence includes numerical information and asks for the solution to a mathematical equation, indicating that this is a math problem. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to involve numbers or equations.
Supermarkets are common places where people go to shop and buy food. They are often large stores that stock a wide variety of food items, making it a likely place for people to find food. The other options, such as opera, conference, building, and apartment, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely choices for the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the kid is doing something with a friend before going to play, which implies that they are making plans or coordinating their activity. Out of the choices given, only "meet" fits this context. "Laugh" and "being entertained" suggest that they are already playing or hanging out, while "math" has no clear relevance to the situation. "Sit" could be a possibility, but it doesn't capture the idea of actively preparing to go out and have fun.
The question is asking for a term that describes someone who has obtained a good education. "Illiterate" means the opposite of being educated and would not be the correct choice. "Own house," "have enough food," and "meet expectations" are irrelevant to the question and do not relate to educational attainment. Therefore, "knowledgable" is the appropriate choice as it directly relates to one's level of education.
The sentence suggests that Ben's mistake was significant enough to require him to spend 8 years somewhere as punishment. Given that he was described as an alcoholic, it's likely that his mistake involved drinking and driving, which is a serious offense that can result in a lengthy prison sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not seem like appropriate places for someone who committed a serious crime.
A ticket booth for games is commonly found at an amusement park. Train stations, cathedrals, metro stations, and fairgrounds do not typically have such booths as they are not necessarily associated with games or entertainment.
The sentence suggests that the soccer field is not located inside a building, which would rule out options such as playground, mexico, and town, which do not specify the location of the field. The option world cup refers to a specific tournament, rather than a location. Therefore, the correct answer is outside, indicating that the field is located in an open-air setting.
The sentence implies that the method of delivery being described involves physically bringing letters to their intended recipients. Therefore, options such as "mail box" and "post office" are not correct, as these refer to places where letters are dropped off or picked up, rather than delivered directly to the recipient. "Suitcase" and "bowl" are also unlikely options, as they are not commonly used for delivering letters. "Front door" is a logical choice, as it is where most deliveries, including letters, are typically made.
The sentence suggests that Sam does not like having others around him and prefers to be alone. The most fitting choice would be solitude, which refers to being alone in a calm and peaceful manner. The other options, such as abbreviation and you, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. Loneliness is related to being alone, but it has a negative connotation, which does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in question likes cool temperatures, and may therefore use electric fans to keep their environment cool. The most likely places for them to have more than one fan would be at home or in a hot room. The hardware store and office options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as they do not suggest a personal preference for cool temperatures.
The sentence suggests that the person who is skydiving is becoming unconscious. This could be due to fear or some other reason. The options "injury" and "death" are unlikely because the person is still falling through the air, and there is no evidence of physical harm. "Playing uno" is unrelated and a non sequitur. "Falling down" is incorrect because the person is already falling, and this option does not explain how the person could become unconscious. "Coma" is the best option because it suggests that the person may have some medical or psychological issue that is causing them to become unconscious while skydiving.
The context suggests that the question is asking for a general term for seeing something through an eyepiece, which can apply to a range of devices such as cameras, binoculars, and telescopes. The other choices are more specific and do not necessarily apply to all instances of seeing something through an eyepiece. "Sights" is the most general option that fits the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the decorations are meant to be scary, and that the person responsible for them did a good job. The word "horrible" has a negative connotation and can be used to describe something that is frightening or awful, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions performing well on a test, which is usually a graded assignment in a school setting. The term "school grade" is commonly used to refer to the letter grade that a student receives on an assignment or for their overall performance in a class. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to test performance or grading.
The sentence suggests that if you tell your boss that you are bored, they will tell you to do something which implies that they want you to be productive. The option "work" fits this context the best because it is the opposite of being bored and is associated with being productive in a job environment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Jogging is a physical exercise that has numerous health benefits, such as improving cardiovascular fitness, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting weight loss. Insect repellent is not a result of jogging, while heart attacks and shin splints are negative effects that can occur if one does not exercise safely or appropriately. Being tired is a common feeling after exercising, but it is not necessarily a desirable result. Therefore, improved health is the correct answer.
Nailing is a common method of attaching something to a piece of wood by driving a nail through the material being attached and into the wood. This is a common woodworking technique that is used for furniture, construction, and many other applications. Carving involves removing material from the wood to create a specific shape or design, polishing involves making the wood smooth and shiny, petrification involves turning the wood into stone, and eating cake has nothing to do with woodworking. Therefore, nailed is the correct answer.
Foxes are often found in areas with vegetation and cover, such as grassy fields or forests. Tennessee and England are specific locations and do not provide any contextual clues about where a fox is likely to be caught. An inside joke is not a location at all.
The phrase "new dining table" suggests that the question is asking about a piece of furniture typically used for eating meals. The word "formal" in front of "dining room" implies that the space in question is specifically designated for formal events, such as dinner parties or holiday gatherings, which makes it the most appropriate location for a new dining table. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that fighting inflation might not be necessary or effective because it is not significant. The phrase "so negligible" indicates that inflation is not noticeable or important in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the idea of inflation being insignificant or not noticeable.
The question asks about something that is likely to have more than one level in a city, which suggests that the answer is related to the construction of buildings. A carpenter's shop, garage, and video game are all unlikely to have multiple floors, while the total number is not a thing that can have levels. Therefore, building is the most logical option as buildings commonly have multiple levels, particularly in urban areas where space is limited.
Hospitals are places that prioritize safety and have strict regulations regarding the prevention and management of emergencies. Given the high risks associated with hospitals, they are required to have fire extinguishers in many locations throughout the facility to ensure that the staff can respond to fires quickly and effectively. The other options do not have the same level of potential risk or regulations that would require many fire extinguishers.
The question suggests that the focus is on how someone can learn to play an upright piano. Learning to play piano often involves guided instruction which can be obtained through a music class although the other options may also provide access to an upright piano. A music room or house may have an upright piano but may not necessarily provide instruction. A music store may sell upright pianos but not necessarily offer lessons. "Medium" does not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking about what is necessary for someone to learn by themselves. Of the choices given, exposure, study, and thought may all be helpful in the learning process, but cooperation suggests that the person is not learning alone. Patience, on the other hand, is important because learning by oneself can be a slow process that requires persistence and endurance.
The sentence indicates that John and Jane wanted to be together for a longer time, which suggests that they were considering a long-term commitment. The most common long-term commitment in a romantic relationship is marriage, so it makes sense that they would plan to marry. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the couple's desire for a long-term commitment.
Getting paid usually results in a positive emotion such as happiness because it provides financial security and the ability to afford things that may bring joy, such as entertainment, travel, or hobbies. The other options are not commonly associated with getting paid. Sorrow is unlikely as getting paid is usually seen as a positive thing. Paying bills and frustration are associated with financial responsibility and management, but they do not describe the emotional response to getting paid specifically. Spending money is a consequence of getting paid, but it is not the emotion itself.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is likely going into a market to buy something. The option "food" makes the most sense as the purpose of a market is usually to sell food and other goods. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Stress" and "spending money" may be related to going to a market, but they are not as directly connected as the option "food." "That you" and "walking" are not relevant to the question.
Thin glass is often more fragile than thicker glass and therefore more likely to break easily. Its thinness makes it more vulnerable to pressure and impact, increasing the likelihood of cracks or breaks. The other options do not describe the characteristic of thin glass.
The sentence suggests that there is a consequence for not moving your car during a required time, and the most common consequence for this is getting a parking ticket. Towed and accidents are possible consequences, but they are not a direct result of not moving the car. Driving and getting tired are not consequences of not moving the car at all.
The sentence provides specific details about Bob running from a corner store to his home, indicating that he ran along a specific path. The option "city block" best describes a specific area of a town or city and would be most likely to refer to the distance that Bob ran. The other options do not accurately describe a specific area or distance. "Bed of nails" and "attractive consistent look" are unrelated to the context of the sentence, and "ground" is too broad to accurately describe a specific path.
The phrase "unpleasing fashion" suggests that the sound of the bassoon is not pleasant to hear in this context. High school bands are often known for being less experienced and polished than professional orchestras and symphonies, which may lead to a less pleasing sound. The other options, such as orchestra and symphony, are typically groups that consist of professional musicians who are skilled in playing their instruments with a pleasing sound. The phrase "baritone woodwind sound" is not specific enough to provide a clear answer, and "play music" is too broad and vague to be a relevant option.
The sentence explicitly states that John is competitive and loved competing. This implies that he enjoyed comparing himself to others and determining who was better than whom. The phrase "divide people into categories" suggests that John liked to categorize people based on their performance in competitions. The options "perform better", "might win", "losses", and "enemies" do not fit the context of the sentence as closely as "winners and losers".
The sentence suggests that the game was on sale, indicating that it was previously more expensive than its current price. The phrase "overpriced" implies that the original price was too high, which is why the game was discounted. The other options do not provide a reason for why the game was on sale or why the speaker decided to buy it at that time.
The sentence suggests that the building is large but poorly constructed, which implies that it may not be sturdy or well-built. The word "massive" suggests that the building has a significant size or weight, which makes "massless" a poor choice. "Dwarf" and "inconsequential" both suggest that the building is small or unimportant, which contradicts the fact that the building is described as "massive." "Good" is not an option because the sentence explicitly states that the building is not constructed well. Therefore, "insubstantial" is the most appropriate option as it implies that the building is not solid or substantial due to poor construction.
While a printer can be used in a variety of settings, the option that best fits the description of being used by thousands of people is a print shop. Print shops are businesses that specialize in printing services and typically handle large volumes of printing tasks for a diverse range of clients. Schools and home offices may have printers, but they likely do not serve thousands of people. A people store is not a commonly used term, and a newspaper office may have a printer, but its use would likely be limited to employees.
The question asks for a factor that could prevent someone from buying Christmas presents, indicating that there is a financial limitation. "Lack of money" is a common barrier to purchasing gifts, especially during holidays when people tend to spend more. The other answer choices do not relate to the concept of financial constraints and therefore are not correct in the context of the question.
The question asks what the hope is of playing sports without competition. "Having fun" is a key phrase that indicates that engaging in sports without competition should be an enjoyable experience. Running, balls touching, winning, and getting tired may all be related to sports, but do not specifically address the enjoyment or lack of competition.
The sentence suggests that the reason for the move was to have a master bedroom, which is a feature commonly found in larger and more spacious homes. However, the use of the phrase "moved out of the city" suggests that they were looking for a suburban home rather than a large or old house, which could be located in various areas. The option "keeping personal objects" is not related to the context of the sentence.
The word "line" is commonly associated with graphs, as they often include lines or curves to represent data trends. The other options do not have a clear connection to adding a line. A bus stop typically already has lines marking where people should stand, and adding another line would not be necessary. A post office would not typically require adding a line unless it was for some specific purpose. Adding a line to grass or a play activity does not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence mentions that Joe bought a ficus, which is typically a type of indoor houseplant. Since the other options do not correspond to indoor areas of a home, it is reasonable to assume that Joe intended to place the ficus in a room within his house. The term "family room" is often used to refer to a casual living space within a home, where people gather to watch television or spend time together. Therefore, it is the most appropriate choice.
The sentence mentions an inkwell, which suggests that there was a writing surface nearby. The most likely piece of furniture to have a writing surface is a desk. The other options do not have any clear connection to writing or ink spills.
The question suggests that the reason people continue talking when they discover something new while chatting with friends is because they are interested in learning more about the topic. This is a common motivation for discussing new information with others, as it allows individuals to deepen their understanding of the subject and gain new insights. The other options, such as agreement, discomfort, and misunderstanding, do not provide a clear explanation for why people would continue talking in this scenario. To fill their time may be a motivation for some people, but it is not specifically related to the context of discovering new information while chatting with friends.
The question asks specifically how learning about science can affect one's views, suggesting that the answer will likely involve a change in perspective or understanding. The option "increased knowledge" is a possible answer, but it does not reflect a specific change in view. "Appreciation of nature" may be a potential outcome of learning about science, but it does not fully capture the range of possible changes in perspective. "Become educated" and "excitement" may indeed result from learning about science, but they do not address the question of how one's views may change. "See things differently" is the best answer because it accurately reflects how learning about science can alter one's outlook or understanding of the world.
The sentence indicates that traveling underwater is risky due to low visibility, which can lead to a specific danger: disorientation. Disorientation can occur when a person loses their sense of direction or becomes confused about where they are. This is particularly dangerous when diving because it can lead to getting lost or running out of air. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
An intersection is where two or more roads meet, and people can stand at different locations depending on their purpose. However, the most common place for pedestrians to stand at an intersection is on the street corner or sidewalk. This is because it offers a safe place to wait for the traffic to clear, and it also provides a view of the traffic flow from all directions. The other options, such as cars or at a red light, are not typical places for pedestrians to stand at an intersection.
The sentence suggests that Janet is aware that she is dying from her injuries and is experiencing symptoms that indicate this. The option "stop breathing" is a common symptom of death, as the body's respiratory system shuts down. The other options may be indicative of other conditions or symptoms, but they do not necessarily indicate that Janet is dying.
The sentence suggests that traffic on an expressway can vary based on certain factors. Since the answer choices are all location-related, it can be assumed that the factor affecting traffic is the proximity to a certain location. The most likely answer is an American city, as expressways are commonly found in urban areas and experience higher levels of traffic as you approach the city center. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the location with the highest number of telephone booths. The options given are gas stations, city, London, train station, and airport. Gas stations are unlikely to have many telephone booths as people tend to use their cell phones for emergencies. London may have a large number of telephone booths, but it is unclear if it has more than other options. Train stations and airports may have telephone booths, but their numbers may be limited. Therefore, the best answer is city, as cities typically have more telephone booths scattered throughout their streets and public areas.
The sentence indicates that John moved away from his family for a job, and even though he needed the job, he was a bit upset about the move. This implies that he would have preferred a job that was closer to his family so he would not have to move away. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Alexa needs to switch from an electric guitar to an acoustic guitar to avoid disturbing her housemate James while he works. To find an acoustic guitar, she would be best served by going to a music shop, which stocks a variety of guitars and other musical instruments for sale. The other options (house, storage, closet) are unlikely to yield any new guitars and the studio may or may not have guitars for sale.
The question is asking what can happen when someone is feeling happy. Out of the given choices, "smiles" is the most appropriate as it is a common physical expression of happiness. The other options could potentially be associated with happiness in some contexts, but they do not directly answer the question as asked. For example, "love" could be a source of happiness for some people, but it does not necessarily cause someone feeling happiness to fall into it.
When someone is leaving, it's common and polite to wave goodbye. This is a non-verbal way of saying farewell and indicating that the interaction is coming to an end. The other options are either inappropriate or not relevant to the situation of someone leaving.
The context of the sentence implies that the chef is working in the evening, which is a common time for people to eat dinner. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the chef is cooking dinner. The other options may be things a chef does in general, but they do not specifically relate to working in the evening.
The question is asking about the emotional reaction a person may have if their money is stolen. Feeling angry is a common response to being robbed, as it is a violation of one's personal space and belongings. The other options do not relate to the context of the question or offer any plausible consequences of having one's money stolen.
The sentence suggests that the people in class were asked to come up with ideas, which requires using their minds in a creative way to generate new and innovative solutions. Brainstorming is a common technique used in group settings to encourage free-flowing ideas without judgment or evaluation. The other options do not relate to the concept of coming up with new ideas or brainstorming.
The sentence suggests that someone who doesn't have immortality will eventually experience death, which is a characteristic commonly associated with mortality. Mortal refers to anything that is subject to death, decay, or destruction, whereas the other options all directly refer to the act or state of dying. Therefore, mortal is the best fit for the sentence as it describes the overarching quality of the subject rather than a specific moment in time.
The sentence implies that the protagonist's mother was unhappy with his report card, and so he knew he would be doing housework as a result. The only answer that suggests a possible solution to this problem is "getting good grades," as this would make the mother happy and potentially alleviate the need for housework. The other options do not offer any clear way to prevent the punishment.
The sentence suggests that the glass being referred to is not extra strong, which implies that it is not as durable or resistant to damage as treated glass. Fragile is a word commonly used to describe objects that are easily broken or damaged, making it the most likely choice. Weak and forceless do not accurately describe the nature of glass, while regular and flimsy do not convey the level of potential harm or susceptibility to damage implied by the word "treated."
The phrase "thrown a rod" is commonly used to describe a serious mechanical failure in a car's engine. This happens when a connecting rod breaks or detaches from the crankshaft, causing significant damage to the engine. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the phrase.
The question asks about a mode of transportation that "most people" use, and "own cars" is the most common form of transportation for the majority of people. The other options are not as commonly used for transportation. A helicopter is a luxury form of transportation and not accessible to most people. Speaking words, believing in God, and dancing together are not modes of transportation but rather abilities, beliefs, and activities.
Families often share last names or are given similar first names within the family. The other options are characteristics that are not necessarily shared by all members of a family.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to collect items to sell at a roadside stand, and that this place does not have any grass. A rest area is a common location along highways where travelers can stop to rest and use facilities, and they often have large areas with pavement or gravel that would not have grass. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - a supermarket would not be a place to collect items to sell at a roadside stand, a state park and a garden are unlikely to have areas with no grass, and the surface of the earth is too broad and vague to be a useful option.
The sentence suggests that the context is about kids finding fish in their backyards, which is more likely to be a pond rather than a boat or ocean. The option "end of line" is also unlikely to be the correct answer because it does not make sense in the context of fish and backyards. The option "ocean" is repeated twice, which shows that it is likely a mistake or a distraction.
White shoes are often associated with formal occasions such as weddings. Tennis shoes are usually designed for athletic activities and not usually white. Closet and left foot are irrelevant and house shoes are often comfortable, casual shoes that are not typically white.
The sentence suggests that James wanted to add a personal touch to the cards he chose, which would be achieved through writing them by hand. The option "handwriting" and "hand written" both suggest the act of physically writing the cards. The options "cursive writing" and "store bought" do not convey the same level of personalization as writing the cards by hand, and "online media" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the weather was checked one more time suggests that the travelers were concerned about its condition. Since they are on their way to paradise, they would want the weather to change quickly if it is unfavorable so that they can enjoy their trip without any interruption. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the purpose or goal of talking to someone. The options "hurt feelings" and "dry mouth" are not commonly associated with the act of speaking to someone, while "intimacy" is too specific and may not always be the goal of a conversation. "Changing behavior" may be a desired outcome, but it is not the main purpose of communication. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "communicating with others," which is the basic function of talking to someone.
A hairpin is a commonly used tool for styling hair, particularly for women's hairstyles. It is typically used by professional hairstylists in places such as hair salons or beauty parlors. The other options, such as "hair of woman" or "woman's hair" are not likely places of work, while a pincushion is a sewing tool and a barber shop typically specializes in men's haircuts.
The context of the question is a football field, which is typically where players compete in the sport. The other options, such as a specific state or university, a college campus, or a yard, do not have a direct connection to the context of a football field.
The phrase "master of their craft" suggests that the person is highly skilled and knowledgeable about a particular skill or trade. The verb "learn" is the most fitting of the options given, as it implies that the person has gained knowledge and skill in their craft over time. The other options, such as "drill" or "committed murder most vile," do not make sense in the context of someone being an expert in their chosen profession.
The sentence implies that watching television without accomplishing anything is a negative consequence. "Wasted time" is a commonly used phrase to describe an unproductive use of time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Getting/get fat" may be a result of watching too much television if it interferes with exercise or healthy eating habits, but it is not directly stated in the sentence. "Typing words" is not related to the activity of watching television. "Falling asleep" may occur while watching television, but it is not a consequence of accomplishing nothing.
The sentence states that the man was in a cabin in the woods and saw a fox through the window. The fox is most likely to have been outside, as it is a wild animal that lives in natural habitats such as forests and meadows. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no mention of a location like Indiana or England, a wall or a picture.
The sentence suggests that the hippy was seeking peace and harmony with all humans, which implies that they had positive emotions and sentiments towards people. "Feelings" is the most appropriate answer choice, as it directly relates to the concept of emotions towards other individuals. The other options ("names", "words", "naval", "bladders") are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not help in choosing the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the engineer was skilled overall, but had difficulty with the details of his calculations. The word "sharp" implies intelligence and competence, but the phrase "when it came to the details" suggests a specific weakness. The word "inaccurate" indicates that the engineer made mistakes in his calculations, which is a common problem when details are overlooked or not given sufficient attention. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "in the middle of the day" suggests that the person is likely to take a break from their activities to eat a meal. The options "cook dinner" and "make bread" are unlikely, as these activities typically take more time and are associated with preparing meals later in the day. "Eating in a restaurant" is a possibility, but the phrase "because of being hungry" suggests that the person is looking for a quick and easy meal, which is more likely to be found at home or in a casual dining setting. "Having lunch" is the most appropriate choice as it fits both the context and the expectation that someone would eat a meal in the middle of the day.
The sentence suggests that John is an academic person who enjoys learning and studying. This is evidenced by his desire to spend more time at the museum in order to learn more about the exhibits. The other options are not consistent with John's character or interests.
The word "embarrassing" implies that the situation is one that would cause discomfort or shame. Telling many people about such a situation is likely to result in the situation becoming more widely known, which is what the word "notoriety" suggests. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the electric motor is used in a household item that is present in almost every house. Among the given choices, the only household item which is commonly present in almost every house and uses an electric motor is an electric refrigerator. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence at all.
Peanut butter comes in a variety of packaging types, but generally, it is either stored in a jar or a plastic container. These options provide a tight seal that can preserve the freshness of the product and protect it from oxidation. Supermarkets are primarily places where peanut butter can be purchased, not stored. A pantry or sandwich are places where peanut butter can be consumed, not stored.
Board games are typically played in a comfortable and familiar setting, and "home" is the most likely location. The other options ("toy store," "school," "toy shop," and "shelf") are unlikely because they are not commonly used for playing board games with family.
The sentence suggests that James needs a garage for a specific purpose, and the other options do not fit the context as well. While it's possible that James spent a lot of money on a bike or tool storage, the fact that he needs a garage implies that he needs space to store something larger or more valuable. Additionally, the mention of "spending a lot of money" suggests that the item in question is likely to be expensive, like a car.
The sentence suggests that the person referred to in the question has a unique ability that differentiates them from other things or beings. Among the choices given, only standing upright can be considered a unique ability that only a person possesses. The other options are either common to many other things (crossing the street) or can be learned by anyone (speaking Spanish or Chinese, furthering education).
The question suggests that the friends were looking for a quiet activity to do together, which makes a movie a likely option. Going to a wedding or a restaurant can be noisy and crowded, while going to a friend's house or an internet cafe may not necessarily be a quiet activity. Therefore, the best answer is likely "movie."
The sentence indicates that the animal is tired, which is commonly associated with the need for rest or sleep. It is unlikely that a tired animal would bite, and keeping alive and needing to eat are basic functions that are unrelated to the animal's state of exhaustion. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely to be "go to sleep" or "lie down" because they are actions that an animal would typically take if it is tired.
The sentence suggests that the context is related to watching four-legged animals complete, which is likely a reference to horse races or dog races. In this case, the most appropriate location to watch this activity is at a race track. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lemurs are native to the island of Madagascar and can also be found on the nearby Comoros Islands. Therefore, it would be unlikely to find a lemur in Russia, a hole, a field or heaven. The only option that makes sense is that a lemur would be found at home, which would be their natural habitat in Madagascar.
The sentence suggests that John needed to go somewhere to obtain more pencils. The options "desk drawer," "cup," and "pencil case" are locations where John may have kept pencils, but it is unlikely he would need to go anywhere to obtain more. "Shelf" is too vague to determine if it is a location for pencils or a possible store. "Office Depot" is a store that sells office supplies, including pencils, so it is the most logical choice for where John went to get more pencils.
The only choice in the list that involves making a piece of wood reflective is polishing. Burning, carving, composting, and nailing all involve altering the wood in ways that would not create a reflective surface. Therefore, the correct answer must be "polished."
The sentence suggests that the people in question are expressing themselves, which indicates that they are conveying some kind of message or emotion through their actions. The fact that they trip and break their leg in front of a crowd suggests that their message or emotion is related to that situation. Suffering and pain could be possible emotions in this scenario, but the phrase "people expressing themselves" doesn't strongly suggest those emotions specifically. Laughter seems unlikely, given that breaking a leg is a serious and painful injury. Embarrassment, on the other hand, makes sense given the social awkwardness and potential humiliation of stumbling and falling in public.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is waiting for their friend at a public location, specifically a fitness center with a squash court. The other options, such as a country club or rich person's house, imply a location that would not be open to the public or would not have a squash court readily available. A pool or park may be public locations, but they do not have a clear connection to squash or waiting for someone at a specific spot.
The phrasing of the question suggests that the answer has to do with edible plants, and "vegetable" is a common category of plants that are grown specifically for food. The other options do not fit this category - "flower" and "flower petals" are not typically eaten, and "animal" and "alive" are not plants at all.
Basketball courts can be found in a variety of locations, including gyms, schools, and outdoor spaces like parks. However, the question specifically asks for a location that is likely to be outdoors. Parks are a common location for outdoor basketball courts, as they provide ample open space for the court and allow for easy public access. The other options do not necessarily indicate an outdoor location.
A balalaika is a musical instrument traditionally used in Russian folk music. It is unlikely that an artist would have any use for it, and it would not be found in a junkyard. While it could be used in singing or in an orchestra, a music store would be the most likely place to buy or rent a balalaika.

The sentence mentions a governor's office, which is typically associated with a state government. Four out of the five choices are states, but the question specifies that the city name is "popular," implying that it is a commonly known city. Mississippi is likely the correct answer as it is a well-known state with a capital city named Jackson that houses the governor's office. The other state options may have cities named Jackson, but they are not typically associated with a prominent governor's office.
A microphone boom is a type of stand used to hold a microphone in place during recording or performance. It is commonly used in a recording studio where an artist or band would record an album. A radio station or TV studio might also use a microphone boom, but they are more likely to use stationary microphones instead. A concert setting could also use a microphone boom, but it wouldn't be used specifically for recording an album, as live performances are usually recorded with multiple stationary microphones. New York is not relevant to the context and does not provide any useful information for answering the question.
The sentence implies that the injury being referred to can have serious and potentially fatal consequences. Cause death is the most extreme and severe outcome of an injury. Bleeding, falling down, becoming infected, and claiming insurance are all possible consequences of an injury, but they are not necessarily the worst outcome.
The sentence suggests that the person has a strong emotional connection to their TV, which implies that they would also have a strong attachment to the tool that allows them to control it - the remote. "Attached" best describes this emotional connection, whereas "nostalgic" and "companionable" don't make sense in this context. "Likely" and "close" are vague and don't offer any insight into the person's feelings towards their remote.
The sentence suggests that the man wanted to take a bus but was unable to because all the seats were taken up by people who were "doing" something. The only option among the choices that fits this context is "sitting down." The other options do not relate to what people may be doing on a bus such as "refusing" or "going outdoors." "Save money" is also not likely to be a reason why all the seats on a bus are full.
The sentence suggests that Bob had undervalued his Pokemon cards, but that he was mistaken. The word "common" implies that Bob believed the cards were not special or unique, but the phrase "but he was wrong about them" implies that they were actually in some way exceptional. The word "rare" means something that is not common or is unusual, which fits with the idea that Bob's cards were more valuable than he had believed. The other options do not strongly suggest that the cards were more valuable than Bob had assumed.
The sentence suggests that the husband's marriage is coming to an end, which is typically associated with feelings of sadness and mourning. The word "even" suggests that the husband's emotions may be complex and not focused solely on his relationship with his wife. The other options, such as happiness and pleasure, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not likely to be appropriate emotional responses to the end of a marriage. Isolation may be a possible secondary emotion, but it is not the primary emotion suggested in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the camper was overwhelmed by the vastness of the night sky, which made him feel small and powerless in comparison. "Insignificant" is a word often used to describe feelings of smallness or lack of importance, whereas the other options do not fit the context as well. "Stellar" could be a possibility, but it is not the best fit given the tone of the sentence.
The question suggests that the location mentioned is close to the USA but is still considered an imported product. The only option that fits this description is Canada, as it shares a border with the USA and is a commonly imported source of apples. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the old man did the crossword puzzle every morning as a routine, suggesting that it was a leisure activity he enjoyed. The phrase "simply just to do" implies that the purpose of the activity was not to achieve a specific goal or outcome, but rather to occupy his time. The option "mentally challenged" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it implies a difficulty or struggle, which is not suggested by the sentence.
The question suggests that someone does not like learning, so changing the learning process is necessary. The answer choices "interesting, fun, joyful" imply that the learning process should be engaging and enjoyable, rather than boring or unpleasant. The option "very important" may not necessarily address the issue of someone not liking learning. The option "free" relates more to cost rather than the actual learning process.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the qualities needed to effectively instruct children in a school setting. Of the choices provided, "patience" stands out as the most relevant quality for this purpose. Teaching children can be a challenging and often frustrating task, so it requires a great deal of patience to ensure that they understand the material and remain engaged in the learning process. The other options, such as "boredom" and "inspiration", do not make sense in the given context.
The sentence suggests that grooming pet's nails can be done without causing a negative impact. The choice "satisfaction" could be inferred from the fact that an owner would feel satisfied or happy after successfully grooming their pet's nails without causing any harm. The other options do not appear to fit the context of the sentence, as training and beauty may not necessarily have a direct connection to the action of grooming nails, late may not make sense in context, and injury would be a negative consequence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the man was cleaning his clothes specifically for a date, which implies that he was looking to make himself more attractive to his date. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "ruined" and "sadness" are negative outcomes that the man would not be actively seeking, and "clean clothes" and "look better" are too general to accurately capture the specific goal indicated by the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the person was searching for airline and hotel prices, which strongly suggests that they were planning a trip or vacation. The option "go on vacation" is the most relevant and logical choice, whereas the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence indicates that the person applied lotion for a specific purpose. Lotion is commonly used to moisturize and hydrate skin, which can make it feel smoother and softer. The other options do not make sense in the context of applying lotion.
The sentence suggests that eating breakfast in bed can have a positive effect on one's emotions. The word "assuming that you don't spill anything" implies that the experience can be enjoyable if done correctly. The options "vomiting" and "mess" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence. "Happiness" and "contentment" have positive connotations, but "pleasure" is a more specific and fitting description for the experience of indulging in breakfast in bed.
The sentence states that an "adult man" is getting ready for work, which implies that the person is male and capable of dressing themselves. Therefore, the correct answer would be "dress himself." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are not appropriate actions for someone getting ready for work.
The sentence suggests that the woman was surrounded by other trees while picking from an apple tree, which would likely indicate a natural, outdoor environment rather than an urban or commercial location like a farmer's market. Illinois, New York, and Indiana are all states that have wooded areas, but the word "woods" specifically refers to a dense forest or wooded area, making it the most appropriate choice.
The dictionary is a book and therefore normally belongs on a shelf. A library or classroom might also have a suitable shelf, but the context of the sentence suggests that Mom is cleaning a personal household rather than a public space. The table and desk are possible options, but they are not as suitable as a shelf for long-term storage and organization of a dictionary.
The sentence suggests that the judge played a significant role in the man's ultimate fate, indicating that this decision was crucial. The context implies that the severity of the sentence was what condemned the man, and the option "death" is the most severe punishment that a judge can impose. The other options, such as "go to jail" or "incarceration," may be significant penalties but do not match the severity implied in the sentence. "Intercourse" and "judgement" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Simon bought the cow for work, not for meat, which suggests that he plans to use it for a purpose other than being sold for slaughter. Taking the cow to a butcher shop would contradict this purpose, as it implies that Simon is interested in obtaining meat from the animal. The countryside or city options do not provide any insight as to where Simon might be taking the cow, as both locations could be home to various types of farms or businesses. Canada, while a possible location, is not hinted at by the context of the sentence. The most likely option is a dairy farm, as cows are commonly used for their milk in such establishments.
The word "bored" suggests that the children are looking for something to do to alleviate their boredom. Playing tag is a common activity for children that is both fun and active, making it a likely choice for children looking to pass the time. Walking and changing shoes are not typically activities that children will choose to do to alleviate boredom, while smelling smoke and reaching over have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Canned goods are typically stored in a pantry, which is a small room or closet used for storing food or household items. A pantry is designated specifically for food storage and is often a separate room or space from the kitchen. The other options may also be used for storing canned goods, but they are not as commonly associated with canned goods as the pantry.
The sentence implies that the speaker is recalling a positive memory to help them feel better while they are in the hospital. The word "massage" suggests a relaxing experience, which would likely bring someone pleasure. The other options, such as depression or nostalgia, do not fit the context of a positive memory.
Since the question is asking about maximizing potential customers, it is logical to choose a location with a larger population to draw from. A big city would have more potential customers than a small town or even a shopping mall. While New York is a big city, the answer does not necessarily have to be that specific and could apply to any big city. The other options, such as Idaho or a shopping mall, would likely limit the number of potential customers.
The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. A ball is typically a toy, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that a toy store would have a wide variety of balls available for purchase. The kitchen, child's hand, and street are unlikely places to find a ball, and while a soccer game is a possible location, it is not necessarily a good place to get a ball if one is not already in possession of one.
The question is asking for a common chemical reaction that is used as a heat source, and fire is the most commonly known example of this. Coal or wood are fuel sources that can be burned to create a fire, but they are not the actual chemical reaction. Lava is a type of molten rock and not a chemical reaction. A house and solar energy are not related to the question at all.
Piggy banks are often used to save money in a way that makes it difficult to access the saved money without breaking the bank itself. Unlike a cash drawer or purse, piggy banks do not have an easy opening or access point, while boxes and pockets are usually not specifically designed for holding money.
In a restaurant, the menu typically lists all the available food and drink options, including milk. Checking the menu would be the easiest way to find out if the restaurant serves milk. The other choices, such as asking the waitress or checking the accompaniment to the meal, may not always provide accurate information. Cafeterias and home are not related to the context of the question.
The given sentence suggests that the thing being described can hold a limited number of people, and that number is around 100. Classrooms are commonly associated with a specific number of students and are designed to accommodate a limited number of people at a time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John joined the army with the intention of traveling and exploring new places, but when the fighting started, he only saw a specific type of scenery. The most likely option is the battlefield, as it is where soldiers typically fight in wars. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not imply that John would have seen them during his service.
The context of the question suggests that the game being referred to is likely a typical childhood game, which is often played indoors in a family environment. The toy store, bar, and casino are unlikely places for children to play games, while the table is too generic to be a specific location for playing games. The family room, on the other hand, is a commonly known location where families gather and play games together.
The sentence indicates that the consequence of driving a car mentioned in the choices will not involve pain. Automobile accidents and car crashes often result in physical pain and injury, while backache and eye strain can cause discomfort and pain. The only option that does not involve pain is getting tired, which is a common experience for drivers who have been on the road for long periods of time.
The sentence suggests that the air in the place mentioned has been breathed by only a few people recently. A cupboard is a small, enclosed space that is usually kept closed, making it unlikely that many people have been breathing the air inside. The train station, house, and cricket stadium are all large spaces with a lot of people passing through, making it more likely that the air has been breathed by many people. The surface of the earth is a vast area where air is constantly being circulated and exchanged, making it unlikely that the air in any one place has been breathed by only a few people recently.
Bankruptcy is a legal process in which an individual or entity is unable to repay their debts. When a company goes bankrupt, it may file for bankruptcy protection or be forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. In most cases, the company's assets are liquidated or sold to pay off its debts. This process is called liquidation. The other choices do not accurately describe the outcome of bankruptcy. "Own resources" and "branch out" suggest that the company may recover on its own, while "commit crime" is not a legal outcome of bankruptcy, and "game over" is too vague to be a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that a sport is being referred to that doesn't allow the use of hands and in which blood isn't usually spilled. Soccer is a sport that meets both of these criteria, as it is played without the use of hands and physical contact that could cause blood to be spilled is generally discouraged. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the dog ran to the front window and barked, which suggests that the presence the dog is reacting to is located at the front of the house. The options "building," "friend's house," and "classroom" are too general and do not provide any contextual clues related to the sentence. The option "window" is already mentioned in the sentence and would not make sense as the answer. Therefore, "front door" is the most logical choice as it is directly related to the context of the sentence.
The image of people lined up next to a sign suggests a location where people gather to take transportation. A bus stop is a common place where people wait in line to catch a bus, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the image of people lined up next to a sign.
The sentence suggests that the person is doing something actively for a reason, and that reason relates to being able to pay bills. The most logical choice from the options is "making money," as this is the most direct way to ensure that bills can be paid. The other options are either too general or not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that John has achieved a prestigious position, which is likely to be related to professional violin playing. First violin is typically a position in a symphony orchestra, where the first violinist leads and coordinates the other violinists in the orchestra. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general or not related to professional violin playing.
The other options - suitcase, filing cabinet, desk drawer - are physical storage solutions and not suitable for digital files. A computer can be used to store digital files, but it is not the only option. The cloud is a popular and secure way to store digital files, making it the correct answer.
The question specifically mentions water and soap, which are commonly used in washing machines to clean clothes. The other options have no clear connection to the use of water and soap.
An apiary is a place where bees are kept, which suggests that the answer should be related to beekeeping or honey production. The options "jar" and "stick to fingers" do not make sense in this context, while "farmer's market" could be a possible answer as they often sell locally sourced products including honey. However, the best answer is "beehive" as that is where honey is produced and harvested directly from the apiary.
An attache case is a type of briefcase that is traditionally used for business purposes. It usually contains important documents or work-related items, which is why it would make the most sense to bring it to a business meeting. The other options do not align with the professional connotations of an attache case. Bringing it to a hospital or in a shirt, for example, would not make much sense contextually. The overhead compartment and chair options are both possible, but less likely since they do not reflect the purpose or context of the attache case.
The sentence mentions "books" and "chapters", indicating that the context is related to reading. The question asks why books have chapters on the back, suggesting that the answer will involve knowledge about the purpose of book chapters. Chapters in a book are typically used to organize the content and make it easier for readers to navigate and find specific information. Therefore, the correct answer is "read book". The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the family is enjoying their time playing cards and experiencing a positive emotion. Happiness is the most likely option as it is the opposite of sadness and anger, and matches the description of the family being "full of joy." Amusement is also a possibility but may not fully capture the intensity of the joy described in the sentence. Losing money and anger are not consistent with the positive tone of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Jimmy cannot drink in his own home because his wife is an alcoholic on probation. Therefore, he may go to his neighbor's house to drink instead. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions both Amsterdam and Fortis bank, which are both associated with the Netherlands. Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, and Fortis bank was a Dutch multinational bank that was based in Amsterdam. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a place where glue bottles are commonly used. The options of police station and classroom are unlikely as glue is not a common material used in those settings. Desk drawer is too specific and not a location where many glue bottles would be stored. School is too broad and does not offer any specificity to the question. This leaves the art room as the most likely answer, as glue is a common material used in art projects.
The sentence suggests that the meeting between the king and the ambassador is a formal and official one, which would likely take place in a grand and ceremonial space. The throne room is a common location for important meetings and events in monarchies, and is often the designated space for welcoming important guests and conducting official business. The other options do not have the same level of significance or formality as the throne room in this context.
The use of the word "concrete" suggests that the ball is meant to be bounced or played with on a hard surface, making the soccer field and soccer game options potential correct answers. However, the use of the word "kids" and the lack of mention of any organized teams or games makes the street option the most likely correct answer. Playing with balls on the street is a common activity for kids, and concrete is a commonly used surface for playing with small balls like bouncy balls or handballs. The other options do not fit with the context of the question.
The words "diving off a cliff" and "cartoon character" suggest a humorous or exaggerated scenario, which would align with the word "comedy." The word "splat" is often used in cartoons to represent a character hitting the ground or a solid surface after a fall, which would make sense given the context. The other options (exhilaration, dismemberment, spinal injuries, and getting wet) do not fit the comedic tone implied by the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Jimmy did not enjoy the atmosphere of the party. The phrase "did nothing but" indicates that the guys at the party were engaged in a repeated or continuous behavior. Of the given choices, "getting drunk" is the most likely behavior to elicit a negative reaction from someone who does not enjoy that kind of activity. The other options, such as dancing or meeting new people, do not necessarily imply negative feelings.
The sentence suggests that a person needs to get something when they have more kids, and larger house is the option that directly relates to this need. When a family expands, they may require more space in their home to accommodate everyone's needs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they all relate to personal growth or relationships rather than practical needs for a growing family.
A ficus is a type of tree commonly found in indoor settings, often used for its decorative foliage. Botanical gardens and arboretums are both places where one might find a special ficus, as they are locations dedicated to the cultivation and display of plants. A doctor's office or public place would be less likely to have a special ficus, and "in a sea" does not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James is concerned about not having all the qualifications that the job requires, which could make him less likely to be accepted or hired. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there may be a sign that someone will not be living soon, and out of the options given, shuddering is the most likely choice. Shuddering can be a symptom of a serious medical condition, such as a stroke or seizure, which could potentially threaten one's life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that riding a bike through rough terrain can be dangerous, indicating that there is a risk of an accident occurring. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "obtuse" typically means confusing or difficult to understand, so the opposite of this would be something that is easy to understand or clear. The other answer choices (pointed, bright, acute angled) do not have a clear connection to the definition of "obtuse" and are therefore unlikely to be correct.
The sentence suggests that some customers prefer to have their purchases delivered straight to their doorstep, which is a service commonly provided through mail orders. Mail orders allow customers to purchase products remotely and have them shipped to their preferred address, which can be more convenient than going to a physical store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Exercise has been widely associated with various health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle strength and endurance, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The other options, such as heart attacks or fatigue, are negative outcomes that are not commonly associated with exercise. Relaxation and rest may be some benefits of exercise, but they are more specific and not as overarching as good health.
The question is asking about the placement of a utensil on one side of a plate, which indicates that it is a part of the table setting. The other options do not make logical sense in this context. A spoon would not typically be placed in a bowl of soup or a serving dish, and it would not be relevant to a placemat or a glass of iced tea.
Sheet music is the most common form of written music notation and is specifically designed to indicate a melody, often including information about rhythm, tempo, and dynamics as well. The other options do not have any clear connection to music notation or indicating a melody.
The question implies that the years of playing tennis have a negative impact on the player's body. Tennis elbow is a common injury that occurs from repetitive wrist and forearm motions, which are common in tennis. The other choices do not fit with the context of the question, as they are either positive outcomes (professional player, victory) or general effects of playing tennis (exercise, becoming tired).
The sentence mentions a roller coaster, which is a common attraction found at amusement parks. Parking lots near roller coasters are likely to be located at amusement parks. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A virus is a type of microorganism that infects living organisms, including humans. The word "primarily" in the question indicates that there may be other actions a virus can do, but the primary one is to infect. Reproduction and mutation are also common actions of viruses, but they are secondary to their ability to infect. The other options are not related to the function of a virus.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place where they can buy a cake instead of making one themselves. The options "theater," "refrigerator," and "oven" do not make sense in this context. A "grocery store" might have the ingredients to make a cake, but it is not necessarily where someone would go to buy a pre-made cake. A "bakery," however, is specifically known for selling baked goods, including cakes, so it is the most appropriate choice.
Synagogues are places of worship in the Jewish religion, and cleanliness is considered a vital component of religious observance. The floors and other surfaces are kept clean to prepare for prayer and other sacred activities. In contrast, restaurants and other buildings may have a less strict standard of cleanliness, and carpets are often not considered the most hygienic surfaces. The basement is also unlikely to be associated with holy purposes in this context.
The sentence implies that there is a war happening and that a bullet projectile is involved. It is likely that the bullet projectile would be found on the battle field, where the fighting is taking place. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to the concept of a queen not always being present. In a bee hive, there may not always be a queen bee present, as she may have died or been replaced by a new queen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of a queen not always being present.
The sentence suggests that learning hard concepts requires a certain quality or characteristic. "Intelligent" is a common trait associated with the ability to learn difficult concepts. The concept of copying is not relevant to the context of the sentence, and the other options may contribute to learning but do not directly answer the question of what is needed to learn hard concepts.
The sentence suggests that exercise is a way for addicts to cope with their addictions, and the correct answer should reflect why exercise is helpful for this purpose. Exercising helps individuals expend energy and release endorphins, which can produce a natural high and reduce cravings for drugs or other addictive substances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence contrasts the sound that a person would hear at sunset (a night owl) with the sound that they would hear at sunrise. The options "morning person," "early bird," "lark," and "early riser" all refer to people who are awake early in the morning, but they do not make a noise that is commonly associated with that time of day. A rooster, however, is known for its crowing at dawn, which makes it the most likely answer.
The other choices are all places or activities that are commonly associated with children's interests or enjoyment. A classroom may be associated with learning and socializing with peers, a toy store offers the opportunity to explore and choose from a wide variety of toys, a soccer game provides the chance to engage in physical activity and competition, and school in general offers a more structured environment for children to learn and grow. In contrast, dinner may be seen as a routine or tedious activity, especially if it involves eating something that the child dislikes.
The question is asking about the preference of rich people in terms of bagels. The word "like" suggests that the answer is a positive attribute, so we can eliminate options like "poor" and "homeless." The word "sleepy" has no clear connection to bagels, so it can also be eliminated. The words "plain" and "needy" might be more likely to describe a bagel, but "needy" is not a positive attribute, so we can eliminate it. This leaves us with "plain" as the most likely answer, as many people enjoy plain bagels and it does not have any negative connotations.
The sentence suggests that the shop will give you something in exchange for your purchases, which is commonly a container to carry the items. This is a common practice in retail, where customers are given shopping bags or other types of containers to hold their purchases. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
A small knight is likely referring to a chess piece, which is used in the game of chess. Therefore, the correct answer would be a place where chess is played or where chess pieces are commonly found, such as a chess board. The other options, such as fairy tales or doll houses, do not have a clear association with chess pieces.
The question is asking about a method of getting in shape when there is no land nearby. Swimming is a good option because it can be done in bodies of water such as pools, lakes, or oceans. Jogging and working out usually require a solid surface to run or exercise on, and rock climbing requires a specific type of terrain. While exercise in general can help with getting in shape, the question specifically mentions a lack of land, making swimming the most viable option.
The question is asking about the consequences of doing a poor job. While the other options may be related to work performance, criticism is specifically related to receiving negative feedback from one's boss in response to poor performance. The other options do not directly address the consequences of doing a poor job.
The cabinets were bought by John and their purpose is not very clearly stated, but it can be inferred that they will be installed in a place where they can be seen and appreciated for their looks. Kitchens are a common area where cabinets are installed for both practical and aesthetic purposes. The other options, such as pantry or containing pots and pans, are related to the kitchen and may be areas where cabinets can be installed, but they do not specifically suggest that the cabinets were bought for their looks. In a flight or in Mexico have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking for a negative consequence that two people competing might experience. Of the choices given, stress, tension, and winning or losing can be consequences of competition, but they don't necessarily involve interaction between the competitors. Debates also involve interaction, but they don't necessarily have negative connotations. Arguments, on the other hand, are typically negative and involve two or more people attempting to prove their point, often leading to heightened emotions and conflict. Therefore, the correct answer is argument.
AI (artificial intelligence) machines are typically programmed to perform a variety of tasks, including answering questions. AI technology is designed to analyze data and provide responses based on that data, making it well-suited for tasks that require processing large amounts of information quickly and accurately. The other options (flying, milking cows, eating, failing to work) do not have any direct connection to AI technology.
The sentence suggests that Bob and Boris were bothered by the loud children in front of them in the queue, which is commonly associated with being annoyed. Frustration and delays can be caused by various factors such as long waiting times or slow service, but there is no indication of this in the sentence. Irritation may be a similar option, but being annoyed captures the specific feeling of being bothered by the noise. Out of order does not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the blowfish lives on its own and is not confined to a specific location. This suggests that the blowfish lives in the wild or the natural environment, which is often referred to as the great outdoors. The other options are not likely habitats for a free-living blowfish.
A paper notice is typically left on a front door as a way to communicate information to the occupants of a house. This could be a notice from a delivery service, a reminder about an upcoming appointment, or a notice about a community event. The other options, such as conference or suitcase, do not make sense in the context of leaving a paper notice.
The sentence suggests that the people being described are intentionally hurting others, which is a trait commonly associated with cruelty. Deception and aggression could also be traits exhibited in such a scenario, but they do not necessarily imply the intention to harm others. Altruism is the opposite of harming others, and stupidity is not a trait commonly associated with intentional harm.
The sentence mentions the child pounding his mitt, which is a common action seen in baseball games. Additionally, the sentence mentions "enjoying his first game in the bleachers," which implies that the child is watching a spectator sport rather than participating in an activity like a laboratory or pharmacy. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Eating uncooked chicken can lead to various illnesses caused by bacteria such as salmonella, which can cause symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The poor man likely felt sick after eating the uncooked chicken. The other options are also possible consequences of eating uncooked chicken, but "illness" is the most general and accurate description of what the poor man experienced.
The sentence suggests that the man's excessive handwashing caused some negative consequence, which is likely to be irritation. Excessive handwashing can lead to dry and irritated skin due to the loss of natural oils and moisture. The option "use soap" is not a consequence but a possible action related to handwashing. "Cleanliness" and "thinking" are unlikely to be negative consequences of obsessive handwashing. "Wet towel" is also not relevant to the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person is on the beach, which is often associated with sunny weather and opportunities for sunbathing. Additionally, the phrase "laying on the beach" suggests a relaxed and leisurely activity, which supports the idea of sunning oneself for enjoyment or relaxation. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence or are unlikely motivations for someone laying on a beach.
The description of the child's playroom as "massive" implies that they are wealthy and live in a large home. The option "big house" is the only choice that fits this description, while the other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "begins and ends with new life" suggests that the sentence is about reproduction and the creation of new life. The word "reproducing" in the sentence also supports this idea. Of the answer choices, "birth" is the only option that directly relates to the creation of new life. The other options are not related to reproduction and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The North Pole is located at the top of the globe, and is known for its extremely cold temperatures and consistent presence of snow and ice. Africa is located near the equator and tends to have warm temperatures year-round, making it unlikely to always have snow. The roof and surface of the earth are not specific locations known for having snow, and Canada is known for its cold winters and snow, but not necessarily always having it year-round in all regions.
The sentence suggests that a person wants to fit in with their friends and have fun. To fit in and have fun, it's important to feel understood by others, which is a common desire among social beings. The other options may contribute to having fun with friends, but they do not necessarily address the underlying desire to fit in and feel understood.
The sentence suggests that the goal is to teach the children teamwork, which is a common objective in sports. Sports require coordination and communication among team members to achieve a common goal, so it makes sense that the parents would sign their children up for sports to help them learn about teamwork. The other options do not necessarily involve teamwork in the same way that sports would.
The sentence suggests that the human is feeling sleepy and needs to be more alert. Drinking coffee is a common solution for feeling more awake and alert, as caffeine is a stimulant that can help counteract drowsiness. The other options, such as dreaming, thinking critically, crossing a road, or driving a car, are not relevant to the context of the sentence and do not provide a solution for feeling more alert.
A city is a large urban area that is densely populated and has a high concentration of businesses and services, including sporting goods stores. In contrast, a town is a smaller urban area that typically has fewer businesses and services, and would be less likely to have hundreds of sporting goods stores. ESPN is a television network that specializes in sports coverage, but does not have any physical stores. Jerseys are a type of athletic equipment, but the question asks for a place, not an item. Therefore, the best answer is city.
The sentence suggests that the little girl had a selfish upbringing, which may have influenced her behavior. The phrase "she didn't even care" implies that she was intentionally doing something that was considered negative or hurtful. "Being mean" is a common behavior associated with selfishness, while the other options (crack, antipathy, disinterest, unfeeling) do not have a clear connection to the context given in the sentence.
The sentence explicitly mentions "exploring space," which immediately eliminates the options of a public place, roadblock, hoverboard, and supermarket. The only logical answer remaining is a space shuttle, as it is a vehicle designed specifically for space travel.
Botanic gardens are known for their collection of various plant species, including rare and exotic ones. Roses, being a popular flower species, can be found in many botanic gardens across the world. Flower gardens may also have a variety of roses, but they may not necessarily have the rarest or most unusual varieties. Backyards and supermarkets typically have a more limited selection of rose varieties, while "outdoors" is too vague to be a reliable answer.
The other options (ocean, universe, attic, chair) are too broad or unrelated to the context of the question. The context suggests that a light is needed for a specific task, and a desk is a common location for a task light.
The sentence implies that there is a specific risk associated with eating a hamburger from someone you do not know, which is not present when you usually eat a hamburger. Food poisoning is a common risk when eating food that has not been prepared properly or stored correctly, especially when eating food from sources that may not have strict food safety standards. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence clearly indicates that the person touched an exposed wire, which can result in an electric shock. Therefore, it would not be surprising for the person to feel shocked when touching the wire. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the physical sensation or action of touching an exposed wire.
The sentence provides information about the geographic location of the person, indicating that they are located in a landlocked, southern state. Of the options provided, South Carolina is the only southern state listed, and the option "hen house" is not a location where a person would typically see a fox. Additionally, the option "at the zoo" implies that the fox is in captivity, which is not specified in the sentence. The options "louisiana" and "arkansas" are both southern states, but the sentence narrows the possible location down to one state, South Carolina.
The phrase "more orthodox behavior" suggests that the priest is advocating for traditional and strict adherence to religious doctrines and practices. The word "heretical" means departing from or denying fundamental religious beliefs or principles, and is the opposite of orthodox. The other choices may not necessarily be opposed to the priest's push for more orthodox behavior, or may be unrelated to religious principles.
The sentence suggests that the person felt a sense of relief and freshness after getting out of the car in the mountains. The phrase "breathing fresh air" indicates that the person may have been in a stuffy or polluted environment before, and is now enjoying the clean air in the mountains. Therefore, it is logical that the person would take deep breaths to fully appreciate the fresh air. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the person's response to the mountain air.
The sentence suggests that the cow prefers to be inside the stable even after the storm had passed, which implies that the stable is the cow's shelter or home. It is commonly known that cows and other farm animals seek shelter during severe weather conditions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Contraceptives are typically obtained at healthcare facilities such as health centers or clinics. Vaginas and medicine cabinets are not places where contraceptives are obtained, and drawers and emergency rooms are not typically associated with contraceptive access.
The Indian Ocean is a body of water on Earth, so the correct answer would be Earth. Mars is a planet and does not contain the Indian Ocean. Asia and the East refer to a geographic region, while the Southern Hemisphere refers to a part of Earth, but none of these answer choices specifically identify the location of the Indian Ocean.
The question is asking where a ficus plant would be suitable for adding brightness to a room. The word "room" suggests that the correct answer will be an indoor location, which rules out the options of middle east and palace. The option of dictionary doesn't make sense since a ficus plant cannot brighten up a book. The option of pots is also not suitable since it refers to a container rather than a location. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is apartment, which is a common location where people might have plants to add aesthetics to their living space.
The sentence suggests that the turkey needs to be stored in a way that prevents it from spoiling. The refrigerator and freezer are both commonly used for this purpose, as they are able to keep food at colder temperatures and slow down the growth of bacteria. The oven is not useful for storing food, as it is typically used for cooking. The option "bought at store" is irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about how to store the turkey.
The word "giant" implies that the hole is large in size, which fits the definition of a gorge. A gorge is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides, often formed by a river or other body of water. The other options do not fit the description of a "giant hole" and are less likely to be found in a plain.
Oxygen is a component of the air we breathe, so if someone needs to keep track of how much oxygen there is, they are likely in an environment where air is present. The other options do not typically contain a significant amount of breathable air, except for possibly the space shuttle, which does have an artificial atmosphere, but still primarily relies on air as a source of oxygen.
The sentence suggests that the man put on his headphones to block out the noise of the other passengers and to relax. The option to "listen to music" makes the most sense, as it is a common way to relax while also shutting out external distractions. The other options do not fit with the context of being on a bus and trying to relax while surrounded by noisy passengers.
The sentence suggests that the person was aware of being pursued by the police and likely preparing to flee or escape. "Prepare to go" is the most logical choice in relation to the context of the sentence. The other options have no clear connection to the situation of being pursued.
Running is often associated with feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction, as it is a physical activity that requires effort and endurance. The other options (flying, sweating, falling down, trip) do not accurately reflect the common feelings and experiences associated with running.
The sentence suggests that the person is fiddling through a music book instead of playing. This implies that they may not have practiced enough to be able to play without looking at the sheet music. Dexterity refers to physical skill, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that this is the issue. Idle time and knowledge of music are not directly related to the problem described in the sentence. A conductor is not relevant to the question as well.
The sentence describes a character who is causing accidents and implies that the character is fragile, suggesting that the character is likely to be easily damaged or destroyed. The character's hope is to find a person who is the opposite of him, suggesting that the person he is looking for is likely to be extremely strong and resistant to damage. The word "indestructible" fits this description well, as it means impossible to destroy or damage. The other options do not fit the context as well, with the exception of "unbreakable," which could also work but is not as strong as "indestructible."
The question is asking where one could obtain a bass clarinet to take home, implying that it would be a rental or purchase. The options of orchestra, school band, and opera house do not typically provide musical instruments for individual use outside of rehearsals or performances. Home is not a realistic option for obtaining a bass clarinet. Therefore, music store is the most likely answer as they specialize in selling and renting musical instruments.
The sentence suggests that in order to make a decision about whether to view artifacts, one needs to undergo some process of knowledge acquisition or understanding. Learning is the only option in the choices that is related to the idea of acquiring knowledge. Painful memories, thinking, awe inspiring, and pleasure are not directly related to the process of making a decision about viewing artifacts.
The sentence indicates that Mary was not comfortable speaking with James because she was not familiar with him. It can be inferred from this that she may come off as shy, as someone who is hesitant to engage with others they do not know. The other options do not necessarily suggest that Mary would appear as shy in this situation.
The sentence suggests that the launch pad was just one component of a larger complex, which is commonly associated with a space center. A space center is a complex where rockets are launched and space exploration operations are conducted, often consisting of various launch pads, communication centers, and support buildings. The other options, such as movie or military installation, do not have any clear connection to the context of launching rockets.
The sentence mentions that items in an electronics store were damaged from the rain, suggesting that they were not properly protected from weather elements. Therefore, it makes sense to store them in a building, where they can be protected from rain and other weather conditions. The other options either do not provide sufficient shelter from the rain or are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man committed suicide, which is often associated with feelings of unhappiness or despair. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why the man chose to end his life. It is possible that he was suffering from mental health issues or other personal struggles, which may have contributed to his decision to commit suicide.
The sentence suggests that being "thick" is not desirable, which implies that the opposite trait would be ideal. The word "slender" is commonly used to describe someone who is thin and has a desirable body shape. The other options, such as "free flowing" and "sparse," do not relate to body type or shape in the same way that "slender" does. "Unacquainted" and "diet" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wore inappropriate footwear while walking all day and that as a result, has developed something on their heels and toes. Blisters are a common consequence of wearing poorly fitting or inadequate shoes for a prolonged period of time. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the action being described would release energy, but not primarily in your muscles. Thinking requires mental energy, which is not primarily generated by muscles. Venting, shouting, working off, and exercising are all physical actions that can release energy from the body's muscles.
Crossword puzzles are often associated with the use of a dictionary to help solve them, as they require knowledge of words and their meanings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of someone looking to alleviate boredom with the aid of a dictionary.
The question suggests that the answer is something that is made out of only one piece, indicating that it is a single unit without any additional components. A jigsaw puzzle has multiple small pieces that are assembled together, a chess game has a board and multiple pieces, and the misspelled options "jigsaw puzzel puxxle" and "puxxle" are not actual objects. The puzzle box, however, is typically made out of one piece of material that is intricately designed to be assembled or opened in a specific way.
The word "mascot" implies that the giraffe was a symbol or representative of a business or organization, and the fact that it was called a cow suggests that the child was not yet familiar with the specific animal. The reference to a "now defunct" entity indicates that the business no longer exists. Out of the given options, a toy store is the most likely candidate for having a mascot, and the fond memory implies that the child enjoyed visiting the store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person was navigating through a large building with different levels and rooms, indicating that they were likely in an office building or a similar complex. The other options, such as a school or a hotel, may have multiple floors as well, but do not have the same connotation of being a labyrinthine structure that can cause confusion and get someone lost.
The sentence lists different ways that corn can be prepared, which suggests that the topic of the sentence is related to food. The phrase "people like to" further indicates that the sentence is discussing a popular activity or preference. The options "expect to die" and "believe in god" are not relevant to the topic of corn or food in general, while "stay in" and "watch movies" do not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, "eat corn" is the most appropriate answer.
The word "conscience" refers to a person's inner sense of what is right and wrong. Committing a murder is a serious violation of societal and moral norms, and it is likely that the perpetrator would experience a powerful sense of guilt and remorse. The other options refer more to the legal consequences of committing a murder and do not directly address the emotional or moral consequences.
The sentence suggests that the man had a car, but that it caused more problems than benefits while living in the city. The fact that he "still had to walk" suggests that he did not use his car to commute. The most likely reason for this is that he parked his car elsewhere, such as in a parking garage, which would require him to still walk to and from it after commuting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "notoriety" means the state of being famous or well-known, especially for something considered negative or controversial. If the goal of telling many people about a new organization is to gain attention and recognition, then "notoriety" would be the most appropriate answer. The other options do not fit the context as well: "accomplish" suggests achieving a specific objective, "learn about" implies seeking knowledge, "money" implies financial gain, and "religion" limits the scope of the possible goals mentioned.
Stool legs are typically made of metal or wood, and a blacksmith's shop would be a likely place to find someone skilled in metalworking who could create sturdy, durable legs for a stool. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of stool leg construction.
The sentence suggests that the people are scared of someone, which implies that they perceive the person as a threat or a source of danger. The other options lack any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
When traveling to another country, a common mode of transportation is by train. Train stations sell tickets for cross-border trips, and these tickets are necessary to gain entry to another country. The other options, such as a baseball stadium, lottery, movie, or bus, do not have any clear connection to cross-border travel or the need for a ticket to enter another country.
The sentence suggests that playing aggressively can have negative consequences, which may be associated with physical harm or injury. Laughter, having fun, and feeling happy all suggest positive emotions that are commonly associated with enjoyable activities, while getting hungry has no clear connection to playing aggressively.
The sentence implies that the students are actively doing something, and that something is related to asking questions. This suggests that they are in a learning environment, where asking questions is expected and encouraged. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence - becoming an adult, studying philosophy, and furthering education are more general goals that may apply to students, but they do not necessarily describe what the students are doing at the moment. Studying together is a possible activity for students, but it is not mentioned in the sentence.
The question is asking about where farmers keep toothpicks, which suggests that toothpicks are used for something specific on a farm. One possible explanation is that toothpicks are used to clean the teeth of animals, such as horses or cows. Keeping the toothpicks in a box would be a practical way to store them in a organized and accessible manner. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the detective had to carefully examine all of the clues left at the scene to solve the case. The word "analyze" specifically means to examine something in great detail or to break it down into smaller parts, which is exactly what the detective would need to do with the clues. The other options do not match the meaning of the sentence.
The context of the sentence refers to skin color, which is a hereditary trait. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a person with brown skin may share that trait with their family members. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A chain ring is commonly seen in the context of a motorcycle, as it is a component of the motorcycle's drive system. It is used to transfer power from the engine to the rear wheel using a chain. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of screwing a chain ring, and would not require such a component to be used in their construction or repair.
The question is asking where to put a dictionary while it's being used, which implies that the dictionary needs to be easily accessible. A table is a flat surface that is commonly used for tasks that require close attention and access to materials, such as reading or writing. A dictionary is a reference tool that is frequently used alongside other materials, so having it on a table would make it convenient to reach and use while working. The other options (library, study area, classroom, shelf) do not necessarily offer the same level of accessibility or convenience for immediate use.
The phrase "go forth" typically means to move forward or proceed, so the contrasting word or phrase would suggest the opposite of forward movement. The only choice that directly contrasts with "go forth" in this way is "backwards." The other options either repeat words or do not provide an opposite meaning.
The sentence suggests that being awake is related to being aware of what's going on. Being alert is typically associated with being awake and aware of one's surroundings, while deep sleep and drinking coffee may indicate the opposite state of mind. Opening one's eyes is a necessary step to becoming awake, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee alertness. Consciousness is a broad term that could include both wakefulness and other states of awareness.
Swords are typically kept in a container called a scabbard, which is designed to protect and hold the sword while not in use. A sheath is another word for a scabbard, and a sword closet or collection may also contain swords, but neither term specifically refers to the container for the sword. A museum may have swords on display, but they would not be found in your personal house.
The sentence suggests that Bill continued to fight against the enemy, indicating that he actively participated in the conflict rather than giving up or surrendering. "Engage" is commonly used to describe someone who is actively involved in a fight or battle. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest actions that are not related to fighting or conflict.
The word "reserve" suggests that the question is about making a reservation for a place to stay. Among the options, the only one that typically involves reserving a room is a motel. While other places may have showers available, a motel room is the most likely option to have a shower as an expected amenity. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "race" in the question suggests a competition or contest, and humans typically compete with each other in races such as running, swimming, or cycling. The other options such as laying eggs or eating fruit are not relevant to human races, and wrestling may not always be a part of a race. Drawing pictures also has no connection to the context of the question.
The presence of light sensors and automatic doors suggests that the garage is part of a modern house. Such houses typically incorporate cutting-edge technology and design elements that prioritize convenience and efficiency, including features like smart lighting and automated doors. The other options do not provide any indication of the type of house described in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that there is a workplace where people gather near liquid. The option "water cooler" is the most likely choice as it is a common fixture in workplaces where employees often gather to chat and take a break. The other options are not relevant to a workplace context or do not involve liquids. The option "opera" is a cultural event, "hospital" is a medical facility, "hockey game" is a sports event, and "beach" is a recreational spot.
The sentence suggests that the person needs to carry their tent with them while camping. The only option that allows for this is a backpack, which can be worn on a person's back and store a tent inside of it. The other options do not provide a way to carry a tent on one's person.
The sentence suggests that Billy moved away from a place where his parents were fighting. The most likely place for this to occur is at home. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence implies that fox hunting is a common activity in England, and the question is asking where a fox hunting might occur outside of a typical forest habitat. The other options such as arctic tundra or beach do not provide a suitable environment for fox hunting. "Great outdoors" is too broad, and "open meadow" could potentially work, but the sentence does not provide any evidence to support that as a correct answer.
The sentence suggests that Lindy is old enough to be considered a senior, and that he is living with his children. The most likely reason he would do this is if he did not want to go to an old people's home. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
When the ground gets wet, it is likely due to something melting such as snow, ice, or frozen ground. Solidifying would not cause the ground to get wet, but rather the opposite - it would become more solid. Getting cold or feeling cold may be related to weather conditions, but they do not directly explain why the ground is getting wet. Skin rash is not relevant to the context of the question.
The question is asking about where most people keep magazines, which implies that it is a common practice for individuals to keep magazines in a specific location. Out of the choices provided, only "home" fits this criteria as it is the most likely place for an individual to keep their own personal magazines. Bookstores and libraries are locations where magazines can be found, but not necessarily where they are kept by individuals. Doctors' offices may have magazines for patients to read, but again, this is not where most people keep their own magazines. "Table" may be a location within a home where magazines are kept, but this is not necessarily the most common location.
This question is likely referencing the controversial practice of consuming dog meat in some regions of China. While consuming dog meat is not a widespread practice in Chinese cuisine, it does exist in some regions and has been subject to criticism from animal rights organizations. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Counseling is a form of therapy where a person can talk to a trained professional about their problems or concerns in a safe and non-judgmental environment. An important part of counseling is the therapist's ability to listen actively and provide empathetic responses that validate the person's feelings and promote self-awareness. Therefore, going to counseling is usually for the purpose of getting a chance to talk and be heard, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of oneself. The other options do not accurately reflect the primary goals of counseling.
A water spout is a weather phenomenon, which is commonly seen in coastal areas during thunderstorms. Florida is a coastal state and is known for experiencing frequent thunderstorms, which makes it a likely location for a water spout to occur. The other options such as basement, sink, beach, and fountain do not have any connection with the context of the sentence.
The Empire State building is widely known for being one of the tallest buildings in the world, so the answer is likely to be "tall." The other options do not make sense in the context of the question - the Empire State building is not small, underground, or huge, though it certainly is high!
The use of the term "frat boys" suggests that the sentence is referencing a group of college-aged men who engage in partying and sexual activities. The phrase "have fun" is often used as a euphemism for engaging in sexual activity, and the specific wording "get laid" is a more explicit way of expressing this. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the behavior associated with frat parties.
The phrase "having fun" typically implies that someone is enjoying themselves and finding pleasure in the activity they are engaged in. Laughing is a common physical expression of happiness and enjoyment, so it would make sense for someone who is having fun to also be laughing. The other choices, such as smoking or stress relief, do not necessarily correlate with having fun.
Jogging is a form of exercise that can burn calories, which can contribute to weight loss. The other answer choices, such as feeling pride or getting tired, are not necessarily goals of jogging. Additionally, "run away" is not a common or appropriate goal for jogging.
The sentence mentions smoke detectors going off, which suggests that there was a potential danger of fire. However, the sentence also states that it was a false alarm, meaning that there was no actual fire. This narrows down the possible reasons for John being stuck to something other than a fire. The sentence also mentions a winter storm, which is a more likely explanation for John being stuck in his house. Face south and belong to are unrelated to the context of the sentence, while burn down is a possible consequence of a fire but not a reason for John being stuck.
The phrase "master control for the Tardis" suggests that this is a specific location within a larger structure or vehicle. The word "center" is also commonly associated with control panels, command centers, or other central locations for operations. The other options - nuclear power plant, basement, main office, and bowel of the ship - are either irrelevant, too specific, or too general to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the old barn was damaged to the point that it couldn't be repaired, and therefore needed to be demolished before a new one could be constructed in its place. The word "build" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as the other options do not relate to the idea of constructing a new barn. "Make" and "entice" do not make sense in connection with a barn, while "raise" is typically used in reference to money or raising animals, not constructing a building.
A shopping bag for packing groceries is typically provided by a supermarket or grocery store for customers to carry their purchased items. The other options (home, closet, mart, hardware store) are not relevant as they do not typically provide shopping bags for this purpose.
The context of the sentence suggests that the lady is concerned about the safety of people in their area, as the article discusses an increase in accidents. The husband's response implies that accidents are a common occurrence and that they happen to people. The other options may also be true, but they do not directly relate to the context of the article or the conversation between the couple.
An anthology refers to a collection of literary works or episodes from a television series that are related in some way. In the given sentence, it is mentioned that there was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, and the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers. This suggests that both episodes were related to the theme of flowers, and were part of an anthology series that focused on different aspects of gardening or nature. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the cupboards were empty or barren, meaning there were no ingredients or food available to cook with. Therefore, the only option left for them to eat was to leave the house and obtain food from an external source. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not address the lack of food in the cupboards.
Fleas are known for their ability to jump, and this is their primary mode of locomotion. Fleas use their powerful hind legs to propel themselves up to 200 times their body length, allowing them to move quickly and efficiently through fur or hair. The other options - attack, suck blood, stay, and lay eggs - are all behaviors or actions associated with fleas, but do not describe how they move.
While it is possible to find prostitutes on the street corner, this option may not be the most reliable or safe. A more professional and regulated location for prostitution would be a brothel or whorehouse, which is likely to offer a higher level of safety and hygiene. New York is also known for having a high concentration of sex workers, making it a likely choice for finding a professional prostitute. The option "corner of two streets" does not provide any relevant information to this question, and "brother" is completely unrelated.
The sentence suggests that the object being referred to is a light source that is decorative and vintage. This description is most commonly associated with lamps, which are often used for their aesthetic value as well as their functional purpose of providing light. The other options (sun, sky, candle, house) either do not fit the context of the sentence or are not commonly associated with being vintage or decorative light sources.
The question suggests that the person is unable to leave their house but still has a desire to learn or explore a topic. Surfing the internet would allow them to access a wide range of information and resources about the topic of interest without having to physically leave their home. The other options require leaving the house, such as going to see exhibits, attending an outdoor concert, or hearing testimony in person.
The sentence states that Sam was against Allison's decision and Joe was the opposite. This suggests that Joe was not against Allison's decision like Sam was, but rather for it. The option "being for" expresses this idea directly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or convey the opposite of Sam's stance in relation to Allison's decision.
Working with wood can be physically demanding and requires the use of tools that can create friction against the skin, leading to blisters. This suggests that the reason for not wanting to work with wood may be related to physical discomfort. The other options are focused on financial or emotional reasons, which do not relate to the physical pain of blisters.
The sentence implies that the person was better at social science than traditional science, and that social science was their favorite subject. Geography, history studies, and religion could fall under the category of social science, but the sentence doesn't specifically mention them as being the person's favorite subject. Math and dancing are not related to either traditional or social science, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the gentleman in question is very rich and likes to show it off. Living in a palace would be a fitting choice as they are grand and luxurious buildings typically associated with wealth and status. The other options, such as "big house" or "men's room," do not necessarily connote wealth or lavishness in the same way that a palace would.
A bookstore is a type of retail establishment that specializes in selling books, so it is likely to be found in a location where there is a significant population of book buyers. Towns and cities are both likely to have bookstores, although they may differ in their size and variety of offerings. Carpeting, phone books, and magazines are not likely to be places where one can find a bookstore.
The sentence suggests that Jill was not well-liked or respected by many people, except for John. The word "respect" indicates that John held her in high regard, but the phrase "not many other people did" indicates that most others did not feel the same way about Jill. The word "disparagement" means criticism or belittlement, which could explain why Jill was not well-liked or respected by many people. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the person has trouble beginning work, which can be a symptom of procrastination. Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing something that needs to be done, often due to a feeling of anxiety or a lack of motivation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as sitting down, excitement, tiredness, and progress do not necessarily have a direct link to starting work.
The sentence implies that waiting for the doctor is a problem for people who need to do work, which suggests that the waiting process takes up a significant amount of time. "Time consuming" is a phrase commonly used to describe activities that take up large amounts of time or resources, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why waiting for the doctor would be difficult for people who need to do work.
The question suggests that the goal is to ensure viewing enjoyment while not experiencing curiosity, which may imply that the person wants to watch something familiar or comforting. Watching a favorite show is likely to provide entertainment and a sense of familiarity, which could satisfy the desire for viewing enjoyment. The other options, such as examining things or staring into a mirror, do not relate to watching something for entertainment or enjoyment. Hearing news or going somewhere may spark curiosity, which is not what the question is asking for.
The sentence implies that the gambler had won a significant amount of money and chose to do something with it. "Cash in" is a common phrase used to describe the act of exchanging something for money, which would make sense in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The phrase "make love" is a common euphemism for engaging in sexual activities with a partner. Given that the question asks about what a lover is likely to want to do with their partner, it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer pertains to intimacy or physical affection. The other options may be desirable outcomes in a relationship, but they do not specifically relate to physical intimacy.
The sentence suggests that the person filling the bag with clothes will need to go to a retail location where bags are typically provided after purchase. Shopping malls are a common location for retail shops that sell clothes and provide bags for customers to carry their purchases. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that the sample needed to be pure, but the lab assistant did something to it that affected its purity. The word "contaminated" means that something has been made impure or tainted, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices don't fit with the context, as they don't describe something that could happen to a sample in a lab.
Historically, leeches were commonly used in medical treatments to "let blood" from a patient's body as a means of addressing various ailments. This practice was known as bloodletting and was believed to balance the body's humors, or fluids. While leeches have also been used in modern medicine for certain purposes (such as promoting blood circulation and reducing swelling), bloodletting is generally considered a outdated and ineffective treatment. The other options (heart transplant, distance himself, perform surgery, study medicine) do not have any connection to the historical use of leeches.
The sentence implies that the person is actively seeking new experiences or opportunities in their life, which suggests a desire for change. The phrase "looking for new things" is a clear indication of their motivations, and the option "welcome change" best captures this sentiment. The other options are either irrelevant or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about where to put a handle if you want to bring the object with you. Out of the choices given, only "carry object" makes sense because a handle on a carry object, such as a bag or suitcase, is designed to make it easier to transport. The other options do not make sense in this context - a handle on a coffee cup or frying pan would not make it easier to carry, and a handle on a hat would not serve a practical purpose for transportation.
It is a basic requirement to have money or financial resources before buying any products. Desire and needs may influence the decision to purchase, but ultimately, having the monetary means to pay for the item is necessary. Spending money and time are not prerequisites for purchasing, as the former implies that the money has already been spent, and the latter may not be relevant to the context of buying products.
The sentence mentions that they were competing in basketball, which is a sport where the objective is to score points by throwing the ball into the opposing team's basket. The other options are not the specific objective of basketball, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that traveling can be tiring, which typically leads to a feeling of exhaustion or weariness. This is commonly referred to as fatigue. Sickness and motion sickness are unrelated to the context of traveling, while relocation refers to a permanent move rather than a one-time trip. Jet lag is a common side effect of traveling across time zones, but it is more specific than the general feeling of fatigue that the question is asking about.
The sentence implies that being great at something requires more than luck, and that a person needs to have a certain quality in order to achieve greatness. The use of the word "focus" suggests that this quality is related to being committed and determined, which can be further described as "dedication". The other options do not match the meaning of the sentence, as hatred and surprised have negative connotations, compliments are not related to achieving greatness, and solutions do not fit the context.
The question is asking about the effect of exposure to noises on humans. Hearing sounds is the most logical answer as it is a direct and immediate effect of exposure to noise. The other options, such as petting a dog, having sex, or driving cars, do not have a clear connection to the context of the question. Reproduction may be a possible long-term effect of noise exposure, but it is not an immediate or certain outcome.
The sentence implies that the purpose of listening to an expert speak is to gain knowledge or information. Learning is a common reason why people attend lectures or speeches given by experts. Fatigue, mercy, empathy, and anxiety do not relate to the context of gaining knowledge from an expert speaker.
An old copy machine would likely be found in an office since copy machines are commonly used in work environments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they are less likely places to find a copy machine.
The sentence implies that the child has to do a task related to cleaning up after breakfast. Washing dishes is a common chore that is performed after meals. The other options, such as dropping out of school or entering school, are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Asking questions and reading a book might be something a child does, but it is not something that has to be done before getting on the bus.
The phrase "dime a dozen" suggests that the large container is very common and easily found. The options that fit this description are factory, supermarket, garage, and warehouse. However, the mention of "hundreds of rows" suggests that the container is being stored in a large space, which is most likely a warehouse. The other options do not fit the context as well.
The sentence indicates that the snake in question is a cottonmouth, which is a venomous snake found in the southeastern United States. One of the states where this snake is commonly found is Georgia, making it the correct choice. The other options do not provide any relevant information about where the snake might be from.
The question is asking about what surface one would place furniture on, which logically would be a flat surface within a living space. The options "roof," "apartment," and "neighbor's house" do not fit this description, whereas "room" and "floor" do. However, a room can have furniture placed on the walls or ceiling if it is designed that way, whereas a floor is always a surface meant for furniture placement.
The question is asking about a way to view a county highway as a line, which implies a visual representation. The most likely option is a map, which shows highways and roads as lines for navigational purposes. The other options (from the sky, cross counties by car, country, michigan) do not specifically relate to the ability to view a highway as a line.
The sentence implies that stress can lead to a serious health consequence that could be fatal if not quickly addressed. Heart attacks are a common consequence of stress, as stress can cause the heart to work harder and increase blood pressure. The other options are also potential effects of stress, but they are not specifically mentioned as having the potential for a life-threatening outcome.
The sentence implies that the person is settling down to watch a movie, which is an activity commonly associated with a cinema or movie theater. The other options (park, Martorell, jeep, airplane) do not provide a suitable location for watching a movie.
The sentence suggests that the location where you can read a magazine is a place where you wait for transportation on rails to arrive. This limits the options to train stations, as they are the only location where transportation on rails typically arrives and departures. The other options, such as airports, bookstores, and newsstands, do not fit the criteria outlined in the sentence. Waiting room could potentially fit, but it is not specific enough to suggest that transportation on rails is involved.
The sentence mentions that the farmer chose plants he could make bird feed from and use again the next year. This suggests that the farmer planted seed crops, which are plants grown specifically for their seeds that can be used for replanting or for feeding birds. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that cake might be served alongside ice cream in a social setting, such as a party or celebration. Eating cake and ice cream together is a common tradition for birthdays and other special occasions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context or tradition of serving cake with ice cream.
The sentence explicitly states that James lived in a tall tower, which is a structure that is commonly associated with being high up and providing a good view of the surrounding area. Additionally, the sentence mentions that James can see clouds from his window, which further supports the idea that he is living high above ground level. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as living in books, working at a radio station, or living in a medieval castle do not involve living in a tall tower.
The sentence indicates that the police wanted to clear the scene of an accident, which implies that there was a traffic buildup or obstruction. To address this, the police would likely direct traffic to clear the area and prevent further accidents or delays. The other options either do not relate to the context of the sentence or are not actions the police would typically take in this situation.
The phrase "betting with a shark" is likely meant figuratively, as sharks are known for being predatory and aggressive in various contexts. Betting in a pool hall, a place where people often play billiards or other games for money, can attract players who are skilled or "sharks" at the game. The other options do not make sense in the context of the phrase.
When someone writes a check, it is typically for payment of goods or services. The clerk would take the check and process it by depositing it into the cash register as payment for the sale. The desk drawer, pay envelope, throw away, and box options do not make sense as places to put a check after receiving it as payment.
The word "performers" suggests that the context is related to live entertainment. The phrase "on a platform" indicates that the performers are elevated and visible to an audience, which is commonly found in concert halls. Arenas can also have performers on a platform, but they are more commonly associated with sporting events. A building or museum may have performers, but they are unlikely to be on a platform in a public space. A dock is not a common location for performers, and the sentence does not suggest that the performers are on a boat or ship.
The sentence implies that the person was searching for holiday decorations in a specific location, and unexpectedly found an old box of clothes. The most likely location for someone to store items they don't frequently use, such as decorations or old clothes, is in the attic. The other options, such as trash or closet, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
The word "yard" typically refers to a small area of land around a house or building. Farmland, property, and subdivision all suggest larger pieces of land, so they are unlikely to have a "tiny" yard. City could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough to make a definitive choice. Neighborhood, on the other hand, suggests a smaller, more densely populated area where yards might indeed be small.
The question suggests that love is something that many people continue to feel, even though it may be difficult or painful at times. The wording of the question implies that love is a lasting emotion, rather than something that is temporary or fleeting. The other options do not accurately reflect the common understanding of love, which is often associated with long-term commitment and lasting emotional connection.
The word "staple" suggests that balloons are a common and important element at this event. Balloons are often associated with celebrations, and birthday parties are a common occasion where they are used as decorations or given as gifts. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way.
The question is asking about how to transport potatoes from a location to another, suggesting that it is a small amount intended for personal use rather than a large quantity for commercial purposes. Grocery stores are one option for purchasing potatoes, but a bushel basket would be too large for personal use. Restaurants would not be relevant in this context, and while farmer's markets can be a source for potatoes, they are typically sold in smaller quantities that can be easily carried in a bag.
Paper programs are typically provided at live performances, such as theater productions and concerts, as a way for audience members to follow along with the program and learn more about the performance. The other options, such as computer, television, and opera, do not typically provide paper programs as a part of the experience.
The sentence suggests that Billy was playing a game that involved bouncing a ball off a wall, which is a common activity in playrooms. Playrooms often have designated play areas and toys, which could include a ball and a target on the wall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking how an artist can immortalize or remember a horse, and one common way to do this is through a painting. Artists often create portraits of horses to capture their beauty and personality, and these paintings can serve as a lasting tribute to the animal. The other options - hoof, Kentucky Derby, race track, and Triple Crown - are all related to horse racing and do not necessarily involve artistic expression.
The question is asking about where people live, which suggests looking for options related to human habitation. The option "surface of earth" is the most logical choice since it encompasses all areas where people can live, including apartments and houses. The other options are not related to human habitation at all, making them incorrect answers.
The context of the question suggests that the answer should relate to a living thing with a literal lip, which eliminates options like "can" or "Kentucky fried chicken." While both humans and snakes have lips, the latter is more commonly associated with a physical "lip" in the form of the curved upper and lower jaws that make up the snake's mouth. Therefore, the correct answer is "snake."
The question suggests that the color yellow is associated with a characteristic that is the opposite of "fearless." This may be because yellow is often associated with caution or warning, which is a characteristic that might be perceived as lacking in courage or fearlessness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The term "instituting civil action" refers to bringing a legal case against someone in a civil court. The other options are not related to legal proceedings and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The word "celebrating" typically implies joy and happiness, which would make "happiness" the most appropriate choice. While "drinking" or "dancing" may be activities that take place during a celebration, they are not necessarily indicative of the overall mood or feeling of the occasion. "Intimacy" also does not fit the context of a celebration, as it suggests a more personal and private setting. "Enjoyment" could be a possible alternative, but "happiness" is a more direct and appropriate choice.
The sentence mentions a large delivery of shampoo, which implies that it is being delivered to a place that uses a lot of it. The options "supermarket" and "hotel" could also use a lot of shampoo, but the mention of a crate suggests a larger quantity than these locations might typically use. "Shampoo bottle" is unlikely since it refers to a product rather than a location. "Motel" is possible but less likely than "hair salon" since motels may offer other toiletries besides shampoo. Therefore, the best answer is "hair salon."
The phrase "balls of cotton" suggests that the man is looking for some sort of medical supply, likely for cleaning or bandaging a wound. Of the given options, "pocket" is most likely to contain such an item, as people often carry first aid supplies in their pockets or bags. The other options ("south," "Georgia," "North Carolina") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "medicine cabinet" would only be applicable if the man were at home or in a medical facility.
Based on the sentence, it is implied that a rosebush is being discussed and there are no containers available to store it. A flower garden is a logical place to plant a rosebush as it provides the necessary soil and space for the plant to grow. A garden center is where you might buy a rosebush, but it is not a place to plant it. A pot is a container and contradicts the initial statement. A formal garden may or may not have a specific place for a rosebush, but it is not the logical choice without further information.
The question implies that the paper in question is not available for purchase. Therefore, it is unlikely to be found in an office supply store or a printer. A cabinet or a suitcase might contain paper, but there is nothing in the question to suggest that the paper is located there. An artist's studio, however, is a logical place to find large pieces of paper that may be used for artwork and may not be sold to the public.
The sentence suggests that James is hesitant to take a particular action because he fears it will ruin his relationship with Jen. However, he also believes that taking this action might have a positive outcome related to fixing or repairing something. The word "fix" implies that there is something that needs improvement or repair and that James believes this action might help to resolve that issue. The other answer choices do not relate to the context of the sentence or suggest a positive outcome.
When driving at high speeds, it is important to have the ability to stop quickly and safely. This is typically achieved through the use of brakes, which slow down the car and bring it to a stop. Stripes and radios are not related to driving performance or safety, while seat belts are important for overall safety but not specifically related to stopping at a light. Tires may also play a role in braking ability, but are not as directly related as the brakes themselves.
Bob needs a level to hang a shelf, which is a tool used to ensure that objects are straight and even. While the options "glass of water" and "build evenly" may suggest methods to make things straight, they do not provide an answer to where Bob can obtain a level. The option "garage" is too general and does not specify whether there is someone in the garage who may have a level. The option "video game" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the only logical option is "carpenter's shop," where Bob can purchase or borrow a level.
The question is asking about a reason why professionals playing sports would be unable to compete. The most likely reason is due to injuries, which can range from minor sprains and strains to more severe fractures and tears. Pain, sweating, and rain may all be uncomfortable or inconvenient, but they would not necessarily prevent athletes from competing. A mudslide is a rare and extreme weather event that would likely result in the cancellation or postponement of a game, rather than simply preventing athletes from competing.
A concerto is a classical musical form that typically features a soloist accompanied by an orchestra. Therefore, it would be most likely for a musician to perform a concerto for clarinet with an orchestra. The other choices, such as music store, jazz band, rock band, and music studio, do not typically feature orchestral performances of classical music.
The sentence is discussing a newborn opening its eyes for the first time, suggesting that it is experiencing visual stimuli for the first time. Therefore, the correct answer should involve sight. "See light" is the most obvious choice, as it describes the normal response to opening one's eyes. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to the action of opening one's eyes for the first time.
A shed is a small outdoor storage unit typically used for lawnmowers, garden tools, and other outdoor equipment. The sentence indicates that the shed would be located in a town, which suggests that the options "farm yard" and "ranch" are not appropriate choices. The shed is also meant to be close to the house, as per the option "next to the house." However, the best location for a shed in a town is often the backyard because it allows for easy access to the outdoors while keeping the shed out of sight and secure.
The sentence suggests that James's bouncing rubber balls were active and bouncing before he went to sleep, and that he had to put them back in that state in the morning. Therefore, the correct choice would be "in motion." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Meowing is a common vocalization that cats use to communicate with humans and other cats. It is often used to express a variety of needs or desires, such as wanting attention or needing food. The other options do not relate to typical cat behavior or vocalizations.
The sentence suggests that people are receiving bills along with bread, which implies that the bills are being sent through some sort of delivery system. Envelopes are commonly used to send bills and other documents through the mail, making them the most likely answer in this context. The other options do not have a clear connection to the concept of receiving bills through the mail.
An atlas is a commonly used paper map that shows roads, highways, and other geographical features. It is a useful tool for people who are traveling and need to find their way along a specific route. The other options, such as the United States or parks, are not useful for navigation purposes when traveling along a highway.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was comfortable in their own home, but had a fear of going somewhere else. The word "crippling" implies that the fear is severe and debilitating. The option "outside" is the most logical choice, as it is the opposite of being inside one's own home and could potentially cause discomfort or anxiety for someone with a fear of leaving their safe space. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Lemurs are primates that are native to Madagascar, an island country off the east coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to many different types of rain forests, including tropical rain forests, which are likely the habitats where native lemurs would be found. The other options do not provide any real connection with the natural habitat of lemurs.
The question mentions a specific location, a red bridge, which suggests that the answer is a place where such a bridge exists. The choices "refrigerator," "engineering school," and "tree" do not fit this criterion. The choice "market" could potentially work, as some markets have decorative bridges, but the most likely answer is "san francisco" as the city is famous for its landmark Golden Gate Bridge, which is red and has pedestrian walkways where people could eat fruit.
The question references a place to keep head wear in an entrance hall, which typically suggests a small space or area. The options "school," "large home," and "house" do not fit this context. The option "closet" could be a possibility, but the question specifically mentions head wear and a hat rack is more commonly associated with storing hats. Therefore, the correct answer is "hat rack."
The sentence suggests that John needs access to electricity for cooking, which is commonly found at rest areas along highways and roads. Rest areas are designed for travelers to take breaks and often have amenities like restrooms and electricity hookups for RVs. The other options do not have any clear connection to providing electricity for an RV.
Turkey is located in both Europe and Asia, but the majority of its land lies within the region of Asia Minor, which is also known as Anatolia. This region is located in western Asia and encompasses most of modern-day Turkey. The other options are not correct geographical regions for Turkey.
The question suggests that something that is surprising and unexpected can make people happy, and the options are related to humor and emotions. Jokes and humor are often associated with making people happy, but they are not necessarily surprising and unexpected. Frightened and fight are related to negative emotions and do not relate to making people happy. Laughter is a common response to humor and unexpected situations, and can be a sign of happiness or amusement. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be laughter.
The sentence suggests that the location must be a place where lizards live in their natural habitat and where Spanish may not be the primary language. Utah and New Hampshire may have lizards, but they are not typically associated with Spanish-speaking communities or culture. Japan is not known for its reptiles, and South America is a large continent with many countries, some of which may speak Spanish. New Mexico, on the other hand, has a variety of lizard species and is known for its culture and history that includes both Spanish and Native American influences.
The other options in the list (suitcase, department store, safe deposit box) all suggest a level of security and protection for the jewelry during travel. However, "lady's boudoir" does not provide any security measures and may even make the jewelry more vulnerable to theft or loss. Therefore, it is not a safe way to transport jewelry on vacation.
The sentence suggests that Johnny wants the conflict between him and Bill to end. The most logical option would be to settle everything, meaning to resolve the issue between them and come to a mutual agreement. The other options are not relevant to the context and may even make the situation worse.
The sentence suggests that the man spends a significant amount of time grooming himself each morning, which implies that he values his appearance. Looking good is the most likely outcome of such a regular grooming routine. Tardiness and injury can be ruled out as they are negative outcomes that do not relate to grooming. Vacation is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Neatness may be a possible result, but is less likely than looking good as the focus of the sentence is on the man's grooming routine rather than his overall tidiness.
The sentence suggests that Sarah found a second heart in the chest of a patient, which indicates that the patient is not a typical human being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The use of the word "surprise" suggests that the attack caught the opposing force off guard, implying that they were not prepared to defend themselves. Therefore, the attack likely brought an end to the defending force's ability to continue resisting or protecting themselves, making "defence" the correct answer. Surrender would imply that the defending force chose to yield, while retreat suggests they were able to withdraw instead of being defeated. Cease fire implies a mutual agreement to stop fighting, rather than a single force being defeated. Defend is not the correct answer because it is the action taken by the defenders, rather than what the attack ended.
Potatoes are a staple food in Ireland and have played a significant role in the country's history and economy. The potato industry in Ireland dates back to the late 16th century when potatoes were first introduced to the country. Today, Ireland is one of the largest potato producers in Europe, with potatoes being a key component of many traditional Irish dishes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the potato industry.
The sentence suggests that dancing for a long time can have a negative impact on the body, which is commonly associated with fatigue. Fatigue is a condition where the body feels tired or weak, often as a result of physical activity or lack of rest. The other options do not accurately describe the effects of dancing for a long time. Soreness is a possible symptom of fatigue, but it is not a direct result of dancing. Intercourse and expression are unrelated to the topic of dancing for a long time.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about where the majority of people keep their personal curling iron. According to common conventions and habit, people tend to store their personal grooming devices such as curling irons in their bathrooms, which is the most appropriate option among the given choices. The other options don't quite fit because they are not commonly used for storing personal grooming tools like curling irons.
The sentence indicates that the location was once home to a thriving fishing industry, which suggests that it would have been a town or village situated by the sea. The option "resort" implies that the area was primarily developed for tourism, while "ocean" and "beach" are not specific enough to identify a location. "California" is a state and not an appropriate answer for this specific question.
Becoming inebriated or drunk can impair a person's ability to speak coherently and communicate effectively. This is because alcohol affects the brain's ability to process information, making it difficult to concentrate and think clearly. As a result, people who are intoxicated are more likely to slurr their words, mumble, or say nonsensical things. The other options are either consequences of becoming drunk (regret, automobile accidents, drunk driving) or unrelated to the question (talk intelligently).
The question is asking for something that can break up or eliminate a mundane routine, which suggests the need for something different or fresh. The word "new" is directly associated with this idea of introducing something different, and is therefore the most appropriate answer. The other choices - "sophisticated," "arcane," "heavenly," and "imprevist" - do not directly relate to the concept of breaking up a mundane routine, and are therefore incorrect.
A master carpenter is skilled in the craft of woodworking and uses various tools to create and modify objects made from wood. A drill is a commonly used tool for creating holes in wood, and is therefore the correct answer. "Learn," "understand," and "require obedience" are not relevant to the context of the question or to the skill set of a master carpenter. "Spoon" is a tool, but not typically used for creating holes in wood.
Falling from a mountain can be a very dangerous situation, and it is likely to result in severe injury or death. "Die" is the most appropriate answer because it accurately reflects the gravity of the situation. "Act dead" and "explode" do not make sense in this context, while "too much" and "rush" are not fitting choices as they do not pertain to falling from a mountain.
The question is asking for a reason why someone is not listening to music. The answer "deafness" makes the most sense as it is a medical condition where a person cannot hear any sound. The other options are all possible activities or moods that someone might be experiencing while not listening to music, but they do not provide a clear reason for why they are not able to hear it.
The sentence describes David as tired, shaking, and in pain, which suggests that he is experiencing exhaustion or fatigue. The sentence also mentions that he hasn't gotten what he needed in a long time, which could suggest that he has been overworking or not getting enough rest. Addiction may cause physical symptoms, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Relaxation and overeating do not fit with the symptoms described. Headaches could cause pain, but they are not strongly suggested by the context.
The word "moistener" suggests that the item being referred to is likely a product for moisturizing the skin. The options of bathroom, purse, and water do not provide any indication of where such a product might be found. Hand lotion is a similar product, but not necessarily the same as a moistener. Therefore, the best option is a drug store, which is a common place to find moisturizing products such as lotions and creams.
The sentence suggests that there is a specific saucepan that is only used for marinara, and therefore it is likely that this saucepan is kept in a convenient and accessible location in the kitchen. The other options are unlikely to be the correct answer, as they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Vegetarians are people who choose not to eat meat, including beef, pork, chicken, and fish. Instead, they often consume a plant-based diet that includes fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Therefore, the answer that corresponds with a vegetarian's behavior is "eat plants." None of the other answer choices are associated with being a vegetarian.
The phrase "many a song and dance" is commonly associated with musicals, which are movies that incorporate songs and dance into the story. Bollywood is a type of Indian cinema that often features song and dance numbers, but this term is not commonly used to refer to musicals outside of India. Record, jukebox, and Napster have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Danny was enjoying himself while singing in front of his class. Glee is a feeling of great happiness and enjoyment, which fits the context of the sentence. Laughter and being happy are similar but do not specifically fit with the act of singing, while opera and injuries are not relevant to the context at all.
The context of the question suggests that the system of electronic devices is related to education, specifically in a school setting. "Computer science" is the only option that is related to technology and education, and it is common for schools to use electronic devices such as computers and tablets in computer science classes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Reproduction is a biological process that involves the joining of sperm and egg cells to create a new organism. In humans, this typically occurs through sexual intercourse where sperm is transferred from the male to the female reproductive system. Eating ice cream, sitting down, making mistakes, and hearing sounds are all unrelated to reproduction and do not provide any contextual clues to suggest they are the correct answer.
The use of the word "guilty" in the sentence suggests that the murderer was found to be at fault for the killing. The judge's use of the word "pure" suggests that the murderer's actions were completely wrong or immoral. The other options do not accurately capture the severity of being found guilty of murder.
The sentence suggests that the method being described involves using violence to bring about change in society. This is commonly associated with the term "revolution," which refers to a drastic and sometimes violent change in the political or social order. The other options do not convey the same sense of upheaval and change that is implied by the use of violence to bring about societal transformation.
The sentence suggests that there was a change in the formula of Coca-Cola, which was known as "new coke," but it was later discontinued. The question then asks what formula was used after that. Therefore, the correct answer would be the original formula, as it was the formula used before the introduction of "new coke." The other options, such as "old," "coke clear," "former," and "familiar," do not indicate what formula was used after "new coke" was discontinued.
Monkeys are arboreal animals, which means they live primarily in trees. Rainforests are known for their dense foliage and tall trees, which provide ideal habitat for monkeys to climb and swing from branch to branch. While it is possible to see monkeys in zoological gardens or zoos, they are often kept in enclosures or exhibits and may not have access to actual trees. "Rainforest" and "great outdoors" are too general and do not provide specific information about where in the rainforest a monkey may be found.
The sentence suggests that the donation allowed the college to construct something related to science, which would require a specialized building. Fraternity houses and banks are not typically associated with science, while "big town" and "big city" are not specific enough to be a likely answer. Therefore, "building" is the most reasonable choice.
Breathing involves the inhalation of air, which contains oxygen, and the exhalation of waste gases like carbon dioxide. The lungs and diaphragm are organs involved in the breathing process, while the abdominal muscles and open throat are not directly involved. Therefore, the correct answer would be oxygen.
The sentence suggests that the person does not have positive feelings towards the other person and wants them to fail. Antipathy means a strong feeling of dislike or hostility towards someone, which fits the context of the sentence. Unfeeling means lacking in emotion or compassion, but it does not necessarily imply a negative feeling towards someone. Negligence means the failure to take proper care, and indifferent means having no particular interest or sympathy. Rapport means a close and harmonious relationship, which is the opposite of what the sentence describes.
The word "reckless" suggests that the driving behavior is dangerous and potentially harmful. The options "injuries" and "accidents" are both related to the negative effects of reckless driving, whereas "fatigue" and "tired" suggest a different type of driving behavior. "Traffic jams" are not necessarily caused by reckless driving, although it can contribute to it in some cases.
The sentence suggests that the containers were on a long sea journey and needed to be unloaded. The most logical place for this to happen would be at a port, which is a location where ships can dock and unload their cargo. The other options, such as cargo ship or refrigerator, do not make sense in this context as they are not places where containers can be unloaded. Food and lorry may be associated with transporting goods but do not provide a clear answer to where the containers are unloaded.
Lions are primarily found in the grasslands and savannahs of Africa, which are characterized by tall grasses and scattered trees. The other options, such as the ocean and jungle, are not suitable habitats for lions due to their different environments and lack of suitable prey. The veldt is similar to a savannah and could be a possible answer, but the context of the question and the more commonly used term "savannah" suggests that it is the more likely answer.
The sentence mentions that the person's favorite type of entertainment are rollercoasters and ferris wheels, which are commonly found at fairgrounds or amusement parks. The other options do not offer similar attractions and are not relevant to the person's interests.
The phrase "getting lots of attention" suggests that the ferret is in a place where people are interacting with it frequently. A petting zoo is a place where people can interact with animals, including ferrets, and give them attention, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. A ferret in a trouser leg, sick bay, own home, or mother's hair may not necessarily be getting a lot of attention.
To confirm an applicant's reference means to verify the information provided by the applicant with the reference. If the reference denies any knowledge of the applicant, it would fail to confirm the reference. The other options do not necessarily imply a failure to confirm the reference. Questioning, disputing, contradicting, or refusing to provide information may still allow for some verification of the applicant's credentials.
The sentence suggests that the group raised their drinks as a gesture of celebration or acknowledgement. The phrase "cheered" further solidifies this idea. "Toasting" is a common action associated with raising a drink in celebration, which makes it the most appropriate choice. "Thirsty" and "refreshment" are not accurate options, as they do not suggest any kind of celebration or gesture of acknowledgement. "Getting drunk" is possible but is not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that there is a person playing a guitar, and someone is watching them. The most logical activity for the watcher to be engaged in would be to listen to the music being played. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - auditioning applies to a different scenario, hear sounds is too general, making music implies that the watcher is also playing, and arthritis is a medical condition that is unrelated to the sentence.
The sentence implies that the animals had difficulty swimming, which could make it harder for them to find a mate and reproduce sexually. Therefore, they may have had to resort to asexual reproduction, which does not require the ability to swim or find a mate. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that a microphone boom is likely to be present at a specific type of event, and that event is related to the stock market. This immediately eliminates options like concert, gig, and recording studio, which are not typically associated with stock market events. TV studios are commonly used to broadcast live events, including stock market events, and New York is a major financial center where many such events take place. However, the sentence only suggests a likelihood, so the answer cannot be determined with complete certainty without further information.
The question suggests that something important is happening to John, which is likely to evoke a positive emotion. The choice "being happy" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the most commonly associated emotion with receiving or achieving something important. The other options, such as "headaches" and "wanting more," do not align with the context of the sentence and are not likely to be related to the emotion that John is feeling. The choice "stoic" also does not fit, as it refers to a person being unemotional and not showing any feelings.
The sentence suggests that James made a decision about how the AI should be raised based on his belief that a religious upbringing would have negative consequences. The other options (eternal, unpredictable, holy, and monastic) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the owner is restricting the kitten's access to certain areas of the house, specifically the bedroom. Therefore, the correct answer would be "closed" as this implies that the owner is keeping the door shut to prevent the kitten from entering the room. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "opened" contradicts the idea of restricting access while "found at shower" and "falling down" are unrelated to the sentence. "Locked" is a possibility, but is not explicitly stated and "closed" is the more common way of restricting a pet's access to a specific room.
The sentence implies that whatever happens to cats every day is a regular and necessary part of their routine. Cats, like all animals, need water to survive, and therefore it makes sense that they would drink water every day. While some cats may enjoy playing or annoying others, these actions are not necessary for their survival and do not happen every day for all cats. The other options, such as opening doors or needing food, could happen every day for some cats but are not as universal as drinking water.
The sentence implies that the person had a job where they danced and waved an advertisement outside of somewhere. This suggests that they were hired to attract attention to a particular store or business. The other options (advertisement, magazine, web page, bus) do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they are not physical locations where someone could dance and wave an advertisement.
The question asks what activity is related to listening to music. Out of the given choices, only "play piano" directly relates to listening to music. Skating and having fun are not related to music, and "fiddle" is a musical instrument, but the question does not specify if the person knows how to play it or if it involves listening to already recorded music.
A teakettle is a small kitchen appliance used for boiling water, typically used to make tea or coffee. It is usually kept on the countertop for easy access when a hot beverage is desired. While it is possible to keep a teakettle in a cupboard, it would not be the most convenient location for frequent use. Water and hardware department have no connection to the question, while England is a location and not a place to store a teakettle.
Bleachers are typically associated with outdoor sports events where spectators need to sit on a temporary structure. Movies, opera, and theater commonly have permanent seating with individual seats. Lecture halls may have fixed seating arrangements, but they are not typically referred to as bleachers. Therefore, the option that best fits the description of bleachers is a hockey game, or any outdoor sports event.
The sentence suggests that someone has a broken leg and needs to elevate it. The most logical place for them to do this would be on a hospital bed, as this is where medical care is typically provided and where patients can receive treatment for a broken leg. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "Why did the chicken cross the road?" is a famous joke, and the punchline is "To get to the other side." Therefore, the answer is "cross road." The other options are not related to the joke or the behavior of chickens in the joke.
The sentence suggests that researchers were seeking something urgently in response to the fast-spreading disease. "Cure" is the most likely answer as it refers to a solution for a disease. The other options ("cause spots on leaf," "healthy," "wellness," and "ball stopped") are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information to help answer the question.
The sentence mentions "a vehicle on rails," which indicates that the location is likely related to trains or rail transportation. The specific activity of reading magazines while waiting further suggests a place where people wait for trains, such as a train station. The other options, such as vegetables or a doctor's office, do not have any connection to rail transportation or waiting for a vehicle on rails.
The question is asking about a common skin condition that affects the feet, specifically the heels. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence mentions being near the coast, which suggests that seafood is likely readily available. The phrase "relieve your hunger" implies a need for sustenance, which can be satisfied by eating fish. The other options either do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are less likely to be available near the coast.
Electrical connections are typically found in walls, as wires are run through the walls to connect outlets and switches. The other options have no connection to electrical connections or the context of the sentence.
The phrase "silver screen" is commonly used to refer to the medium of movies, which were originally shown on a screen made of silver. This phrase is rarely used to describe other types of performances, such as plays, theater productions, or television shows. Therefore, the correct answer is "movies."
The sentence suggests that the person had an index card that they needed to return, which is a common item found in libraries' card catalogues. The purpose of a card catalog is to help library patrons find and locate specific books, so it is logical that the index card would have been returned to the card catalogue once the person found the book they needed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shelf is unstable, which indicates that it may be leaning or wobbling. The carpenter would need to identify which part of the shelf is causing the instability and fix that component. Given that the sentence specified "corner", it is likely that this is the area of the shelf that requires attention to stabilize it. None of the other options provided are directly related to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that Jan went to an actual theater to listen to a speech. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context and therefore are not likely answers to the question.
The sentence implies that there is a monster that the beauty loves, and the word "nickname" suggests that the monster is commonly referred to by a certain name. The word "beauty" may be a reference to the fairytale "Beauty and the Beast," in which the protagonist falls in love with a beast. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "beast." The other options (ugly, ugliness, satellite, top of mountain) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the coffee mug has been washed and dried, indicating that it is ready to be put away. The most logical place to put a dry mug would be on a shelf, as this is a common storage location for cups and other dishes. The other options, such as "desktop" or "kitchen," do not provide a clear indication of where the mug should be placed in relation to other objects or surfaces.
The question is asking where all participants are likely to need sports equipment, which suggests that the context is related to sports. Dicks Sporting Goods and Sears are both stores that sell sporting equipment, but mall does not specifically indicate any stores that sell sports equipment. Sporting event could be a possible answer, but it does not necessarily mean that all participants will need sports equipment as some may just be spectators. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a sporting goods store, which is a location dedicated to selling sports equipment for all participants.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker needed to go to a place to purchase canned food items to contribute to a food drive. The grocery store is the most logical choice as it is a location where one can purchase a variety of canned food items. The other options, such as a shelf or cupboard, suggest locations within one's own home where canned goods might be stored, but not purchased. The cellar and refrigerator may contain canned goods, but not to the extent that a grocery store would.
In London, telephone booths are famously painted red, while in other places like the United States, they are often gray or in other colors. This is a distinct feature of London's landscape and culture that sets it apart from other cities. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Since John is in a wheelchair, he would not be able to use the stairs to reach the third floor. The other options, such as the space shuttle and downtown, are not applicable to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be the elevator, which is typically used for vertical transportation in multi-story buildings and would be accessible for someone in a wheelchair.
The context suggests that the mother is wrapping gifts in preparation for Christmas. The most common place to put wrapped gifts during the holiday season is under a Christmas tree. The other options, such as department store or specialty store, do not make sense in relation to the mother wrapping gifts. A Frazier fir is a type of Christmas tree, but it does not fit logically in this sentence. A Christmas stocking is typically hung up and not used to store wrapped gifts.
The sentence suggests that the wheel was loose and in danger of falling off when something specific was happening. The word "fast" indicates that the wheel was in danger of falling off when going quickly, implying that the object it was attached to was in motion. The other options do not provide any clarity on what action caused the wheel to become loose.
The question suggests that the person in question is causing harm without intending to, which would likely lead to feelings of remorse or regret. Empowering and glee are unlikely emotions in this context, while despair and sadness may be too extreme for someone who is simply unable to stop unintentionally causing harm.
The sentence suggests that someone's mail has been stolen, and specifically mentions letters that had been delivered. The most likely location for this to occur is a mail box, where letters are often left for delivery. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the physical contact between the man and woman resulted in a physiological response, which is typically associated with sexual arousal. The option "erections" is the most likely physiological result in this context, while the other choices are not relevant or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the teams were equally skilled and competitive, which creates an expectation among spectators about who will emerge victorious. Spectators are likely interested in whether one team will win or both will end in a draw, which is why winning or losing is the correct answer. Envy and resentment do not relate to the context of the sentence, while one winner and two winners do not make sense since there are only two teams competing.
The capitalization of "House" suggests that it is a proper noun and likely refers to a specific institution or group. The mention of Sally being a senior indicates that this institution or group has some sort of hierarchical structure, which is commonly found in high schools and colleges. The other options - assisted living facility, old people's home, and republican party - do not fit the context of a senior in the House. "Organization" could potentially fit, but it is too vague without additional context.
Skyscrapers are tall buildings that typically have many floors and are designed to accommodate a large number of offices. New York is known for its skyline of skyscrapers, many of which house a variety of businesses and offices. The other options (school building, grocery store) are unlikely locations for offices, and "work" and "business" are too general to provide a clear answer.
The sentence suggests that the speaker was originally going to stay in a small cabin, and that they were then upgraded to something larger or more luxurious. The options "spacecraft," "hall," and "palace" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are all significantly larger than a cabin. "Hotel" could be a possibility, but "villa" is a more likely choice given that it suggests a higher level of luxury and comfort than a typical hotel room.
The sentence states that Johnny is looking for blowfish in places that aren't near America. Therefore, we can eliminate Gulf of Mexico and Hawaiian waters as they are located in or near America. The other options remain, but tropical sea is too vague a description and could refer to multiple locations. Therefore, the best answer is South Pacific Ocean, which is a specific location known for its diverse marine life, including blowfish.
The question specifies that John is traveling on a highway heading South from Texas without stopping. Since Mexico is located to the South of Texas, it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as developed land, desert, United States, and Oklahoma do not provide information that would lead to a logical conclusion as to where John will end up.
The sentence implies that the person did not expect the idea to become reality, indicating that they did not think it would happen. The word "finally" suggests that they had been working towards this idea for some time, and it was unexpected for it to come to fruition. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a projector and a huge screen, which are commonly associated with showing movies. Additionally, the fact that the audience is laughing suggests that they are likely watching something entertaining, which is another characteristic commonly associated with movies. The other options, such as theatre or conference, do not necessarily imply that the audience would be laughing or that a projector and screen would be present.
The sentence suggests that the item in question was once considered cutting edge technology, and that people now use "smart" versions of it. This is a common way of referring to the development of technology over time. The options "mobile phone," "briefcase," "office," and "desktop" are all more modern inventions and do not fit the historical context suggested by the sentence. A calculator that fits on a wristwatch, however, was a major technological breakthrough when it was first introduced.
Taking a shower after exercise, such as running, can help you feel refreshed and rejuvenated. It can also help to cool your body down and reduce sweating. The other options, such as becoming tired or experiencing leg cramps, are not typical outcomes of taking a shower after exercise.
The sentence implies that the negative effect being referred to is not related to the spouses themselves, but rather to someone else impacted by the divorce. The options "no spouse" and "lose money" may be negative consequences for one of the spouses, but not for someone else. "Lot of grief" and "depression" could be experienced by anyone involved in the divorce, not just someone other than a spouse. Therefore, the option "children suffer" is most likely the correct answer as children are often deeply affected by their parents' divorce, both emotionally and in other ways such as their living arrangements and financial stability.
The question mentions a tower that is used to transmit signals. This is a common feature of radio stations, as they need to broadcast their signals over a large area. The other options are not likely to have towers specifically for signal transmission, and are not directly related to the context of the question.
The sentence states that the friend lives close to you, which implies that meeting up should also be in a nearby location. Among the choices, the neighbor's house is the most likely option as they live close by. The other options are unlikely to be the correct answer because they do not provide a clear indication of a nearby location.
The sentence suggests that regardless of a person's background, they deserve to be treated equally when applying for a job. This means that the hiring process should be fair and unbiased so that everyone has an equal chance of being hired based on their qualifications and skills. The other options, such as critical thinking, congratulated, compliments, and raffle tickets, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not provide any useful information in answering the question.
The sentence suggests that James is likely in a location where he would have access to a desk or workspace, such as a home or office. A desk drawer would be a logical place to store a pencil sharpener in this context. The other options do not have a clear association with storing office supplies. A cabinet could be used to store a variety of items, a library would not typically have office supplies, a nightstand is typically used for personal items, and a stationery store would require James to leave his current location to find a sharpener.
The sentence suggests that the crab was having difficulty moving and was "strained." This could be due to an obstacle in its path, such as sand, which could impede its movement. Tide pools, current, and cooking pots do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be obstacles in the crab's path.
A pantry is a specific type of storage space typically used for storing food items, including dishes. In many homes, pantries are located near the kitchen and are designed to keep dishes organized and easily accessible. On the other hand, shelves can be used to store both dishes and books, as can a living room, table, or apartment depending on the individual's preferences and living arrangements.
The sentence suggests that grooming may sometimes take longer than expected. In such a case, the next appointment may be delayed, indicating that the correct answer is "late." The other options, such as "injury," "beauty," "mistakes," and "annoyed," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that James is interested in outer space and specifically mentions that he loves the idea of going to Mars. This suggests that James is interested in space travel and would ideally want to reach Mars on a spacecraft. The other options, such as love, zoo, school, and library, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The other choices do not fit the concept of putting something in a container. A cargo ship is a vessel for transporting large quantities of goods, and a port is a location for ships to dock. A refrigerator is used for storing food, but it is not a container. A closet and garage are spaces to store items, but not necessarily in a container. Therefore, the correct answer is food, as it is something that can be placed in a container for transport or storage.
The sentence suggests that parents yell when there is chaos to exert control over their children's behavior. Yelling may be a way for parents to assert authority and get their children to follow directions, especially in situations where there is a lot of noise or activity. The other options do not match the context of the sentence as well – guiding, understanding, caring for, or venting anger are not necessarily associated with yelling in times of chaos.
The sentence mentions needing a coat if it is cold, which suggests that the location is outdoors. Among the options, a bus stop is an outdoor location where people often stand in line and may need a coat in cold weather. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James was searching for a place to buy bitcoins, which is typically done through online exchanges or websites. The other options, such as a bar or cafe, do not make sense in this context as they are not commonly associated with buying and selling digital currency.
Casinos have strict rules and regulations when it comes to gambling. Counting cards is considered cheating and is illegal in many casinos. This practice involves keeping track of the cards that have been dealt, enabling the player to better predict which cards will be dealt next. This increases the player's chances of winning and is seen as an unfair advantage against the house. Remembering, helping, winning, and dealing are not necessarily illegal, depending on the circumstances and rules of the particular game.
Strip malls often contain a variety of shops and businesses, including beauty salons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Parks are often public spaces where people gather and spend time, making them a common location for trash cans. Additionally, parks usually have designated areas for waste disposal in order to keep the space clean and enjoyable for everyone. The other options may have trash cans, but parks are the most likely choice based on the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the notepad is small enough to be stored on your person, which rules out options such as home and school. The word "meeting" could potentially suggest a briefcase or bag, but there is no clear indication that the notepad needs to be taken to a meeting specifically. The phrase "on your person" implies that the notepad needs to be easily accessible, which makes the back pocket a logical choice. The drug store has no relevance to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that judging pigs is a process that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Evaluating is a more appropriate term in this context because it implies a comprehensive assessment of the pigs' qualities and characteristics. Verdict suggests a final decision, but judging is an ongoing process. Responsibility is not specific enough to the context of the sentence, and prejudice implies a biased perspective, which would not be appropriate in a fair judging competition.
Civil actions are typically initiated by individuals who feel wronged and seek justice or compensation. Anger is a common emotion that may motivate someone to take legal action, as they may feel that their rights have been violated or they have suffered some form of injustice. Complications and tiredness do not typically lead to civil action, and trial and court case are more specific steps within the legal process rather than emotions or motivations.
The sentence suggests that John is opposed to animal abuse and loves animals, which could make him hesitant to go to a pet store. Pet stores have been criticized for mistreating animals, so John may avoid visiting them to avoid supporting this kind of abuse. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Reading a newspaper is usually considered a way to stay informed about local and global events, and to gain knowledge about various topics. The phrase "gives you" suggests that the correct answer should indicate a positive outcome (i.e. gaining something), rather than a negative one (i.e. getting angry). "Education" is the most appropriate choice, as it implies that reading a newspaper can broaden your understanding of current events and increase your knowledge of the world around you. "Concern" and "worrie" are similar in meaning, both indicating a feeling of worry or unease, but they do not accurately reflect the positive benefits of reading a newspaper. "Learning about world" is also a possible choice, but it is more general and less specific to the question of local current events.
The sentence suggests that the lady was doing a one man show, which means she was performing alone. When a performer takes center stage, it means they move to the main area where all attention is focused on them, typically the middle of the stage. This is a common phrase used in theater and performance to indicate that the performer is starting their performance. The other options do not make sense in this context - "persuade", "challenge", and "speak clearly" suggest actions during a performance, but not necessarily at the beginning, while "slept" is clearly an incorrect option.
Fishing rods are equipment used for fishing and are commonly sold in sporting goods stores. Furniture stores do not typically sell fishing equipment, nor do hardware stores, which specialize in hardware and construction tools. While a fishing camp may sell fishing rods, it is not a common place for consumers to purchase them. Engines do not have any relation to fishing equipment.
The sentence suggests that if Ali bumps into the speaker while they are walking, they should do something specific. The correct answer is "slow down" because if someone bumps into you while walking, it's likely because they need to slow down and watch where they're going. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person is watching TV to pass their time and find something to occupy themselves, which is typically associated with seeking entertainment. The other options (erections, boredom, getting fat, sadness) do not seem to be appropriate options for what someone might expect to get from watching TV in this context.
The question is asking where you would store a shopping bag if all the seats in your vehicle are full, which suggests that you are transporting the shopping bag in your vehicle. The car trunk is a common storage area for items in a vehicle and is designed for keeping items secure and out of sight. The other options, such as the roof or a retail store, are not relevant to the context of the question.
The sentence specifically mentions a temple, which is typically associated with religious sites. Jerusalem is known as a holy city for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and has a rich history of religious architecture, including the Temple Mount. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "passenger" implies that the question refers to people who are traveling in an airplane, rather than pilots or crew members who might be flying or landing the plane. The sentence also mentions that people are waiting to use electronics, which suggests that they have already boarded the plane. Reading is a common activity for people to do on planes, especially during takeoff and landing when electronic devices have to be turned off. Buying tickets is also not relevant to the question, as that is done before boarding the plane.
The sentence suggests that someone who has attended school for twelve years is expected to do something specific afterwards. One possible outcome is to "graduate," which means to receive a diploma or certificate of completion after finishing a program of study. The other options, such as "inspiration," "much work," and "boredom," do not make sense in this context and are unlikely to be the correct answer. "Degree" is a related term, but it does not necessarily imply that someone has completed a program of study and may not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is yelling after getting a bruise, which indicates a physical sensation. The options "self pity," "communication," and "embarrassment" do not directly relate to physical pain. "Understood" may suggest that the person's pain is being acknowledged, but it is not a clear answer on its own. Therefore, "pain" is the most fitting option.
The word "helm" is related to steering or controlling a vessel. The fact that the sentence mentions the helm moving the masts suggests that it is a device used on sailing vessels, which use masts to power their movement. The other options may not have masts or may use alternative methods of propulsion that do not involve masts, making them less likely choices.
The question is asking for a location to store a wind instrument in your home. The most logical answer would be a room dedicated to music, such as a music room, as it would likely have proper storage and conditions for musical instruments. The other options, such as under a bed or at a symphony, do not make sense in the context of the question. The option for a music store also doesn't make sense as the question is asking for a location in your home, not a store outside of your home.
The sentence suggests that someone delivers the morning paper to your home, which is a common practice for newspapers. The choices are all different locations, but only the front porch is a place where someone would typically deliver a newspaper to your home. The other options, such as a classroom, synagogue, bathroom or grocery store, do not have any connection to receiving a newspaper delivery.
Speech therapists work with individuals to improve their ability to communicate effectively. This can involve working on a wide range of skills, such as articulation, fluency, and language development. The option "complete sentences" is the most closely related to this definition, as forming complete sentences is a fundamental aspect of effective communication. The other options do not have any clear connection to the role of a speech therapist.
The sentence suggests that the reason John disliked mosquitoes is not because they suck blood, but because they make a particular noise. Mosquitoes are known for their high-pitched buzzing sound, which is often associated with irritation and annoyance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person curled up under a blanket to get warm, which is a common behavior when someone is feeling chilly. The addition of "feel more comfortable" implies that the action of curling up under the blanket accomplished its goal of making the person feel more at ease. The other options (sleep, sweating, blush, cuddle) do not match the context of the sentence as well.
The sentence mentions that the blowfish was found off the coast of the Carolina's, which are located near the Atlantic Ocean. The other options do not have any connection to the location mentioned in the sentence. Additionally, blowfish are commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean, which further supports the answer choice.
The sentence suggests that the person was doing favors for their coworkers and was frustrated that they were not receiving anything in return. The word "gratitude" is the most fitting option as it refers to the feeling of being grateful for someone's actions. The other options do not directly match the context of the sentence. "Let down" and "disappointment" would be more suitable if the person had expectations that were not met. "Respect" would be more appropriate if the person was looking for recognition, and "illness" and "satisfaction" do not fit the context.
The sentence suggests that the family was playing cards for leisure or enjoyment. The use of the word "playing" suggests that the activity was not a serious one, and the absence of any mention of gambling or money indicates that the family was not playing to win or lose anything. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "having fun".
The verb "moving" indicates that cars are in motion, which typically involves someone driving the car. The other options, such as "road," "getting tired," "accidents," and "ticket," may be related to the concept of driving, but they do not fully capture the action of moving cars.
A rural area generally refers to a region that is characterized by a low population density, with most people residing in small communities or villages. Therefore, it is more likely for a large village to be located in a rural area rather than a big city, suburbs, or a specific state like Ohio. The term countryside also refers to a rural area, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of a large village.
The sentence suggests that the business has a requirement for people entering their store. One common requirement for most stores is that customers must wear shoes for hygiene and safety reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to a store's requirements.

A binder containing homework assignments is typically owned and carried by a student, who would most likely keep it in their backpack. The other options do not fit the context of the question as well. A bookcase is where books are kept, not typically school supplies. An office supply store may sell binders, but it would not be the location of the actual binder containing the homework assignments. An office or classroom may have a binder containing assignments, but it would not be the most common location for a student to find their own binder.
The description of Shane's behavior as "ridiculous" and "cheerful" suggests that it was not appropriate for the somber and serious occasion of a funeral. The word "somber" means serious and solemn, which is more in line with what people typically expect at a funeral. The other options do not fit with the context of a funeral or the tone conveyed in the sentence.
The sentence implies that the college kids were lacking in design aesthetic when it came to decorating their living space. The fact that they used a folding chair inside their room suggests that they may not have had enough furniture or were using makeshift items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence provides geographic information that the department store is located in the Northwest USA. New York and big city are not in the Northwest region, while town and shopping mall are not specific enough to determine a location. Idaho is a state in the Northwest region, so it is the best choice.
Blinking lights in the air at night are typically associated with airplanes. Planes use flashing lights to communicate their position and help prevent collisions. The other options do not make sense in the context of blinking lights in the air at night.
The sentence suggests that the monkey is being used for scientific research, which is commonly conducted in research laboratories. The people wearing white coats also support this idea, as scientists often wear lab coats in a research setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person wants to put a table in their house, which implies that they need an indoor space for it. Libraries and demonstrations are public spaces that are unlikely to have furniture like a table, while a football ground is an outdoor space. A rug is also not a suitable option as it is a floor covering, not a container for a table. A corner of a room, however, is a common location to place a table, making it the most likely answer.
Animals engage in a variety of behaviors that John may be interested in studying, but observing them bathing is a common and important behavior to track. Bathing can help animals maintain their hygiene, regulate their body temperature, and even reduce stress. The other options either do not relate to observable behaviors or are less commonly studied in animal behavior research.
The sentence suggests that Sarah believed she had been at home all evening, implying that she did not leave during that time. Therefore, the only time for her to have left would have been after evening, which is the night. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they occur prior to the evening or are too similar to evening (i.e., daytime).
The sentence implies that the location where the tool is kept is downstairs, which eliminates the options of hardware store, garage, repair shop, and the library. The only remaining option is the basement, which is commonly located below ground level in a house or building.
Potatoes are a common ingredient used in stews, and they are typically stored in a cool, dry place like a pantry. The other options (restaurants, casserole, root cellar, pockets) do not make sense in this context.
The word "only some" suggests that not all types of police carry weapons. In many countries, only certain specialized units or officers with specific responsibilities, such as detectives or SWAT team members, are authorized to carry firearms. The other options, such as directing traffic or helping people, could apply to a wider range of police officers.
The sentence suggests that the grandpa does not know how to read, which is commonly referred to as being illiterate. The child wants to teach his grandpa to read because he believes it is wrong for someone to go through life without this basic skill. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The word "traditionally" suggests that the answer is something that has been used for a long time to gather information about the world. While books and television are also common sources of information, newspapers have a long history of being a primary source for daily news updates. Meetings and guides may provide information, but they are not typically sources for general knowledge about the world.
The sentence suggests that the temperature is increasing rapidly because the sun is out. "Heat up" is the only choice that accurately reflects this idea. "Cool down" and "drop to zero" are contradictory to the sentence, while "dropping quickly" and "increase" are too vague and don't accurately capture the idea of the temperature rising rapidly.
The sentence suggests that the person doesn't like the smell of something, and would rather spray themselves with water than be near it. The only option that fits this context is perfume, as it is a scented product that could potentially be disliked by someone. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Competence in school work typically refers to a student's ability to meet the academic expectations of their classes, which includes achieving passing grades. While compliments and intellectual challenges could potentially be received by a competent student, they are not necessarily guaranteed or directly related to competence. Stickers may be given as a reward system in some classrooms, but they are not a direct result of academic competence. Avoiding pain is not related to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that lizards need the sun's heat to regulate their body temperature, which is why they will be found on a specific object. Rocks are a common object that lizards will lay on to bask in the sun and absorb its heat. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the man is looking for deodorant, which is typically stored in a bathroom or medicine cabinet. The wife's response indicates that she expects the deodorant to be in a specific location, so the medicine chest is the most likely choice. The other options are less likely because they either do not relate to where deodorant is typically stored or because they do not provide enough information to make an informed choice.
The question asks what a person can do to get good grades, which implies that the person needs to take some action to achieve their goal. The option "try to learn" is the most logical answer because it suggests that the person needs to put in effort and work hard to understand and master the material they are studying. The other options are not as relevant or helpful in improving one's academic performance.
The sentence suggests that there is not enough seating for everyone, which implies that a group of people will not be able to comfortably sit together. Of the given options, a meeting is the most likely event that would require seating for a group of people. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Shadows are created when an object blocks the path of light, causing a darker area to appear behind it. Since the ground is the most common surface that objects are placed on, it is also the most common place where shadows appear. The other options might also create shadows, but they are less likely to be the first place someone thinks of when considering where shadows are typically seen.
The sentence suggests that when we receive something and feel grateful, we typically express our gratitude in a certain way. "Show appreciation" is the option that best matches this idea. Saying "thank you" is a common way of showing appreciation, but it is not one of the options given. Smiling and looking for more are not necessarily actions associated with expressing gratitude, so they can be ruled out.
The question is asking about activities that can occur in the mind while sleeping. Dreams are commonly associated with the sleeping mind, which is supported by the phrase "might dream" in the answers. Snoring and talking are physical actions that can occur during sleep, but the question is specifically asking about mental activities. Getting cold is a physical sensation and not related to the mind. "Nothing" is too vague and does not provide any useful information to help answer the question.
In grammar, a conjunction is a part of speech that connects words or groups of words together. Therefore, when combining two words, a conjunction is the appropriate preposition to use, such as "and," "or," or "but." The other options (article, adjective, interjection, pronoun) do not serve this purpose.
The sentence suggests that George intentionally, or "knowingly," ruined the surprise. The other options do not imply intentionality, which is necessary to match the context of the sentence. Hiding, accidentally, and expectation all suggest that George may have stumbled into ruining the surprise. Planned, while it does suggest intentionality, does not match the tense of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that to create a positive change in society, one must start from within themselves. This is often associated with the idea of self-improvement, personal growth, and making changes to oneself before trying to make changes in the world. The other options listed do not necessarily relate to this idea, and in some cases may even have a negative effect on creating positive change. For example, riots are usually associated with violence and destruction and may not result in any positive change or solutions.
The use of the term "heifer" suggests that we are talking about a female cow that has not yet given birth. New Hampshire is known for its dairy industry, so taking a heifer there would likely lead to a dairy farm or farm field. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking for the most likely place within your home to store birth control pills, and the option "medicine cabinet" is the most logical choice. Medicine cabinets are typically used for storing medications and other healthcare products, making them a convenient and easily accessible location for birth control pills. The other options, such as "chemist's shop" and "drug store," are external locations that would not typically be found in a person's home.
Fish are aquatic animals and thus spend the majority of their time in bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, rivers and streams. Out of the given options, only 'body of water' and 'underwater' are related to the habitat of fish. 'Lake Superior' is a specific body of water, but not all fish live in Lake Superior, so it is not the correct answer. 'Toilet' is not a natural body of water, while 'aquarium' is a man-made enclosure where fish are kept in captivity.
The sentence suggests that the act of jogging all day can have negative consequences on your feet. Blisters are a common ailment associated with prolonged physical activity, especially when wearing ill-fitting footwear or not using adequate protection. The other options do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that the sugary beverage being referred to contains water as one of its key ingredients. Mountain dew, glass, whirlpool bath, and coffee cup are not drinks and do not fit the context of the question. "Soft drink" is a common term for carbonated, sugary beverages that are typically made with water and other ingredients such as corn syrup and flavorings.
Schools are commonly located in residential neighborhoods, as they serve the local community and are often within walking distance of students' homes. Mosques are religious centers, not necessarily educational ones. While schools are found in many cities, the sentence suggests a specific type of location. Prague is a city, but the sentence does not provide any information about schools in Prague specifically. "Community" is too vague and could refer to any type of location.
The sentence suggests that the woman enjoyed having her friends over to her home on Fridays. This is indicated by the phrase "open invitation" and the fact that she "loved to host." The correct answer is therefore likely to relate to hosting or entertaining guests, which is represented by the option "entertain." The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the context is about the institution where slaves did labor work in the South, thus the correct answer is plantation. Plantation is commonly associated with the history of slavery in the Southern United States, where slaves were forced to work in large farms owned by wealthy landowners. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions "papers for work or school," which suggests that the answer is an item commonly used in academic or professional settings. "Street," "obesity," and "living room" do not have any clear connection to storing papers. "Office suite" might be a valid answer, but it refers to a grouping of rooms rather than a specific item used for organizing papers, making "binder" the most likely choice.
A notebook is a common item found in bookstores as they typically carry school and office supplies. Backpacks are a type of bag, not a place to purchase a notebook. Abraham Lincoln's grave is a historical landmark and not a place to purchase a notebook either. Desktops are computers and not a place to purchase a physical notebook. Classrooms may have notebooks available for purchase, but they are not the primary location for purchasing them.
The sentence suggests that the monkey was performing in a circus, which is commonly associated with zoos, where animals are trained to perform for entertainment. The conductor's comment also further supports the idea that the monkey was in a zoo setting, as he jokes about the monkey's "work" there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question implies that owning something increases the likelihood of encountering spiders. A shed, which is an outdoor storage structure, is more likely to have spiders than a meadow or a cupboard. A mail box and a cellar are typically indoors, and are less likely to have spiders.
The word "captive" suggests that the monkey is in some form of captivity or captivity-like setting, which typically refers to places such as zoological gardens or wildlife reserves. Rain forests and tree tops are natural habitats for monkeys and they would not be considered captive in these locations. Toy stores and the great outdoors are also unlikely places to find captive monkeys.
The sentence suggests that driving too fast on an icy road is a negative behavior that could lead to harmful consequences. The word "dangerous" is the best fit as it directly relates to the consequences of the behavior described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior or its potential consequences.
The context of the sentence implies that someone is discussing the idea that ignorance cannot be used as a defense for committing a crime. In this context, the word "judge" makes the most sense as they are the individual who would be responsible for determining whether ignorance is a valid excuse in a court of law. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Learn about subject" and "learn new" are both related to acquiring knowledge, but they do not specifically relate to the legal concept of ignorance as a defense. "Find truth" suggests a search for information, but it does not necessarily relate to the concept of ignorance in the legal context. "Is bliss" is a common phrase that implies that not knowing something may be better than knowing it, but it does not relate to the context of the sentence.
A yard is a unit of measurement that typically refers to three feet. This is a commonly-known measurement and is the most logical answer among the options given. The other options do not relate to the context of the question, which is asking about what comprises a yard.
The word "outgoing" is commonly used to describe someone who is sociable, extroverted, and enjoys being around people. People who are outgoing tend to seek out new experiences and social opportunities because they enjoy interacting with others. Playfulness may also be a characteristic of an outgoing person, but it is not as strongly associated with the term as seeking new experiences. "Own house", "good looking", and "beautiful" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The verb "dissipate" means to gradually disappear or be used up. Therefore, it makes sense that this would be the correct answer to the question, as money tends to be used up and eventually disappear. The other answer choices, such as "flown," "disintegrate," and "fall apart," do not accurately describe what happens to money after it is used up. "Penultimate" is irrelevant to the question, as it refers to something second-to-last, which does not relate to what happens to money.
Fort Knox is a military base in Kentucky that is famously known for housing the United States Bullion Depository, which stores a significant portion of the nation's gold reserves. The other answer choices do not have any connection to gold reserves or the U.S. government.
The keyword in the question is "primary duty," which suggests that the answer will be related to the most important responsibility of a parent. The other options may be important as well, but they do not necessarily represent the primary duty of a parent. "Care for children" is a common phrase that encompasses a wide range of responsibilities, including providing for their physical needs, ensuring their safety, nurturing their emotional development, and supporting their education. The other options, such as "speak freely" or "control children," do not accurately reflect the primary role of a parent.
The question implies that the audience is particularly loud and enthusiastic at a certain type of event. This is a common characteristic of sports games, especially those with high levels of physical activity, such as hockey. Show, theatre, movies and event don't typically involve the same level of vocal participation from the audience, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence describes a location where one can find both food options and a variety of stores. A shopping center typically contains a food court or restaurants, as well as a range of shops selling various goods. The other options do not necessarily offer both food and shopping options in one place, except for a downtown area which might have many different stores and restaurants but is not as specific as a shopping center.
The sentence suggests that there might be a problem with the electrical connection, and the word "wires" is most closely associated with electrical connections. The other options - company, telephone network, airport, and freeway - do not have any clear relevance to electrical equipment.
The sentence suggests that children may become confused while walking home and end up at the wrong location. The option "wrong house" is a logical choice as it directly relates to the situation described in the sentence. The other options have no clear relevance to the situation of children getting lost while walking home.
The word "seeks" indicates that the government is actively trying to obtain something from its people. The options "country", "city", and "sun" do not make sense in the context of a government seeking something over its people. "Trouble" may be a possibility, but it is not commonly associated with a government's relationship with its citizens. "Control", on the other hand, is a frequently used term to describe the power that a government exercises over its people.
The context of the sentence implies that the reason for reading the letter is to obtain news or information from a friend who is overseas. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the canned food is being stored in the kitchen, and specifically above the sink. The most logical choice for storage in this context would be a cupboard, which is a type of cabinet that is commonly found in kitchens and used to store various items, including non-perishable food. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as an oven is used for cooking, a grocery store is a place to purchase food, a pantry is a separate room or designated storage area, and a cellar is typically used for storing wine or other perishable goods.
The sentence is discussing a graveyard, which is typically referred to as a cemetery. The options "Arlington" and "church property" imply specific locations, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest those locations are relevant. "Out back" and "every town" are too vague to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the people were looking for a scenic route, which indicates that they wanted to enjoy natural beauty. The option "countryside" is more likely to offer such views, as it typically refers to rural areas with open fields, farms, and natural landscapes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and some of them (like "developed land" or "atlas") might even suggest the opposite of scenic beauty.
The sentence suggests that the performer is entertaining friends at a casual setting, which is commonly associated with a social gathering or party. The other options, such as cinema, opera, stage or dance, are typically more formal settings where performers are hired to put on a show for an audience.
The term "motorway" is commonly used in England to refer to a high-speed road designed for motor vehicles only, similar to what is known as a freeway or expressway in other parts of the world. Scotland is part of the UK but has its own distinct road network terminology, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Europe is a broad region with many different countries and road systems. A race track is not a type of public road. While New Jersey has highways, the term "motorway" is not commonly used in the US.
The opposite of hosting a crowd would be having just one person, or a single person, in attendance. The other options do not relate to the concept of hosting or being social in any way, and are therefore not viable answer choices for this question.
The sentence suggests that the person is applying for a job, which implies that they are seeking "employment." "Work" and "income" are related concepts, but they do not specifically refer to the act of seeking a job. "Hope" and "offer" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The phrase "called bull" is often used to mean calling out a lie or falsehood. In this context, the friend made a claim about bulls that the person didn't believe to be true. The phrase "bullbleep" is a slang term that means nonsense or foolishness, which fits with the idea that the person didn't believe their friend's claim. The other options do not fit with the context or meaning of the sentence.
Compassionate and thoughtful are both adjectives that are often associated with kindness and empathy towards others. Therefore, it can be inferred that compassionate thoughtful behavior would be described as kind. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that fighting inflation is important because if it is not successful, something negative could happen. The term "inflation" refers to a general increase in prices and a decrease in the purchasing value of money. If inflation is not controlled or reduced, it can lead to economic instability, which can manifest as things like recessions, high unemployment rates, and decreased economic growth. The other options, such as "not noticeable" and "eat cake," do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the group is at an amusement park and took a break to have lunch. While eating, they discussed their plans for the next ride. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they were talking about having fun on the next ride. The other options, such as heartburn, gas, and food poisoning, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be what the group was discussing.
The sentence states that James drove his niece to her father, which implies that the father is James' brother. Therefore, the correct answer is brother's house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not match the relationship between James and his niece's father.
The sentence suggests that the teachers are preparing their classrooms, which often involves unpacking and setting up materials. Therefore, the most relevant answer choice is "open boxes." The other options do not relate to the task of setting up a classroom, such as "talking too much" or "teaching children," which are part of a teacher's regular duties. "Answering questions" and "giving homework" may also be tasks teachers do, but they don't relate directly to preparing a classroom.
The first part of the sentence says "We do not have rest," which implies that the people are not getting any breaks or time to relax. This would likely lead to feelings of exhaustion or fatigue. The other options, such as feeling lonely or feeling better, do not relate as directly to the lack of rest mentioned in the sentence.
Fast food restaurants are known for providing quick and convenient food options that can be purchased and eaten at tables within the establishment. The other options listed do not typically provide food and tables for customers to eat at. Houses are typically private residences where people live, not places of business. Libraries and conferences are places for learning and networking, respectively, and do not typically provide food and tables for customers. Paper is a material used for writing and printing, not a location for eating.
Bookstores typically sell books and other reading materials, including magazines. Carpeting and applesauce are not typically sold in bookstores, and a strip mall or city is not a specific product that can be purchased in a store.
The sentence suggests that the act of socializing by engaging in trivial conversations has a specific name. "Small talk" is a commonly used phrase to describe this kind of conversation that is meant to be light and casual, rather than deep or meaningful. The other options either do not relate to the act of engaging in small talk or are too broad in their scope to accurately describe this particular behavior.
The sentence suggests that the kids had been having fun for an extended period of time, indicating that they may be tired and in need of rest. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence. A wild ride or massive bear would be unexpected and not indicated by the sentence, and playing marbles or constructing do not relate to the idea of needing rest.
The sentence suggests that Sarah made a mistake and ingested something that she thought was safe and meant for consumption. Given that the sentence mentions the word "cabinet," it is likely that the substance was stored alongside other household items, potentially including medication. The context implies that Sarah was intending to take medicine, and mistakenly ingested poison instead. The other options, such as junk food or nutrient, are not likely to have been stored in a cabinet and would therefore be less likely to be confused with medicine.
The sentence suggests that the sales tactics in some stores are designed to make women think they are getting a good deal, and one common tactic is to make it seem like buying more products will result in a greater discount or savings. Therefore, the correct answer is "save money." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Seeing new things often leads to a sense of excitement as it is a novel experience that can be thrilling and adventurous. Curiosity may also be felt, but it is more of a desire to learn and understand rather than an emotion. Boredom and fear are less likely to be associated with new experiences, while wonder can be a close second to excitement, but it often implies a sense of awe or amazement, rather than just the thrill of something new.
The sentence implies that a strong laxative can help regulate bowel movements. "Regular" is often used to describe healthy bowel movements that occur on a consistent basis. The other options are unrelated or contradictory to the context of the sentence.
A connection that allows someone to go to another place would most likely refer to a network connection, such as the internet, that allows someone to access resources located elsewhere. The other options, such as wires or a wall, do not have any clear connection to the idea of going to another place. Freeways may allow physical travel to another place, but they are not typically referred to as "connections."
The sentence suggests that God has a specific expectation or desire for people in regards to money, and the answer choice "work in life" aligns with the biblical idea of earning one's own living through labor (2 Thessalonians 3:10). The other choices do not relate to the context of God's view on money.
Lips are typically located on the lower and upper areas of the mouth. The other options - jars and all faces, Kentucky Fried Chicken, hand, and human - do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question is asking for a location where a pen can be carried while going through the day, which suggests a portable location. Options such as "office supply store," "friend's house," "desk drawer," and "city hall" do not seem appropriate for carrying a pen throughout the day. Conversely, a "pocket" is a common place to carry small objects such as pens, making it the most logical choice.
The question asks for a food item that goes well with potatoes, and the choices provided include two locations (Maryland and kitchen cupboard) and two types of meat (chicken and tuna). Based on the context of the question, it is likely that the correct answer is a type of meat. Chicken is a common white meat that pairs well with potatoes in many dishes, such as roasted chicken and mashed potatoes or chicken and potato casserole. Tuna, on the other hand, is not typically paired with potatoes in Western cuisine, and the two location options (Maryland and kitchen cupboard) do not provide any clear connection to the question.
The phrase "instituting civil action" suggests a legal process, and going to court is a common outcome of legal action. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the legal or judicial system.
The sentence suggests that hitting someone while driving could have serious consequences for that person. The option "deaths" reflects the severity of the situation and the potential danger that the person faces. This option is supported by statistics that show that car accidents can result in fatalities. The other options do not reflect the gravity of the situation and are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The word "chatting" suggests a casual conversation, which is often done for enjoyment or social reasons. The other options don't make sense in this context, as they don't explain why someone would chat during class specifically. "Necessity" might make sense if the conversation was related to the class material, but "answers" and "inspiration" are too specific and unlikely to be the sole reason for chatting. "Love" is also unlikely unless the context of the sentence suggests a romantic relationship.
Manufacturing operations involve the production of goods on a large scale, which is typically done in a dedicated facility called a factory. Schools, grocery stores, bands, and aircraft all have different functions and purposes that do not involve the mass production of goods.
The sentence indicates that the man didn't like stepping on cold tiles, which suggests that he put carpeting in a place where he frequently walks barefoot. The most logical option is the bedroom, where people often walk in and out of bed barefoot. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the liquid meal mentioned can be made more flavorful by adding pepper and salt. The options "supermarket," "cellars," and "grocery store" are locations and not applicable to the question's context. While water can be used to create a liquid meal, it is unlikely that it would benefit from pepper and salt, making it an unlikely answer. However, soup is a type of liquid meal that is commonly seasoned with pepper and salt to enhance its taste.
Shouting at someone across a room may be considered rude and inappropriate, while boarding a ship, crossing a street, or feeling happy have no connection to getting someone's attention. On the other hand, smiling is a friendly and non-threatening approach that can grab someone's attention and convey a positive attitude.
The question suggests that the dog in question is a stray, meaning it does not have an owner and has likely wandered away from its home. Animal shelters are known for taking in stray animals and providing them with care until they can either be reunited with their owner or adopted by a new family. The other options do not seem like logical places to find a stray dog, as a living room and a dog show would imply that the dog already has an owner, while georgia and pet shops do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The opera is a form of entertainment that is usually associated with relaxation and enjoyment. It often involves beautiful music and elaborate costumes and sets, which are designed to transport the audience to another time and place. While some people may find the opera boring or experience headaches from the loud music, the majority of people who attend the opera do so to experience a sense of relaxation and enjoyment.
The context suggests that people who love a vacation destination want to prolong their stay there. This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices, such as overspending and debt, do not logically follow from the initial statement. Additionally, the natural desire to want to remain in an enjoyable location for as long as possible supports the idea that people who love a vacation spot are more likely to want to stay there.
The sentence mentions that the card players were sitting emotionless, which is a common feature of poker games where players often try to hide their emotions in order to bluff their opponents. The sentence also suggests that the scene is taking place in an aquarium, which is not relevant to any of the other options. "Card shark" is a term used to refer to a skilled card player, but it does not give any information about the type of game being played in this sentence. "Sea world" and "shallow waters" do not have any clear relevance to the context. "Court room" may have been a possibility, but the mention of the shark swimming in the background suggests otherwise.
A drugstore is a place where medication and healthcare products are sold without a prescription. Contraceptive devices, such as condoms or spermicides, are included in these products and can be purchased without a prescription at a drugstore. While a pharmacy may also sell these products, they may require a prescription in some cases. A person or bedroom would not be appropriate places to purchase contraceptive devices, and McDonald's is not a location that sells healthcare products.
The question suggests that the desk is used by a young person, which would most likely be in a personal space such as a bedroom. While offices, schoolrooms, and libraries may have desks, they are typically used by a variety of people and not specifically young individuals. A gym would not typically have a desk at all.
The question is asking about a place where one can buy clothes, specifically socks and jeans. The option "washing machine" is incorrect as that is a household appliance used for cleaning clothes. "Laundromat" is where one goes to wash clothes but not to buy them. "Closet" is a storage space in one's home and not a place to purchase clothing. "Shopping mall" is an option that could work, but "clothing store" is a more specific and accurate answer as it is a type of store that specializes in selling clothes, including socks and jeans.
The sentence suggests that the farmer is compassionate and cares for the heifer's well-being, indicating that the heifer is not being sent to a place where it will be killed for its meat or dairy. A cattle ranch and dairy farm are places where cows and heifers are typically raised for their meat or milk, so they are unlikely options. A grocery store is a place where food is sold, not where animals live. A slaughterhouse is where animals are killed for their meat, so it is also an unlikely option. The countryside is a more plausible option, as it suggests an open space where the heifer can roam free during its last days.

The sentence suggests that the place people might go to celebrate would have rides, which is commonly associated with amusement parks such as Disneyland. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the shark was traveling long distances between continents, which would likely mean it was found in the open ocean. Biologists often track the movements of marine animals in the open ocean using satellite tracking or acoustic tags, so it is reasonable to assume that they found the shark in the open ocean. The other options do not make as much sense based on the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Lilly's deli is located in an area where there may be a significant Jewish population, as kosher food is specific to Jewish dietary laws. Therefore, it is likely that Lilly would live in or near a Jewish community. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the parking lot mentioned is associated with a place where people would likely carry shopping bags, which indicates that it is a shopping mall. The other options are not typically associated with carrying shopping bags, and therefore, do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the task of stopping being married was costly due to the high cost of lawyers and something else that was astronomical. The only choice that relates directly to the context is legal fees, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as free time, pleasure, or being lonely, do not have any clear connection to the sentence's context.
The phrase "chop up a grape" implies slicing or cutting up small pieces of fruit, which is commonly done when making a fruit cocktail. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - a fresh fruit typically does not need to be chopped up, a wine press is not used to chop fruit, a fruit basket is for presenting whole fruits, and a picnic basket could contain a variety of items, not necessarily chopped fruit.
The question is asking for a place that could have tens of thousands of fiddles, which is an unrealistic number for any of the other options. A music store, on the other hand, is a place where one could expect to find a large number of fiddles for sale, including rare and collectible models. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "ungulate" refers to a large mammal that has hooves, such as deer, elk or moose. The sentence suggests that James used a cannon to shoot at an animal while he was looking for lunch. The word "overkill" implies that his choice of weapon was excessive or unnecessary. Given this information, the most logical answer would be "ungulate" since it is a type of animal that is commonly hunted for food. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - for example, it is illegal to kill people or bombers with a cannon, and body armor does not typically require a cannon to penetrate.
The sentence suggests that James needs to work on his report before it is due tomorrow. The most likely place for him to do that work is in a space where he has access to resources like books, research materials, and a quiet place to work. The library is the most appropriate choice out of the given options, as it fits these criteria. The university and college class options are too broad, and the classroom option is not specific enough to indicate where James might work on his report.
The sentence suggests that the question is asking for a general location where one is likely to find many theaters. Populated areas are likely to have a higher concentration of theaters due to the availability of an audience and potential customers. Schools, military bases, and churches may have a theater but are not likely to have multiple theaters. An opera house may have a theater, but it is a specific type of theater and not the general location being asked for in the question.
The sentence suggests that the person's running escape was cut short because they tripped, indicating that the person may have neglected to tie their shoelace properly. Tying one's shoelace is a common safety measure when engaging in physical activity to prevent falls and accidents. The other options do not offer a logical explanation for why the person's escape was cut short.
Schools are often located in residential neighborhoods, as they need to be easily accessible to families with children. Community and building are too general, and Prague and every city are not relevant to the context of the question.
The question is asking which action would be appropriate to show appreciation for a compliment. The phrase "thank someone" suggests that gratitude is a key component of the answer. Options like "smile", "shake hands", and "say you're welcome" are polite responses, but do not directly address the issue of expressing gratitude. "Appreciate compliment" is a similar phrase to "thank someone", but it is not an action that can be taken, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the glass was broken from the inside of the car. Therefore, the broken glass would be found inside the car, not outside. This eliminates all of the options except for "inside the car." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about the consequences of not having enough food, and the phrase "not having enough food" commonly refers to a lack of sustenance that leads to malnutrition and eventual death if left unchecked. Eating fish or talking to each other are not necessarily relevant to the question and do not address the serious consequences of malnutrition. "They steal" may be a possible consequence of people not having enough food, but it is not as severe or certain as dying of starvation. Writing stories does not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The word "utensils" refers to tools used for eating, such as forks, knives, and spoons. The context of the sentence suggests that these tools are used during an evening activity, and the most common evening activity involving eating utensils is dinner. The other options (backpack, closet, drawer, cupboard) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Operations with numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, which is commonly taught through textbooks. Textbooks are written to provide a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts, including operations with numbers, and are designed to be used both in the classroom and for independent study. The other options, such as phonebooks, statistics or music schools, have no relevance to the subject of operations with numbers.
The sentence implies that the creatures being referred to are appreciated and cherished by a large number of people, which suggests that they have some positive or beneficial quality. The term "pollination" indicates that the creatures are likely insects or animals that help to transfer pollen from one flower to another, and butterflies are well-known for their role in pollination as well as their beauty and popularity among nature-lovers. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Avoiding eye contact is a common sign that someone may be lying. This is because the person may feel uncomfortable or nervous about lying and making direct eye contact can reveal their deception. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the friends enjoyed competing against each other, which implies that they viewed the competition as a positive activity. The word "work" suggests that there was a benefit or positive outcome associated with the competition. Given the positive connotation of the sentence, the best choice is "friendship" because it implies that the competition strengthened the bond between the friends. The other options have negative connotations that are not supported by the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that James enjoyed looking at the stars and that they illuminated something in the wilderness. The options "outer space," "universe," and "orbit" are all related to space, but they do not relate to the context of the sentence. "The ground" is also unlikely as stars do not typically illuminate the ground. "Night sky" is the most likely answer as it refers to the area of the sky that is visible at night and would be where James could observe the stars lighting up the darkness.
The sentence suggests that watching TV or playing with a cell phone is a routine activity, but it does not help in achieving a certain goal. The other options like "having TV", "falling asleep", "sitting", or "dancing" are not related to the idea of achieving a goal or acquiring new knowledge. Hence, the correct answer could be "learn" as watching TV or playing with a cell phone does not contribute to one's learning or knowledge acquisition.
The sentence suggests that only a selected few are able to turn their creativity into a profession. Creating art is a well-known career path for artists, painters, illustrators, and other kinds of creators who utilize their creativity to produce unique and aesthetically pleasing pieces of work. The other options may involve creativity, but they don't necessarily connote a profession. For example, sewing can just be a hobby for someone, whereas writing can be a profession for journalists, reporters or authors, but not necessarily a creative one.
The question asks for a type of water transportation that is human-powered, which means that it is powered solely by the physical effort of a person. The options "turn away," "let down," "have to sleep," and "run" do not have any clear connection to human-powered transportation. However, a row boat is commonly understood to be a type of watercraft that is propelled by oars, which are operated by a person's physical effort.
The question implies that the activity being described involves an auditory component that is not accessible to individuals who are deaf. Smiling, sweating, acting, and dancing can all be enjoyed by deaf individuals as they do not rely on the ability to hear. Singing, on the other hand, involves creating and hearing sound, which deaf individuals would not be able to enjoy.
The sentence suggests that the person in the line is feeling frustrated because the line is not moving. This feeling of frustration is commonly associated with anger, as the person may feel that their time is being wasted or that they are not being treated fairly. The other options, such as order or queueing up, do not accurately reflect the emotional state of the person in the situation described. Wait turn and fatigue may also be common emotions experienced when standing in line but are not the most appropriate choices based on the sentence structure.
The context of the sentence describes Bob putting on clothing and accessories commonly worn when swimming, such as waterproof trunks and goggles. This suggests that he is visiting a facility where swimming is taking place, and the most likely choice from the given options is a swimming pool. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about the actions customers take inside a store. The most common action that customers take is to purchase goods or services, which requires them to spend money. The other options may be actions that customers can take in certain situations, but they do not apply to the general experience of being inside a store.
The sentence suggests that the cubicles in the office serve a specific purpose related to the use of computers by employees. The most logical answer from the given choices would be "do work," as this implies that the computers in the cubicles are used for productivity and completing job-related tasks. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated or do not fit with the function of an office setting.
Dirt is a natural substance commonly found in gardens, so it would make sense to store dirt there. It is not practical or sanitary to store dirt in fingernails, a corner, or a computer. Storing dirt in a closet could also be problematic as it could potentially damage clothing or other items stored there.
The sentence suggests that the person is selling collector items, including a rare plate, which indicates that these items may have been purchased at a special place or event. A flea market is a common place for collectors to find unique and rare items, making it a likely choice for where the person may have acquired their collector items. None of the other options provide a logical connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the method of transportation is fast, which rules out options that are slower like ships, boats, trucks, and trains. It also suggests that the method of transportation is expensive, which rules out options like trucks and trains that are generally more affordable. The only option that meets both criteria is an airplane, which is known for its speed and high cost of operation.
A solar system is a star and all of the planets, moons, asteroids, and other bodies that orbit around it. The statement in the question describes a star with eight planets orbiting it, which matches the definition of a solar system. The other options, such as hollywood, night sky, constellation, and aliens, do not relate to the concept of a star with planets orbiting it.
The sentence is asking if someone would be willing to milk a cow, which suggests that the person needs help with this task. The phrase "step forward" implies that the speaker is looking for a willing volunteer to offer assistance. The other options do not relate to the request for help with milking a cow.
Based on the sentence, the food must be freeze-dried before it is taken on a specific vehicle. The options "fairgrounds" and "friend's house" do not fit the context because they are not vehicles. The options "oven" and "microwave" are household appliances and do not relate to transportation. Therefore, the correct answer is "space shuttle," which is a vehicle used for space travel and requires freeze-dried food due to weight restrictions and preservation needs.
The question is asking for a useful activity when experiencing loneliness. Socializing with others is a well-established way to cope with loneliness and can provide a sense of connection and belonging. Meeting people or making friends can also be helpful, but these options may take more time and effort. Making people laugh or drinking liquor may provide temporary relief, but they are not sustainable solutions for coping with loneliness.
The sentence suggests that the person is finishing their workday and is preparing to turn off their computer. The phrase "start menu" typically refers to the button on the desktop screen that allows the user to access various options, including shutting down or restarting the computer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about a person wanting to buy a radio, which is a consumer electronic product that is commonly sold in stores or shops that specialize in selling electronic devices. "Station" and "every car and house" are unlikely places to buy a radio as they suggest that the person may already have a radio or have access to one, rather than needing to purchase a new one. "Bedroom" is not a logical choice as it is typically a private space where one would not expect to find a store selling radios. "Space shuttle" is not a logical choice as it is a spacecraft designed for space exploration, not a place to buy consumer electronics.
The sentence suggests that the person heard a joke and responded in some way. The word "chatting" implies a casual, social situation. The answer can be found by process of elimination: "lie" and "smoke" do not make sense in this context. "Laughing" and "chuckle" are similar in meaning to "giggle," but "giggle" specifically suggests a light, playful laugh, which is often how people respond to jokes in a social setting.
The word "old" implies that the clothing has been stored away for a long time, which suggests that it might be found in a trunk or a suitcase. These items are often used for storage and may not be opened frequently, allowing clothing to accumulate inside. The options of a drawer, book shelf or washing machine do not provide a likely location for old clothing.
The word "obtuse" is often used to describe an angle that is greater than 90 degrees, and is therefore not acute (less than 90 degrees). Therefore, "acute angled" is the option that is logically contradictory to "obtuse." The other options may or may not be related to "obtuse," but they do not form a clear logical opposite.
The context of the sentence suggests that the word being sought is a result of learning. While all the answer choices are related to the concept of learning, the most appropriate option is "intelligence," which refers to a person's ability to reason, understand complex ideas, and solve problems. The other choices are either redundant (e.g., "education" and "gaining knowledge") or insufficient (e.g., "get to know") in capturing the meaning conveyed by the sentence.
The phrase "peak of his fandom" implies that the artist was at the height of his popularity, which is typically when artists take advantage of their success by monetizing their work. The phrase "cashing in" reinforces this idea by suggesting the artist wanted to make money. The term "selling out" specifically refers to compromising one's artistic integrity in exchange for financial gain, which is a common criticism artists face when they become too commercial. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "get away from them" suggests that Sam wants to physically distance himself from the people he met while traveling. Of the available options, "go out" is the only one that could potentially facilitate this action. "Come home" would bring Sam even closer to the people he wants to avoid, "airplane" may be a mode of transportation but it doesn't necessarily help Sam escape from the people he doesn't like, "learn from each other" suggests a desire to engage with the people he didn't like, and "make art" is completely unrelated to the situation presented in the question.
The sentence suggests that the children were excited to see Superman fly overhead, which would likely elicit a positive response or exclamation. "Awesome" is a commonly used exclamation to express excitement or admiration, especially in situations where something impressive or thrilling has occurred. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as there is no indication of pain or disinterest.
The sentence suggests that there is a way to identify illegitimate designer handbags, and one of those ways is through the absence of a certificate. The word "authentic" refers to something that is real or genuine, so it makes sense that illegitimate designer handbags would not have an authentic certificate. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the state being referred to is shaped like a glove and has a lot of farmland. Michigan is a state that is shaped like a mitten, resembling a glove, and it is known for having a significant amount of farmland. The other choices do not match the description given in the question.
The question is asking for a type of furniture that is specifically used for storing paper files, which eliminates options like computers and desks. The most common type of furniture used for this purpose is a filing cabinet, which typically has multiple drawers specifically designed to hold folders and files. While a desk may have a drawer that could be used for this purpose, it is not typically used for storing large quantities of paper files.
Excavation is a common practice in archeological sites and construction sites, as well as in building and city areas. However, it is considered disrespectful and illegal to conduct excavation in a cemetery. This knowledge is based on cultural and legal norms that dictate how human remains should be treated and protected. Therefore, among the given options, the only place that excavation should never take place is a cemetery.
The question mentions a specific type of view - a view of corn fields. Nebraska is a state known for its large corn production, making it a likely location for a steakhouse with such a view. The other options do not have a strong association with corn or steakhouse dining.
The sentence suggests that there is a consequence for harming property after starting a fire. Going to jail is a common punishment for committing arson, which involves setting fire to property on purpose. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that keeping marijuana in bags can assist with maintaining a specific quality or condition. Keeping marijuana in bags can help preserve its freshness and prevent it from becoming stale or dry. Knowing this, it's clear that the correct answer is "neat", because all of the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
A place that could have thousands of statues would need to be large enough to accommodate them, and would likely be a public space where people can enjoy the sculptures. Central Park in New York City has over 900 statues, monuments, and sculptures, making it a prime contender for the correct answer. The other options do not have as much space or significance as Central Park.
The sentence suggests that horse racing is the sport being referred to, as it mentions "gamblers" and "horse." The use of the phrase "not just the regular gamblers" suggests that there may be some special event or circumstance that is causing more people than usual to have horses, and therefore more people than usual are attending the sport. Of the choices given, only "race track" directly relates to horse racing, while the other options either refer to specific races (such as the Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown) or are general regions (such as the American Southwest) that do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person in the woods is wounded and alone, and the best option among the choices is to "doctor himself," which means to treat his own injuries. This may involve basic first aid techniques or using items in the environment to create makeshift medical supplies. The other options do not provide any help or assistance with the situation described in the sentence.
When a company goes public, it is offering shares of its ownership to the public for purchase. This process is known as an initial public offering (IPO) and allows the company to raise funds by selling shares to investors. Going public is often seen as a way to access more funding, as the company can use the funds raised through the IPO to finance its operations and future growth. The other options do not have a clear relationship to the context of a company going public.
The sentence suggests that the human is gazing down at something from space, indicating that they are in orbit around the earth. The description of the human's expression as "longingly" suggests they are missing something or yearning for it. The phrase "surface of earth" most accurately reflects what the human may be missing while they are in the artificial environment of the space station. The other answer options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that standing in a puddle is undesirable and the question is asking how to end up not standing in one. "Walking out of" makes the most sense as it means physically leaving the area of the puddle. "Move away from" and "laying in" may also prevent standing in a puddle, but they do not directly address the question. "Sweating" and "movement" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The question mentions "an Indian restaurant" and "the Space Needle," suggesting that John is likely at the Space Needle in Seattle and looking to order Indian food. Out of the given options, only "curry" is a type of Indian food that one might order at a restaurant. The other options either don't make sense in the context or are not related to food.
The question specifies that the mountain is located in an eastern state, which rules out options like Switzerland, Asia, and Austria. Picture is not a state and does not fit the parameters of the question. Pennsylvania is known to have several mountain ranges, including the Appalachian Mountains, making it a likely choice for the correct answer.
The context of the sentence is that Sam left his muddy shoes in the entryway, which suggests that he went into a building, not an open space like a garden or a department store. The options of school and office building are also plausible, but the use of the word "entryway" implies a residential setting rather than a professional or educational one.
The sentence suggests that the person just woke up, which means their eyes are likely closed. Opening their eyes would be the most natural thing for them to do as they become fully awake and alert. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is trying to protect their arm from being injured by taking the impact on another part of their body. In this case, the best option to take the impact would be the shoulder. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as it would not be practical or useful to try to take the impact on a leg, garment, torso, body, or road.
Deodorant is a personal hygiene product that is commonly sold in grocery stores alongside other health and beauty items like shampoo, toothpaste, and soap. It is designed to be applied to the armpits in order to prevent body odor, which indicates that option 3, "armpits," is not correct as it is not a location where deodorant can be purchased. The other two options, "medicine cabinet" and "medicine chest," refer to storage units for medications and are not retail locations where products can be purchased. Option 5, "kitchen," is also not correct as it is not generally a location where personal hygiene products are sold.
Taking a vacation is often associated with getting away from the stresses of everyday life and taking time to unwind and relax. Admiration and good things in life are not directly related to taking a vacation, while owning a house and needing money may be reasons why someone cannot take a vacation rather than reasons why they would choose to do so.
The phrase "take the lead with small papers" suggests a card game where players use small cards to gain an advantage or take the lead. The other options (very heavy, video game, news article, lead pencil) do not have any clear connection to playing with small papers.
Drugstores commonly sell a variety of health and hygiene products, including hairbrushes and bandages. Hospital, car, and bedroom do not typically have stores that sell these items, while "house" is too broad for a specific answer.
The context of the question suggests that it is related to a reception, which is often associated with events such as weddings. At a wedding reception, the center table is typically reserved for the wedding party, which consists of the bride and groom, their parents, and the bridesmaids and groomsmen. The other options listed do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the clothing was priced higher than usual, which implies that it was likely purchased at a store that specializes in high-end or luxury items. Department stores are often associated with selling expensive clothing brands and designer items, making it the most fitting choice among the given options. The other options, like a cinema hall or a closet, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about what is used to print, which implies a writing or drawing instrument. A pencil is not used for printing as it leaves a mark by removing graphite from the pencil lead, while a newspaper and printer are output devices rather than input devices. A squid, while capable of ejecting ink, is not a tool for printing text or images in a human context. A fountain pen, on the other hand, is filled with ink and used to produce clean, consistent lines on paper, making it a suitable answer.
Candles are commonly used in dining settings to create a warm and intimate atmosphere. They are often placed on tables, particularly in dimly lit rooms or at night, to provide additional light and add to the ambiance. The other options do not make as much sense as candles are typically not associated with kitchen or wall decor, and birthday cakes already have candles on them.
FC is a well-known fast food restaurant chain that primarily serves chicken. The other options, such as plate, bowl, freezer, and oven, do not describe what KFC is or what it does.
The sentence suggests that John did not enjoy having sex or engaging in sexual activities. Specifically, he had a "hangup" about being naked, which implies that he may have felt uncomfortable or self-conscious when unclothed. The other options are all related to sexual activity, but do not specifically address the issue of nudity or John's discomfort with being naked.
The other options all suggest places where a marmoset could go or travel to. Marmosets are non-flying animals and do not typically burrow underground, but they are known to live in the wilderness and could potentially be found in Colorado. However, there is no reason why a marmoset would be associated with a dictionary, making it the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the child is on his way to play, but it doesn't mention anything about the child already being happy or entertained. It's possible that the child may laugh or feel happy while playing, but that's not what the question is asking. The sentence mentions that the child is "going" to play, which implies movement, so it's more likely that the child will walk slowly towards his destination rather than sit still or run.
The question is asking for a factor that can prevent someone from getting sleep at night. "Relax" and "dreams" are not factors that prevent sleep, but rather ways to promote it. "Have nightmares" is a factor that can disrupt sleep, but not necessarily prevent it from occurring. "Snore" is a behavior that can disrupt someone else's sleep, but not necessarily their own. "Restlessness" is a common factor that can prevent someone from getting enough sleep and is often linked to anxiety or discomfort.
The phrase "reaching advantage position" suggests that the person has gained an advantage over their competitors. The phrase "upper hand" is commonly used to describe having an advantage or being in control of a situation, whereas the other options do not necessarily connote an advantage in a competition. "Determination" and "skill" may contribute to a person's success, but they do not necessarily indicate that the person has already achieved an advantage over others. "Superior" and "higher position" are also possible answers, but "upper hand" is a more natural fit for the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the chair was meant to be used in a workspace where the speaker could receive visitors while working. The most likely location for this would be an office. The other options, such as a building, library, or table, are too general and do not specifically indicate a workspace. The option of a bathtub is also clearly not the correct answer, as it is not a logical location for a chair meant for receiving visitors.
Wine is commonly stored in a cool, dark place to ensure its quality and flavor are preserved. The attic may be not ideal since it often gets hot and sunlight can damage the wine. Art show and church are not related to wine storage in any way. A bar may store wine, but it may not be the best option for long-term storage as they may not have a controlled environment.
The sentence suggests that John's motivation for spending a lot of money on products for his swollen testicles was not enjoyment, but rather pain. The word "agony" indicates that John was probably experiencing considerable discomfort from his swollen testicles, which led him to seek relief through various products. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that people talk to him as if he is a child, despite his physical disability not affecting his brain. This implies that his mental capacity is unaffected by his disability. The options "strength", "potential", "qualification", and "competence" are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not suggest any connection to his mental capacity.
The context suggests that the question is related to a speech taking place in the capital, and the phrase "biggest speech" may refer to a speech that is significant or important. The State of the Union address is a major speech given by the President of the United States in the capital, in which they discuss the state of the country and outline their legislative agenda for the coming year. The Gettysburg Address is a famous speech delivered by President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, but it is not given annually and does not take place in the capital. The other options (each state, each country, Europe) are not related to the context of the question.
The context suggests that the presence of children has led to the accumulation of many plastic things in a specific place. The most likely place for children's things in the home would be the "own home" option. "Cupboard" and "cabinet" are too specific and do not necessarily imply the presence of children. "Everything" is a vague option that does not fit the context. "Garbage dump" is clearly not a realistic option in this context.
The word "competing" implies a contest or competition, where individuals or teams are striving to win against others. To have an "edge" in this context means having an advantage or superiority over the competition, which is what people typically look for when competing against others. The other options may be relevant in other contexts, but they do not fully capture the essence of competition as described in the question.
The sentence mentions drought regulations, which suggests that the location of the swimming pool is in a place affected by a drought. California is a state known for its water shortages and droughts, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not provide any information about their location, and the mention of first floor suggests that the sentence may not be referring to an outdoor swimming pool.
The sentence suggests that the person in question is experiencing abandonment after a divorce or the end of a marriage. This would likely lead to feelings of isolation, as they may no longer have the same social support network that they had before the divorce. Grief might also be a possible response, as the end of a significant relationship can be emotional, but this would not necessarily apply to everyone in this situation. Pleasure and happiness are unlikely responses given the context of being abandoned, and "solo" is not a feeling in itself, but rather a description of being alone.
The context of the sentence mentions a bride and groom, which implies some kind of wedding ceremony. The choices "efficiency," "getting work done," and "finishing up" do not relate to this context, while "results" is too vague to be a likely answer. Therefore, "marriage" is the correct option.
The question asks specifically about something that is covered by the ocean, which eliminates options like waterfalls and rivers that are not typically found in the ocean. The clue "three quarters" suggests a large proportion, which eliminates options like beach that only cover a small strip of land. The most logical answer is the surface of earth, since the earth is mostly covered by water and the ocean is the largest body of water on earth.
The phrase "approached by a lot of people" suggests that the person in question is well-known and admired by many individuals, which are characteristics commonly associated with popularity. Compliments and caring about others may also lead to being approached, but not necessarily by a lot of people. Knowing all and understanding oneself are not related to the context of being approached by others.
The sentence indicates that the woman is good at entertaining, and people have acknowledged this quality by telling her something. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a word that has a positive connotation and implies a skill or ability. "Fun" and "learn about" are not directly related to the woman's ability to entertain, while "intelligence" and "recognize" are not appropriate choices since they do not match the context of the sentence. "Talent" is the best answer as it suggests a natural ability or aptitude for a particular activity, which fits with the woman's knack for entertaining.
The question is asking where someone would likely store a double edge razor, which is a type of razor commonly used for shaving. The options pocket, shower, chemist, and drug store are unlikely places to store a razor, as they are not designed for razor storage. A shaving kit, on the other hand, is a specifically designed container for razor storage and other shaving supplies, making it the most likely option for storing a double edge razor.
The sentence suggests that people are going to a specific location to watch a new movie, which is commonly done at a theater. The other options do not have any clear connection to watching a movie, such as a town or train station. The conference and bathroom are not places where people typically go to watch movies.
The question implies that the person in question is content, which is commonly associated with feeling happy or fulfilled. The other options do not necessarily have any correlation to being satisfied, such as boarding a ship or crossing a street, and may even be negative or unrelated activities, such as shouting at someone or grocery shopping.
The sentence suggests that Dave wanted his beer to be easily accessible but not on the floor, which makes the most sense if it is placed on a shelf. The other options do not provide a clear indication of a location where Dave could store his beer off the floor but still easily accessible.
The sentence suggests that when eating breakfast with a large family, there will be a lot of dishes to wash afterwards. This is a common occurrence when many people eat together, especially if they are preparing and using a variety of dishes and utensils. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where people gather to sit and face a stage or screen, as if watching a performance. The option "theater" is the most likely choice, as it is a venue specifically designed for this purpose. The other options may have chairs in them, but do not necessarily involve the specific layout or purpose of a theater.
The question asks for a place to store a chess pawn, suggesting that it needs to be some type of container or case. Out of the choices given, small case is the only one that fits this criteria. A chess set typically contains multiple pieces and doesn't provide individual storage for each piece, while strategy and chess game are not physical places to store a pawn. A toy store is also not a viable option as it is a location to purchase items rather than store them.
The sentence implies that the person is known for buying presents for others frequently. Buying gifts for others is often seen as an act of generosity, indicating that the correct answer is "generous." The other options are not applicable to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a shape similar to that of a glove and is also known for its lack of anemone. This eliminates choices like Michigan (not glove-shaped), tide pool (not a state), and Atlantic Ocean (not glove-shaped and too large for the context of the sentence). Nurseries are also not typically associated with anemone. This leaves the option Lake as the correct answer as it is both shaped like a glove and can be a habitat for anemone.
The sentence indicates that the keys are black and white, which is a common color scheme for piano keys. Therefore, the keys were most likely attached to a piano. The other options do not have any clear relationship to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that fish are doing something that does not involve grades or sitting at desks. The clue to the correct answer is in the phrase "school together" which means that the fish are swimming in a group with coordinated movement patterns. Fish are known to school together for protection and to increase their chances of finding food, which makes this option the most logical choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
The phrase "in charge of project" implies that the person is responsible for managing a project. In order to effectively manage a project, it is important to have knowledge about the subject matter at hand, as well as relevant skills and experience. Greed and worry are not traits that are typically associated with effective project management. "Take charge" and "boss" suggest a more authoritarian style of leadership, which may not be necessary or effective in all project management situations.
"Say goodbye" is a common phrase used to signal the end of a conversation, while "open letter" is a written communication, "thank god" and "bless you" are expressions of gratitude or blessings, and "listen to radio" has no connection to the context of ending a conversation.
The question is asking about a physical activity of running after a ball, which requires the use of one's legs. The other options, such as getting tired or skipping, do not relate to the fundamental requirement of having functioning legs. Additionally, being not fat or looking first do not directly contribute to the ability to physically run after a ball.
The word "graveyard" suggests a place where airplanes are stored when they are no longer in use, often because they are old or damaged beyond repair. This is commonly known as an airplane graveyard or boneyard. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question - "war" and "crash" could refer to situations where airplanes are used or damaged, while "aircraft carrier" and "sky" do not provide any information about where unused airplanes might be found.
The sentence suggests that the person is processing wool, which is commonly done using a spinning wheel. The phrase "kept her leg bouncing" also suggests a repetitive movement, which is similar to the motion of operating a spinning wheel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks for a location where a computer can be placed other than a desk, which implies that the location must be a flat surface that can support a computer. An apartment, school, office, or house could all technically have a desk, so they are unlikely to be the correct answer. A table, on the other hand, is a piece of furniture that can be found in various locations and can serve as an alternative to a desk.
The sentence mentions buying treats for kids, which is often associated with candy. Candy stores typically sell candy, sweets, and treats over a counter, making it the most likely option for the correct answer. The other options (butcher shop, kitchen, auto repair shop, post office) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that long term consumption of beer can lead to negative consequences, implying that it can be harmful to a person's health or well-being. Water and liquid are too broad and do not convey negative consequences. Foamy and intoxicating do not accurately reflect the negative consequences associated with long term beer consumption.
The question does not specify that a human makes any noise when going to sleep, which rules out options like snoring and talking. While a person may experience relaxation or loss of consciousness, those are not really "noises" they make. Dreaming also does not typically involve any audible sounds. Therefore, the correct answer is "None of the above."
The sentence conveys that the boy was too nervous to dance, which suggests that he may have felt uncomfortable or out of place in the context of the ball. The term "wallflower" is often used to describe someone who is shy or introverted and tends to stay on the sidelines at social gatherings, while the other options either contradict or do not provide any meaningful information within the context of the sentence.
The mention of a laundry room only used by staff implies that it is a part of a larger establishment rather than a single residence, such as a hotel or maybe even a hospital or office building. The other options do not have a clear need for a laundry room that is separate from the main area.
Beavers are known for building dams in bodies of water, such as streams, rivers, and ponds. They create a habitat for themselves in and around the body of water, which is why it is most likely that they leave in this environment. The other options, such as a zoo or a specific region like British Columbia, do not have a clear connection to the natural environment of beavers. Wooded areas may be near bodies of water, but the question specifically asks where a beaver leaves, suggesting that there is a specific destination in mind.
A village is typically a small, rural community, so the opposite would be a large, urban area. The term "big city" is commonly used to describe densely populated urban centers with a lot of cultural, economic, and social activity. The other options may be related to rural areas or communities, but do not necessarily represent the opposite of a village.
The use of the word "view" suggests that the artist was capturing a scene or setting, which is typically associated with landscapes. The other options, such as east side, countryside, middle america, and Georgia, do not necessarily convey the same visual imagery or context. Additionally, the use of the word "plain" suggests a simplicity or lack of complexity, which is again commonly associated with landscapes.
Boredom implies a lack of interest or stimulation, and watching a film on television is a common way to alleviate this sense of disinterest. The other choices, such as playing cards or chess or reading newspapers, may provide entertainment or engagement for some people but they are not activities typically associated with television. Surfing the net is also a possibility, but the sentence specifically mentions television.
The sentence describes a location with a beach and shallow water that is enjoyed by locals. It also implies that this location is not the ocean. The options "pond", "swimming pool", and "children's pool" are not likely to have a beach or shallow water. "Bathe in" is a vague phrase and can apply to any body of water. Therefore, the most logical and likely answer is "lake".
The sentence implies that not being good at playing the violin would have a negative impact on a person. It suggests that the person may feel sadness as a result of their inability to play the instrument well. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that the person wanted to preserve the cabbage for later use, which suggests that they would have stored it in a cooler environment. The most obvious option is the refrigerator since it is commonly used to keep food fresh for a longer period of time. The freezer is also a possibility, but it may affect the texture of the cabbage. The other options, such as the grocery store or supermarket, are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that listening to each other can lead to better understanding, which in turn suggests that people can share knowledge and insights with each other. "Swap bodies" and "believe in god" are not logical outcomes of improved communication or understanding. "Pay bills" and "talk to each other" do not necessarily require a deeper level of understanding or knowledge-sharing between people.
Zebras are wild animals commonly found in Africa. They are not typically found in museums, hospitals, desks, or opera houses. However, zoos often have exhibits that showcase different species of animals, including zebras. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "zoo."
The sentence suggests a situation where a human would sit for a long time over a bowl of water, which is commonly associated with activities related to personal hygiene. Bathrooms are the most likely location for this scenario to occur, as they are typically equipped with facilities for washing and grooming. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that John is feeling guilty for breaking something by accident that was located across the street from him. Since the only option related to something that could be located across the street is curtains, this suggests that John accidentally broke someone's curtains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "forgiving" implies that the person is not holding a grudge or anger towards someone else. Giving someone forgiveness typically results in them feeling a sense of relief and release from guilt or shame. Redemption and absolution both have religious connotations and are not necessarily a direct result of someone forgiving another person. Isolation and "feeling better" are not directly related to forgiveness either.
The sentence suggests that the salesman surprised the speaker by suddenly showing up, which is a characteristic commonly associated with appearing suddenly. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of shopping at a car dealership.
The use of the word "feat" implies that the achievement was impressive or challenging, suggesting that reaching a tentative agreement was not an easy task. "Accomplish" is the best option as it directly relates to achieving a difficult task. "Make progress" and "stop arguing" are not specific enough to describe the accomplishment and "do business" and "concert" do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the police man was using flares to direct traffic. The phrase "wave on" means to allow a vehicle to proceed, which would make sense in this context. The other options do not have any connection to the idea of directing traffic with flares.
Garbage is typically disposed of in a landfill, which is a designated area where waste is buried underground. A dumpster or trashcan may be used to collect trash, but it is eventually taken to a landfill or similar facility for disposal. Television and Fox News have no clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that we are looking for a place where many people have been, and where the air has been breathed. A train station is a busy location where many people pass through, and where the air is constantly circulating due to the movement of trains and people. The other options either do not have a large number of people passing through, or do not involve the circulation of air in the same way as a train station.
Potatoes are a commonly used ingredient in fast food restaurants, particularly for items such as french fries and hash browns. While potato may be sold in vegetable and produce markets, these options do not specifically suggest a business that uses lots of potatoes. Ireland is known for its potato production, but this answer does not necessarily indicate a business that uses potatoes. Dessert spots are not typically associated with potato usage.
When someone is convicted of a crime, the judge will pass sentence. This means that the judge will decide the appropriate punishment for the crime that was committed. The other choices do not accurately describe the role of a judge after a conviction. A judge does not conduct a trial, as the trial has already been completed. They do not make an arrest, as that is the job of law enforcement. While a judge does bring in a verdict, that happens before the conviction. "Serve justice" is a vague answer that could apply to any number of actions a judge may take, but is not specific to what they do after a conviction.
The sentence suggests that security guards are driving around in golf carts to protect young adults in a specific location. This scenario is commonly associated with college or university campuses, where security guards often patrol the grounds in golf carts to ensure the safety of students. The other options, such as concert venues or airports, do not typically use golf carts as a means of security transportation, and the reference to young adults suggests an educational setting.
The sentence suggests that the man needed flooring for a specific location, which is likely to be his house. While it is possible to install flooring in a loft or any other locations, the most common place to install flooring is in a house. In addition, the other options, such as Home Depot, tiles, and carpet store, are places where the man could potentially purchase the flooring he needs, but they do not indicate the location where the flooring will be installed.
Pamphlets on diseases and ailments are most commonly found at health departments, doctor's offices, or hospitals. These locations are generally associated with providing medical advice and education, so it's logical that they would have resources available for those seeking information about health-related topics. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that humans might do something when their legs are tired, which can be inferred as an action related to resting. Among the choices, only "sit down" is a common action performed to rest the legs, while the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence. "Make mistakes," "have sex," "reproduce," and "excrete" are not actions commonly performed when someone's legs are tired.
The Atlantic Ocean is a body of water that exists on the planet Earth. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that Mark is seeking the truth because he wants to stop living in a state of ignorance, which is the lack of knowledge or understanding about something. The word "ignorant" is given as one of the choices, but it is an adjective, not a noun that describes a state of being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking about an animal that produces milk, which is a well-known fact about cows. Cows are a common source of milk for humans, as they are raised specifically for their milk production. The other options are not animals and have no relation to milk production.
The sentence suggests that there is a place where disease can spread, but it shouldn't. Hospitals are often the location where diseases can easily spread from patient to patient if proper sanitation and hygiene protocols are not followed. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Beavers are known for building dams and lodges in order to create and manipulate bodies of water. This behavior is a key aspect of their survival as they rely on water for food and protection. The other options do not have any clear connection to the behavior of beavers.
The question suggests that cannon fire poses a threat to the person, which would require a material that is strong and resilient enough to withstand such an impact. Body armor is specifically designed to provide protection from projectiles like bullets and shrapnel, so it is the most appropriate answer option among the choices provided. The other options do not have any relation to protecting against cannon fire.
The sentence suggests that numbers are essential for the existence of society, which implies a connection to human populations. The options "population" and "populated area" directly relate to this idea, as they refer to areas where people live. "Create government" is not necessarily connected to the concept of numbers, and the options "group of people" and "make person sick" do not fit the context of the sentence.
Snakes are cold-blooded animals and are more commonly found in warmer climates such as the tropics. The other options, such as "nightmare," "Wyoming," and "bushes," do not have any clear connection to the context of the question and are less likely places for snakes to reside. "Field" could be a potential option, but it is not as specific as the tropical climate.
The sentence suggests that John was looking for a cheap and basic accommodation option. A motel is typically a budget-friendly lodging option that offers few amenities compared to a hotel. Farms, towns, and cities do not necessarily have an association with inexpensive lodgings, and a hotel typically offers more luxurious amenities than what John was looking for.
The other options all relate to places where a person may commonly take their car (city, repair shop, parking lot, neighbor's house), while taking a car down a river is an activity that is not commonly associated with vehicles. The use of "not happy" suggests that the person may be reluctant or unhappy about the idea of taking their car to any of the listed locations, further indicating that "down a river" is the correct answer option.
The sentence suggests that Bill bought a large item that requires a specific location to be stored - an upright piano. This implies that he needed to have enough space in his living quarters to accommodate the instrument. The other options, such as a band or music room, would be places specifically designed for instruments and would not have been mentioned in this way. Additionally, college and university do not provide any indication of where Bill lived, as he could have lived on or off campus.
The sentence suggests that the viola is one of many instruments being played together. This is a common feature of orchestras, which typically consist of a wide variety of instruments. Symphony orchestras and chamber orchestras are both types of orchestras, but the other options (band, create music, and string quartet) do not typically feature a large variety of instruments.
The sentence suggests that the traders are working in a specific place, which is commonly referred to as an exchange. This is where stocks are bought and sold, and traders work on the floor to complete these transactions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the real estate agent was trying to gain the trust of someone by being polite and delightful, which is a characteristic often associated with someone who is charming. Being charming means that a person is likeable and pleasant, which can be useful when trying to gain someone's trust. The other options have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of the sentence.
Bus stations often provide maps for their passengers, as they are a useful tool for travelers to navigate around a new city. Maps can help passengers locate their destination, find nearby landmarks, and plan their route. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - a lottery ticket, for example, would not be found at a bus station and does not provide any practical assistance.
Small grapes are typically used for making wine, which requires them to be pressed in a wine press to extract their juice. While grapes may also be used in fruit cocktails or as a snack in a picnic basket, these options do not specifically reference the use of small grapes or suggest that they would be used in a wine press. Juices are typically made from a variety of fruits, not just grapes. Kitchens may also be a place for preparing grapes, but again, the sentence specifically references the use of small grapes, which have a specific purpose.
The sentence discusses rumors of monsters killing people, which could cause fear and anxiety in the general population. Panic is a common reaction to such rumors, as people may feel threatened and unsure of how to protect themselves. The other options do not seem to fit well with the context of the sentence. Getting in trouble, going to prison, and committing murder are all unrelated to the situation at hand, while mass hysteria is a potential consequence of panic rather than a possible answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that remembering past successes is likely to have a positive effect, which may inspire or motivate the person. It is common for people to look back on their accomplishments for inspiration when they are facing new challenges. The other options do not fit the context, as problems, crying, trauma, and nightmares are more negative outcomes that are not typically associated with reflecting on past successes.
The sentence suggests that the question is related to organizing columns of numbers. While some of the options (such as roman architecture, whitehouse, bridge, and pantheon) may be associated with columns in a literal sense, none of them are relevant to the context of the sentence. A spreadsheet, however, is a tool commonly used for organizing and manipulating data in columns and rows, which makes it the most likely answer.
Popcorn and cotton candy are commonly sold at fairs and carnivals, which are often held at fairgrounds. Additionally, the mention of "on the grass" suggests that the person is outdoors, which rules out the movie theater. While soccer games may have concessions, they are typically played on a field or stadium, not on grass. The countryside and state park options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that waiting for something can lead to a negative emotion or feeling, which is commonly associated with getting bored. When people have to wait for something for a long time, they might start to feel restless, tired, or uninterested, which can result in boredom. The other options do not reflect a common experience associated with waiting, except for worry, which may sometimes occur but is not the best fit for the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a place with lots of windows. Out of the provided options, "office" is the most likely answer as many offices have windows to let in natural light and provide a view of the outdoors. "Wall," "front door," and "tent" are unlikely to have lots of windows, while "space shuttle" does have windows, but it is not considered a corner area.
The question indicates that the person being helped is not able to speak coherently, which means they may have a speech impediment or disability that makes it difficult to communicate verbally. Sign language is a visual language that involves communicating through hand gestures and body movements, which would allow the person being helped to express themselves even if they cannot speak clearly. The other options do not relate to helping someone who cannot speak coherently.
The sentence suggests that combat is a primary method in war, but it also implies that there is a broader goal beyond simply fighting. The phrase "conquer opponent" fits this context, as it suggests a strategic goal of defeating the enemy and gaining control over their territory. The other options either focus solely on fighting or are not relevant to the context of war.
The question is asking for a word that describes something that is not needed. The word "unnecessary" fits this meaning exactly. The other choices do not convey the same meaning. "Satisfied" refers to a feeling of contentment, not the object itself. "Luxury" suggests something that is not essential, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not needed. "Sufficient" means there is enough of something, but it does not convey a sense of necessity or lack of necessity. "Extra" also suggests something additional or surplus, but it does not necessarily imply that it is not needed.
The context suggests that the bag is used to hold laundry. A large netted drawstring bag is a common item used to transport dirty laundry to and from the laundry room. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the investigator found some gun evidence, which he had to send to a particular location. One plausible location for gun evidence to be sent is the police station, where it can be analyzed by ballistics experts to determine if it was used in a particular crime. The other options do not make much sense – returning the gun to its owner or putting it in a drawer would not help with the investigation, and leaving it at the crime scene or in a holster would contaminate the evidence.
A passage from the bible is typically read but not written by the reader. The bible is a holy book that contains passages and teachings that are meant to be read by believers, but it is not customary to write in the bible itself. The other options do not involve written texts that are traditionally read but not written by the reader, making them less likely to be the correct answer.
The sentence suggests that the armchair is used by only a few people, indicating that it is likely located in a private or personal space. An apartment or furniture store may have armchairs that are used by a variety of people, so they are unlikely options. A doctor's office or hospital may have armchairs that are used by many people on a daily basis, making them unlikely options as well. A study is a room that is often used by only a few people, making it the most likely answer.
The sentence indicates that the house is lacking humidity, which can be increased by introducing more moisture into the air. A humidifier is a device designed to add moisture to the air, making it the correct answer. The other options, such as the surface of the earth or a skating rink, have no relevance to the issue at hand. The option "burn it to the ground" is clearly not a reasonable solution.
This question implies that rooms that face outside have certain features in common. The most logical feature that all such rooms would have is doors and windows, which would allow for natural light and ventilation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence specifically says "on the side of their head," which eliminates the options of two feet and horns, as those are not typically located on the side of a human's head. The option of lay eggs is also eliminated as humans do not lay eggs. This leaves us with the option of two ears, which is a universal feature among all humans located on the side of their head. The option of one head is irrelevant as it is not a distinguishing feature among humans.
A harpsichord is a keyboard instrument often associated with classical music, particularly from the Baroque era. While it is possible to hear a harpsichord in other settings, such as a museum exhibit or a performance by a band that incorporates classical music, the most likely place to hear a harpsichord is in a concert hall, where classical music concerts are typically held. The options "make noise" and "rubber band" are not likely places to hear a harpsichord, and do not make sense in the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the woman has been struggling to get a job despite being qualified, which can be a frustrating experience. The other options (employment, working hard, love) do not accurately reflect the emotional state that the woman is likely feeling. Stress could be a possible answer, but it is not as strongly implied as frustration.
The sentence suggests that being a model has some connection to looking beautiful, which is often associated with the profession. Models are generally hired to showcase clothing or products, and their appearance is a key factor in how effective their performance is. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The adjective "highly criticized" suggests that the security in question has received a lot of negative feedback or scrutiny. Among the options provided, airports are often subject to extensive security measures, including controversial procedures such as body scanners and pat-downs. The other options (university, concert, home, terminal) may have security systems in place, but they are typically not subject to the same level of criticism as airports.
The word "secular" refers to things that are non-religious or not related to spirituality. Therefore, the question is likely asking about how often non-religious parties or events are held. The word "frequent" makes the most sense in this context, as it suggests that secular parties are held often. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to a different aspect of parties (such as their length or size) or are irrelevant (such as "eternal").
The question implies that exercising has a specific purpose, and one of the most common reasons for people to exercise is to lose weight. Exercise helps burn calories, which can lead to weight loss when paired with a healthy diet. The other options, such as fatigue and relaxation, do not necessarily encourage exercise or provide a clear reason why exercise would be beneficial.
Fear can cause a person to experience a fight or flight response, which can include a physical reaction such as urination. This is known as the "fear-pee" response and is a common physiological response to fear. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The act of putting on makeup is generally associated with enhancing one's physical appearance. While some people may also derive pleasure from the act of applying makeup, the main goal is often to improve one's looks in order to receive compliments and feel more attractive. The options "interesting experiences" and "joy" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that more learning will lead to some kind of change in your knowledge. The options "headaches" and "bigger brain" are unlikely outcomes of learning, while "education" is too broad and general. "Knowing more" is too similar to the question itself and does not provide new information, leaving "growth" as the best option. Growth suggests that learning will lead to an expansion, improvement, or development of knowledge.
The word "tore" suggests that the wind was very strong and violent, which would fit with the option "blowing hard". The other options do not imply the same level of force and destruction that would be necessary to tear off shingles from a roof. "Dry hair" and "spreading" are too vague and do not give a clear indication of the wind's strength, while "change direction" and "wave wheat" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Dan has outfitted his house to run on the oldest heat source on Earth. Fire is the oldest form of heat used by humans and has been used for cooking, warmth, and light since prehistoric times. Solar energy and the sun are not heat sources that have been consistently used throughout human history. House is not a heat source at all, but rather a place where heat is contained. Coal or wood may be used as fuel for fire, but fire itself is the oldest heat source.
Horses are domesticated animals that are often kept for riding, racing, or agricultural purposes. They are typically housed in stables or farm yards where they have access to food, water, and shelter from the elements. While some horses may live at a race track during training and racing seasons, it is not a typical living arrangement for them. Michigan and Arizona are states and therefore not suitable living environments for horses.
The word "why" suggests that we are looking for the reason or motive behind the woman's singing. The option "insane" is a derogatory and incorrect assumption about her mental state. "Annoy people around" implies that she sings to irritate others, which is unlikely to be the reason behind her behavior. "Inhale" is not related to the context of the sentence. The option "had good voice" could be a possibility, but the sentence does not provide evidence to support it. The most likely answer is that she sings because she enjoys it, which is a common motive for performing music.
The sentence suggests that there is a particular body of water in Michigan that is known for being very large or impressive (referred to as "the greatest of Michigan's greats"), and that ice fishing can be done on this body of water even when it freezes over. Only Lake Superior fits this description, as it is the largest of the Great Lakes and is known for having a harsh winter climate. The other options do not match the context provided in the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person referred to still sleeps on a sofa bed in his parents' house, despite being an adult. The options "garage," "horseradish," and "basement" are unlikely places for someone to sleep. "Guest room" is also unlikely, as it implies that the person is a guest in their own parents' house. Therefore, the most likely answer is "living room," as this is a common room in a house and may be a place where a sofa bed is located.
The sentence suggests that James keeps his clipboard close at hand for easy access. Typically, people keep items they use frequently on their desk, making it the most likely option among the choices. The other options are either nonsensical or do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the mother was concerned about spills, and she specifically bought a rug to go under something. Since spills often occur during mealtime, it is reasonable to assume that the rug was purchased for a table. The other options do not relate to spills or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions that the smell is coming from the kitchen, which is typically where cupboards are located. Cupboards can sometimes contain food items that have gone bad and can produce stale smells if not properly disposed of. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the use of invitro is being considered as a solution to some kind of problem related to reproduction. This could refer to issues with fertility, genetic disorders, or other medical conditions that make it difficult or impossible to conceive and carry a child to term. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Walking barefooted on wet ground can lead to a higher risk of slipping and falling, as well as contracting infections from bacteria and parasites found in the moisture. Wet ground can also be more slippery than dry ground, increasing the risk of accidents. The other options do not address the potential hazards of walking barefooted after the rain.
The word "differences" suggests that there are multiple things being compared. To find the total or combined value of these differences, you would need to add them together, which is represented by the word "sum." The other answer choices imply a sense of similarity or likeness, which does not accurately reflect the concept of differences being added together.
The word "procreation" refers to the act of reproducing and creating offspring. In the context of this question, the term "success" is being used to describe a positive outcome when attempting to reproduce. The other options such as celebrating or having a party are not related to the process of procreation and do not make sense in the given context. Hearing a crowd go mad or creating success are also not relevant options in this context.
The word "janitor" implies that the person is responsible for cleaning and maintaining a building or facility. The options "kitchen," "hardware store," and "garage" are unlikely places for a janitor to keep their cleaning supplies. A "wishing well" is a decorative feature and not a practical location for a cleaning tool. A "utility room" is a room in a building dedicated to storing cleaning supplies, tools, and other necessary facilities maintenance equipment. Therefore, it is the most logical answer.
The sentence suggests that the doctor recommended washing hands, which is commonly associated with promoting health and preventing the spread of germs. Washing hands can help prevent the spread of illnesses and germs, which is why it is often recommended by doctors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the cloth's usual location is somewhere specific and that they need to be put back there. The correct answer is likely a place where household linens are usually kept, such as a linen closet. The other options, such as the kitchen or a fabric store, do not make as much sense and are unlikely locations for household linens. Putting the cloth on a space heater is potentially dangerous, and the bedroom may or may not be the right location depending on the context of the situation.
Listening vinyl refers to vinyl records for listening to music. Record stores are where people usually buy vinyl records, as they specialize in selling music in physical formats. Safeway is a grocery store chain, and it is unlikely that they sell vinyl records. "Record albums" is a vague option that could refer to any place that sells music in physical and digital formats. "Car" and "wallpaper" have no connection to the context of buying vinyl records.
The word "peculiar" is often used to describe unusual or unexpected behavior, so in this case, it suggests that the side effects Sally experienced were not typical or expected. The other choices all have positive connotations and do not fit with the context of the sentence, which suggests that the side effects were not desirable.
The context of the sentence suggests that the student is sitting in front of keys, which is a common element of a piano. Playing the piano involves choosing and striking keys on the instrument, which corresponds to the action of sitting in front of black and white keys. The other options, such as talking or reading a book, do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the robot had a sudden ability to read books, suggesting that it had recently acquired this skill. This would imply that the robot had learned how to read, making "learn to read" the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The cabin in an airplane is the enclosed space where the passengers sit during the flight. The purpose of the cabin is to transport people safely and comfortably from one location to another. The other options do not accurately describe the purpose of the cabin.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is indicating where a pen can be purchased. The most likely location for purchasing a pen is an office supply store, which is specifically designed to sell office-related items, including pens. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence is asking what the bean bag chair should be placed on, and the answer would likely be something sturdy and flat. The options 'house', 'den', and 'family room' all refer to indoor spaces where the chair might be located, but they do not answer the question about what the chair should sit on. 'Wood' is a material that might be used in furniture construction, but it does not indicate where the chair should be placed. 'Floor' is the most logical answer, as it is a flat and stable surface for furniture.
The sentence provides several clues that can help identify the correct answer. First, the city is located in Northern Norway and is known for its activities during the Polar Nights half marathon. Second, the city is situated in the middle of the Northern lights oval, which suggests that it is a popular destination for viewing the Northern Lights. The only city that meets these criteria is Tromsø. The other options may be cities in Norway, but they do not match the specific details provided in the sentence.
The other choices, such as college dorm, backpack, or classroom, do not typically sell binders. An office supply store is a place where individuals can purchase various office or school supplies, including binders.
The sentence suggests that James had a connection, which is commonly used to refer to a secondary flight that a passenger must catch in order to reach their final destination. Airports often have connecting flights, making it the most likely option among the choices given. The other options (company, wall, computer network, love) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a cleaning agent and disinfectant in chemistry labs. Safety glasses are also required in chemistry labs for eye protection during experiments. The other choices, such as a pub or restaurant, would not typically have isopropyl alcohol or safety glasses readily available. They are also not essential items for use in a park or supermarket setting.
The sentence suggests that the man was not able to run, which implies that he could still move using another method. It can be inferred that the only way the man could move was by walking, as it is the only option in the choices that involves movement other than standing still. The other options either do not involve movement or do not reflect the context of the sentence.
The sentence establishes that molecules make up everything you can "hold", implying something that can be physically grasped. The options "atom", "air", and "anything" do not necessarily fit this criteria, while "feet" is an odd choice that doesn't make logical sense. "Hands" is the most appropriate answer as it is part of the body that is used for physically holding things.
The term "foolhardy" implies recklessness or lack of thoughtfulness, so the opposite should be a trait that involves careful consideration and planning. Among the given choices, "thoughtful" and "discreet" could be related to being cautious, but they do not quite capture the sense of deliberate risk aversion that is implied. "Calculative" may suggest a certain level of rationality, but still lacks the connotation of prudence. "Careful" is the most fitting antonym of "foolhardy," as it denotes a state of being attentive and cautious in avoiding danger or mistakes.
The question suggests that the location being described is where one can both exercise and consume juice. The term "get in shape" typically refers to fitness activities, which aligns with the choice of "gym." The other options, such as "fridge," "limejuice," and "refrigerator," do not have any connection to the context of the question. "Square" is a possible distractor, but there is no indication in the question that it would be a relevant location.
The sentence suggests that the question is asking for a method or activity that allows people to meet or gather together. "Believe in god" and "pay bills" are not activities that necessarily involve socializing or meeting with others. "Enjoy themselves" may involve socializing, but it is not a specific method for people to meet each other. "Face each other" is a physical orientation and not an activity. "Group together" is the only option that directly suggests people coming together in a social context.
Horses are herbivores and their primary source of energy comes from the plants they eat, such as grass and hay. Playing and being kept in stables may be part of a horse's routine, but they do not directly contribute to their energy intake. "Dominated" is not a behavior that horses exhibit to get energy. Horses cannot drink coffee as it contains caffeine, which is harmful to them.
The sentence suggests that there are some people standing in a line near a road, which is a scene commonly seen at a bus stop as people wait in line for a bus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the museum put a stuffed koala somewhere where you would normally find a panda, which implies that the two animals share a similar habitat or environment. Pandas are known to live in bamboo forests, so it makes sense that the koala would be displayed in a bamboo grove. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "immediately" suggests that the answer is related to an immediate effect of exercising. Exercising is commonly known to boost energy levels and create a feeling of alertness and vigor, which fits the option "energetic". "Relaxation" is not typically an immediate effect of exercising, and "exhaustion" may occur after exercising for a prolonged period of time. "Becoming stronger" is a long-term goal of exercising rather than an immediate effect. "Using energy" is a vague option and does not necessarily relate to the immediate effect of exercising.
The sentence suggests that the person finds relaxation in a simple act that involves opening something up. Among the given choices, only "read book" fits this description. Reading a book involves opening it up and immersing oneself in the story, which can be a form of escape and relaxation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that one person has done something that has caused harm to another person. Feeling sorry is a common response to causing harm, as it indicates remorse and a desire to make amends. Trusting God, crossing the street, riding a bike, and lending money do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "something forbidden" suggests a reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where they were not allowed to eat from the tree of knowledge. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question specifies that the food item must fit in your hand, which eliminates options like cupboard, chocolate, and coffee. The remaining options are candy bar and soda pop. While soda pop does have a lot of sugar, it is not necessarily a food that fits in your hand, especially since it usually comes in a can or bottle. Candy bars, on the other hand, are a common snack food that are often small enough to fit in your hand and are known for containing high amounts of sugar. Therefore, the correct answer is candy bar.
The term "reception area" is commonly associated with a space inside an office building where visitors wait before meeting with someone. The other options, such as hotels, motels, or law firms, may also have reception areas, but they are not as commonly associated with this term. A hall could refer to any type of hallway, so it doesn't specifically indicate a reception area.
The sentence suggests that the person in question was not skilled at dancing, so the instructor likely taught her something fundamental to improve her ability. Rhythmic movement is a basic dance skill that involves moving the body in time with the beat of the music. The other options are not related to basic dance skills and would not be helpful in improving someone's ability to dance.
The sentence suggests that Billy's mother tripped over one of his things in a specific location. The most logical location for this to happen in a house would be a hall, which is a commonly used passage between rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the student wants to hear what the professor is saying, indicating that their goal is to understand the lecture. The best way to achieve this goal is by actively listening to the professor. Taking notes can also help in retaining information, but it is not the primary action that would help the student to hear what the professor is saying. Completing a test or gaining experience are not relevant to the situation, and focus alone may not be sufficient for effective listening.
Going for a run is typically associated with exercise and physical activity. While it is possible to feel sore and tired after a run, the question is asking about how someone would feel after completing the activity. Feeling a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment is a common response to completing a workout or physical activity such as running. Falling down is not a likely outcome of going for a run and is therefore an incorrect answer.
The sentence suggests that the student is about to complete their education, which would indicate that they will no longer be attending school. The other options do not have a clear connection to graduating from school.
The sentence implies that there are certain societal expectations placed on adult people, and paying bills is a common responsibility associated with adulthood. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A broken icebox is an appliance that is no longer functional and is therefore considered to be a piece of junk or waste. Junk yards are locations where people can take their unwanted items, including appliances such as iceboxes, to be disposed of or salvaged. The other options are not relevant or appropriate places to dispose of a broken icebox - an antique store would likely not want a broken appliance, the graveyard is not a place for garbage, the kitchen is not a disposal site, and ice is not a disposal method.
The sentence suggests that Mary was known for being upfront and honest about her behavior, despite being described as "bad." This implies that honesty is a positive trait in Mary and may be the reason why people liked her. The other options, such as "excellent" or "worthy," do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not supported by the information given. "Fun" and "choice" may be positive traits, but they do not have any clear connection to Mary's behavior or why people liked her.
Sea World is a well-known theme park that features aquatic animals and exhibits. One of the attractions at Sea World is the shark tunnel, which allows visitors to view sharks swimming above them in an enclosed, clear tunnel. While sharks can be found in various locations such as the South Pacific, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico, the question specifically mentions a clear tunnel, which suggests that the answer is Sea World, as it is the only option that directly relates to this feature.
The context of the sentence suggests that Dan believes getting in line would be the best choice because it would lead to less confusion. When people form orderly lines, it becomes easier to manage and control a crowd. This reduces confusion and helps everyone move through the line in an efficient manner. The other options are unlikely as they do not fit the context of the sentence or do not make sense in the given situation.
The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where actors are not paid. One of the most common places where unpaid actors may perform is in a school setting, such as in a school theater program or a drama club. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the competition involved holding an object with an extended arm, which suggests that the correct choice is likely to involve "holding" the object. The other options do not adequately address the action of maintaining a straight arm while sustaining the weight of an object. "Lift up" and "pick up" both involve the initial action of raising an object, while "lifting" does not specify that the arm must be extended straight out. "Hold onto" implies a tight grip rather than an extended arm.

The question specifically asks about a program, which suggests that the correct answer must be related to something that is broadcasted on TV. Among the choices given, only "television" is a medium for broadcasting programs. Concert, opera, and theater, while often televised, are not specific enough or appropriate given the context of the sentence. "Take class" is also not relevant to the question.
Velvet is a type of fabric, so the most logical place for someone to look for this material would be a fabric store. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A bus station is often located in a central location within a city, usually in the city center. This is because it makes it convenient for passengers to access the station from different parts of the city, as well as to transfer between different bus routes. Schools, streets, and catching a bus may not necessarily be convenient locations for a bus station, and maps are simply tools used to locate or navigate to a bus station.
The sentence suggests that the crowd was not large, and the term "small group" best fits that description. The other options do not accurately reflect the size of the crowd mentioned in the sentence. Field and solitude refer to locations or feelings rather than group size, while alone and solitary imply an absence of other people altogether.
In this sentence, the word "dried" indicates that the silverware has been washed and needs to be stored somewhere until it's ready to be used. The most common place to store clean silverware is in a cupboard, where it can be easily accessed when needed. The other options - table, restaurant, kitchen, and sink - are not appropriate for storing silverware.
The sentence suggests that eggs were purchased from a store and brought home, indicating that they were likely packaged in a container that could be easily transported. The other options, such as a chicken coop or henhouse, are places where eggs are laid and collected, but not packaged for sale in stores. A supermarket is also unlikely to be the answer, as they typically sell pre-packaged eggs in egg cartons. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely egg carton.
The question is asking for the most logical place to leave an account book if you are leaving and do not need to bring it with you. Since the account book contains important financial information, it should be kept in a safe and secure location. Of the choices given, keeping it in a desk drawer would be the most suitable option, as a desk is a common place to keep important documents in an office setting. The other options, such as keeping it with an accountant or in a bank, may not be feasible if you are leaving for an extended period of time. The option of keeping it in a purse would not be a secure option for important financial information.
When clothes have developed an unpleasant odor, the best course of action is typically to air them out. This involves hanging them outside or in a well-ventilated area to allow fresh air to circulate through the fabric and neutralize any odors. The other options (hanging in the closet, sniffing, getting dirty, becoming soiled) are not effective solutions for dealing with smelly clothes.
Playing football is known to be a highly physical and competitive sport, which can lead to injuries and pain. However, the word "feel" in the question suggests that it is asking about emotional or psychological sensations rather than physical ones. Exhilaration is a common feeling associated with sports in general and football in particular, as the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of victory can create a sense of excitement and joy in players. The options "pain," "death," "getting hurt," and "get hurt" are all negative and do not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the wood underwent a process of fossilization, which is commonly referred to as petrification. Fossilization occurs when organic materials are replaced by minerals over time, resulting in a hard, rock-like substance. The other options do not accurately describe the process of fossilization or the resulting substance.
The question is asking for a specific type of store where someone can buy a teddy bear. A thrift store typically sells used items, so it is unlikely that they would have a large selection of new teddy bears. A bed, shelf, or home are not options for purchasing a teddy bear. A toy store, on the other hand, specializes in selling toys and would likely have a variety of teddy bears to choose from.
The question is asking about the negative consequence of being unable to learn. "Distress" is the most logical answer, as not being able to learn can lead to frustration, disappointment, and emotional discomfort. It is also possible that the inability to learn could impact effectiveness and educational achievements, but these options are not as directly related to the negative emotional experience suggested by the question. "Intelligence" and "a stupid" are not appropriate choices as they are not consequences, but rather intrinsic qualities that cannot be changed by one's ability to learn.
The question asks about who the government helps with schools. The correct answer would be school children because the government's primary responsibility is to provide education to its citizens, which includes school children. The other options, such as parents or those who require to pay taxes, would not be the primary beneficiaries of government help in this context.
The sentence provides context that the lost dog is in New England. New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the United States, so it would be the most likely choice for where the small dog would be found. The other options do not have any clear connection to New England or dogs being lost.
The word "bound" means to be tied together or held together in some way. Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question of how to hold loose papers together. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question. "Tighten" implies that the papers were loose because they were not secure enough, "packaged" implies that the papers are being prepared for transport, "faithful" is not related to the question at all, and "compact" does not relate to holding papers together.
The phrase "talking on the corner" suggests that the people in question were engaged in conversation with others who were also present on the corner. The other answer options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person was happy to find someone who was as unattractive as they were, implying that they themselves were not considered attractive. The only option that matches this context is "ugly," while the other choices all describe someone who is aesthetically pleasing or attractive.
The sentence suggests that the band enjoyed the excitement of their fans and their success, which indicates that they may have been known for their energetic performances. The phrase "hear the crowd go mad" specifically suggests that the band enjoyed the exhilaration of the audience's response at the beginning of each concert. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not provide any clear connection to the band's enjoyment of their success and fans.
The sentence suggests that there was a lot of talking during the brainstorming session, indicating that people were actively participating in sharing ideas and discussing different perspectives. The options "obtaining information" and "gathering of information" suggest a more passive role, whereas "sharing information" and "conversation" do not necessarily imply the collaborative and dynamic nature of a brainstorming session. Therefore, "exchange of ideas" is the best fit for the context given.
The word "owned" in the sentence suggests that the rulers belong to different people, which rules out "measure distance" as an option. "England" is not relevant to the context of the sentence, while "office" and "desk" suggest a specific location but do not specify where the rulers might be stored. "Drawer" is the most likely option as it is a common place to keep small items such as rulers and can be used by multiple individuals in a shared space such as a classroom or workplace.
The word "greasy" implies that the teens in question have oily skin. Grooming is often recommended to help manage oily skin by keeping it clean and reducing the buildup of excess oil. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to purchase something specific (barbecue sauces) and is seeking advice on where to buy them. The most logical option would be a retail store that specializes in selling food products, as they are likely to have a variety of different barbecue sauces to choose from. The other options (detroit, australia, michigan park, cafe) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to offer a wide selection of barbecue sauces.
The word "mammoth" suggests that this question is referring to a prehistoric animal, which is more likely to be found in a museum or exhibit rather than in a modern-day environment like a refrigerator or forest. The mention of NYC narrows down the options further, and the most likely place to find a mammoth exhibit in NYC is the American Museum of Natural History.
The word "put" and the mention of olives suggest that the question is asking about storage. The option "refrigerator" also indicates this. However, the clue "to prevent them from getting nearby food wet" suggests that the olives need to be contained separately. The option "jar" fits this description best as it is a container that can be sealed to keep the olives isolated from other foods. The other options do not offer a clear solution to the problem of keeping the olives dry.
The context of the sentence implies that there is a specific etiquette observed when dining at a formal place. One of these is to sit properly at the table. Being sociable, talking, and drinking may also be part of the experience, but they are not the main action being asked here. "Medium" does not make sense in the given context.
Ponds are typically small bodies of shallow water, often created by natural or man-made depressions in the ground. They are too small to be considered lakes, which are typically deeper and larger bodies of water. Swimming pools and children's pools are man-made and usually have a specific depth, while aquariums contain water specifically designed to support aquatic life and may have a variety of depths.
Nodding is a common nonverbal way of indicating agreement or understanding. It involves moving your head up and down, often in a subtle manner, to communicate agreement with or understanding of what someone else is saying. The other options don't make sense in the context of the question. "Like more" doesn't have any clear connection to indicating agreement, wearing rings is unrelated, and shaking hands can indicate agreement but it is more commonly used to greet someone or signify a deal has been reached. "Concordance" is a less common word that means agreement or harmony, but it is not a physical action that you would use to indicate agreement with someone.
The sentence suggests that James no longer wants to compete, indicating that he may be feeling a desire to quit or give up. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Pressure and trying harder suggest that James wants to continue competing but is experiencing difficulty, while death and winning or losing are unlikely to be the reasons why James wants to stop competing.
The sentence is giving advice on why it is important to wash your hands before eating. It explains that you do not want to get germs onto your food or inside your body. The logical part of the body where germs could enter is the mouth, which makes it the correct answer. The other choices are not directly related to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the explorers discovered something valuable or significant that was buried and located deep within a central passage. The most likely option among the choices is a tomb, since tombs are often located underground or within central structures, and are associated with the burial of important people or treasures. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that a rosebush can be found in a specific location or feature. "In the ground" is the most straightforward and logical answer, as it is common knowledge that rose bushes are planted in soil. The other options may also have rose bushes, but they are not as specific, and there is no direct evidence or association between them and the presence of a rose bush.
The sentence suggests that the man was driving himself to the airport, indicating that he likely had his luggage with him in the car. The trunk of a car is a common place to store luggage while driving, making it the most likely answer choice. The other options, such as a closet or sidewalk, do not make sense in the context of the sentence, while leaving the luggage at a hotel or bus stop would not be practical if the man was driving himself to the airport.
The question suggests that the gift is not a common or typical one, which means it is likely to be different or unusual in some way. The word "unique" means "one of a kind" or "unusual," so if someone receives a gift that is not common, they are likely to feel that it is unique. The other options either do not fit the context or have a negative connotation, such as feeling offended.
The question states that the banjo has its roots in the Caribbean, but the word "most famous" implies that it gained widespread popularity somewhere else. The United States is well-known for its strong tradition of banjo music, particularly in genres like bluegrass and folk. The other options, such as music shops, jug bands, or nice people, are not relevant to the history or popularity of the banjo.
The sentence suggests that the small print is causing discomfort or pain to the reader's eyes. Eye strain is a common consequence of reading small font for extended periods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that forgiveness can lead to the activation of a hidden force in one's life. "Karma" is often associated with cause and effect, where good actions lead to positive outcomes and bad actions lead to negative outcomes. Forgiveness is seen as a positive action that can lead to positive outcomes, thus activating good karma. The other options, while potentially positive outcomes of forgiveness, do not have a clear association with the idea of a hidden force being activated.
The question mentions keeping track of mistakes in baseball, which suggests that the answer is related to a term used to track mistakes. The answer "perfection" does not fit this context as it implies the absence of mistakes, whereas the question is specifically asking about tracking mistakes. "Happiness" and "sore muscles" are unrelated to the context and "injury" is related to a negative aspect of the game, but not specifically related to tracking mistakes.
The word "begin" suggests that the question is asking about the initial steps required to start creating art. Relaxation is a common prerequisite for creative work, as the mind and body need to be in a calm and receptive state to tap into one's imaginative resources. The other options do not seem directly related to the process of artistic creation.
The question implies that a reception with many people attending requires a spacious venue. The options that fit this requirement are large room, country club and grand casino. However, country clubs and grand casinos are known to be more expensive compared to large rooms, and restaurants and lobbies usually have smaller spaces. Therefore, the best choice would be a large room.
The question is asking for a solution to the problem of pens not working. The option "ink cartridges" is the most likely correct answer because it is a common cause of pens not working. Ink cartridges can become clogged or run out of ink, which can prevent the pen from writing properly. The other options, such as "take notes" or "scribble," do not address the problem of the pens not working, while the option "caps" may help prevent the pens from drying out but does not solve the current problem.
Architects are professionals who specialize in designing buildings, while builders and tradesmen are typically involved in the actual construction process. A driver has no direct connection to designing or building a building. "Fall down" is not a valid option as it is not a profession or role in the building process.
A bay is a body of water partially enclosed by land and connected to a larger body of water, such as an ocean. It is typically found in coastal areas where there are geographical features, such as peninsulas or capes, that create a space for a bay to form. Therefore, the correct answer is "coastal area", while the other options do not fit the definition of a bay.
The sentence suggests that people are engaged in a particular pastime while they are traveling along a liquid. The closest match to this context is sailboats, as they are designed to travel on liquid (water) and often provide a recreational activity for those on board. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that the location being described is a place where a movie theater and other stores are situated together. The most common place where this arrangement can be found is in a large shopping mall, which typically contains numerous stores and entertainment options like movie theaters, restaurants, and arcades. The other options are not as likely to offer this combination of amenities, making shopping mall the correct answer.
The sentence implies that the man on the street corner was trying to sell his wristwatch in order to get money to buy drugs. "Hock" is a slang term for pawning something, and a pawn shop would be the most likely place for someone to try to sell an item quickly for cash. The other options (jewelry store, case, watch store) do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not places where someone would sell an item quickly for cash, especially for drug money.
Home Depot is a well-known retailer for home improvement and building supplies, including flooring options. Walmart and kitchen are unlikely options for flooring purchases, while house and loft are too general and do not necessarily refer to specific retailers or places to buy flooring.
The sentence suggests that Bill was waking up, so the physiological response that would be occurring at this moment is the opening of his eyes. The other options may be related to how he feels (tiredness, grogginess, discomfort) or what he is doing (getting out of bed), but they do not directly relate to the process of waking up that is being described in the sentence.
The word "buying" suggests that the person is voluntarily purchasing beer, and the word "pleasure" is typically associated with consuming alcoholic beverages. The other options, such as "get arrested" and "problems," suggest negative consequences associated with drinking alcohol, while the option "sober" suggests the opposite of why someone might want to buy beer. "Intoxication" is a possible reason, but the word carries a negative connotation, while "pleasure" is a more neutral term that better fits the context.
The sentence suggests that the person is using a radio to communicate with a base, which indicates that they are likely in a remote location or some kind of vehicle. The options vessel and submarine suggest they might be on a boat or a submarine, but those options do not fit the context of reaching a base. The option lamp has no apparent connection to the sentence. Box could potentially refer to a portable radio, but the most likely option in this context is transistor as it is a common type of radio used for communication in remote locations.
The sentence suggests that the pizza was left in the oven for an hour, which is a long enough time for it to become overcooked or burnt. The option "smell smoke" could be a possible outcome if the pizza was left in the oven for too long and began to burn, but it does not directly answer the question based on the context of the sentence. "Catch cold," "look angry," and "bank savings" do not have any clear connection to the sentence.
The sentence implies that touching the wild animals could lead to a negative consequence, and the most likely one is that they could bite. Wild animals are not accustomed to being touched by humans and may perceive it as a threat, leading them to defend themselves by biting. The other options do not make sense or are unlikely in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that Danny does not enjoy helping people, which suggests that it brings negative consequences. The word "complications" indicates that helping others causes difficulties or problems for Danny. The other options all suggest positive outcomes, which do not fit with the negative tone of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is not satisfied with their current job and wants to make more money, implying that finding a better job with a higher salary would be the best solution. Owning a house, winning the lottery, saving money, and feeling safe may all be desirable goals, but they are not directly related to finding a way to make more money at work.
The sentence suggests that seeing beautiful clouds can evoke a particular sensation or emotion, but none of the options provided fit that description. A more appropriate option might be something like "inspired" or "enamored" as clouds can often inspire creativity or awe in people. The other options do not accurately reflect the positive experience of seeing beautiful clouds.
The question is asking where you can see animals as a human in a large northeastern city, indicating that the animals are not likely to be found roaming free. The zoo is a common place to see a variety of animals in captivity, making it the most relevant choice. The workplace, sky, and New York City do not have any clear connection to seeing animals, while "many places" is too vague to be a specific answer.
The context of the question suggests that the choices are related to activities that one would typically do in a bank. "Make noise" and "have tea" are unlikely options, as they are not related to banking activities. "Take time" could be possible, but is too generic to be the best option. "Make time" could also be possible, but it is less specific to banking activities. Therefore, "make payments" is the most appropriate answer, as it is a common activity that one would do in a bank, such as paying bills, depositing or withdrawing money, or transferring funds.
Fungus is often found growing on decaying matter, which could be a clue in choosing the correct answer. Milk is a common ingredient in cheese production, and if the cheese is left to age or become old, it is possible for fungus to grow on it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the snake prefers warm and sunny weather as its habitat. New Mexico is a southwestern state in the United States that is known for its desert climate and warm temperatures, so it is likely that this would be a suitable habitat for a snake. The other options are not likely to have the same climate features that a snake would prefer, so they can be eliminated.
The sentence states that John preferred glass, suggesting that he does not like plastic. He also wishes he was somewhere else, which implies that he is unhappy in his current environment. The option "anywhere else" best fits this context, as it implies a desire to be in a different, unspecified location. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person went to "examine" the thing, which implies an intention to gain knowledge or understanding about it. The other options such as "eat cake", "buy", "interests", and "complex" do not fit the context of examining something.
The question implies that a metal rod is a common component in a mode of transportation, and specifically in the preferred method of transportation for most people. Airplanes commonly have metal rods as part of their structure, such as the wings and the fuselage. Construction sites may also have metal rods, but they are not typically associated with transportation. Shops and broken bones are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. While engines may contain metal rods, this is not a characteristic that most people would associate with their preferred method of transportation.
The sentence suggests that the man did not have anything to put the cup on, thus indicating the need for a coaster. A coaster is an object that is often used to place a cup or glass on to protect the table or surface it is resting on. The other options, such as hands or tenacity, do not relate to the context of the sentence as they are not items that can be used to balance a cup on a table.
The context of the question implies that the person is looking for a place to purchase a glass of wine, and bars are common establishments where alcoholic beverages are served. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The context indicates that the focus is on enjoying someone's company, which is typically associated with socializing and spending time together in a non-professional setting. While some people may enjoy socializing at work or in the office, these locations are not typically associated with leisure time or relaxation. "Deep thought" is not a location at all, but rather a state of mind or activity. "Friend's house" is the only option that makes sense in the context of leisurely socializing.
The sentence suggests that Brad ordered a typical breakfast consisting of eggs and toast, which is often accompanied by a beverage such as coffee. The other options do not make sense in the context of a breakfast order, and are unlikely to be what Brad would choose to drink.
The sentence suggests that the location serves green drinks and has a locker room, which is commonly found in health clubs or gyms. Health clubs are known for offering healthy drinks and amenities such as locker rooms, saunas, and showers for members to freshen up after a workout. The other options may have a locker room, but they do not typically have green drinks or focus on health and fitness.
The sentence suggests that when humans need money, they are motivated to do something specific. The answer choice "work hard" is the most logical option, as it is commonly associated with people who need to earn money. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the sentence and are unlikely actions that people take when motivated by money.
The sentence indicates that the person referred to as Billy is not a stranger, but they haven't talked to him frequently. The phrase "known person" can encompass anyone who is not a stranger but may not necessarily be a family member or friend. The other options either do not fit or overlap with the concept of a known person.
Building a bridge requires engineering knowledge and skills, so studying engineering would be the most appropriate choice for someone who wants to learn how to build a bridge. Dancing, talking, playing the piano, and answering a question do not have any connection to bridge building.
The question suggests that the activity of reading newspapers while traveling to work is something people commonly do in a particular location. The subway is a common form of public transportation in many cities, and people often read newspapers or other materials while riding it. In contrast, reading newspapers on the front lawn or at a bookstore or library does not fit the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the janitor retrieved their bucket of sawdust from a location within the cafeteria, as they needed it to clean up the mess. A utility closet is a common location for janitorial supplies within a building such as a school cafeteria. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that doing housework can lead to a certain outcome that does not involve pain. While stress, backache, and low pay are all negative outcomes that can result from doing housework, becoming tired is a common and expected outcome. Housework can involve physical exertion and repetitive tasks, which can lead to fatigue and exhaustion. Putting on shoes is not necessarily related to housework and does not fit the context of the sentence.
The word "wet" suggests that the marmoset is already in a wet or damp environment, which would not make it happy. Therefore, we can assume that the answer must be something that will counteract the wetness and make the marmoset comfortable. Of the choices given, only a warm climate could achieve this, as it would help the marmoset dry off and regulate its body temperature. The other options (rain, France, shopping mall, great outdoors) do not address the issue of the marmoset being wet and would not necessarily make it happy.
The sentence suggests that math competitions are not primarily for students who find the subject difficult, but for those who enjoy it or find it fun. This implies that math competitions are a way for students to further engage with and challenge themselves in a subject they already enjoy, rather than a way for struggling students to improve their skills. The other options are not consistent with the idea that math competitions are primarily enjoyable or engaging for participants.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to people celebrating in a bar. Drinking alcohol is a common activity in bars, especially during celebrations, and it is not uncommon for people to drink too much and become intoxicated. Eating cake and having sex are not necessarily related to celebrating in a bar and may be uncommon activities in such a setting.
The sentence suggests that Sam is underground where there is likely no direct or full sunlight, and brightness or bright light may not be expected either. Since he is shading his eyes, it implies that he needs to adjust to a sudden change in lighting. The use of the word "unexpected" also indicates that the lighting source is not typical or commonplace, which rules out direct or full sunlight. The only option that fits this scenario is the moon, which can provide a natural but unexpected source of light in underground areas.
Children are not developmentally ready or mature enough to engage in sexual activities. Orgasm, pregnancy, and herpes do not determine who is likely or unlikely to have sex as they are related to aspects of sexual activity such as pleasure, reproduction and sexually transmitted infections. Human is not a relevant option as all humans are capable of having sex.
Committing murder is a serious and often violent act, which can cause a range of different emotions. Fear is a common emotion associated with committing murder, as the person may be afraid of getting caught or facing consequences such as going to jail. The other options do not accurately describe the emotions associated with committing murder.
The sentence suggests that the children are tired from running, which makes it unlikely that they would choose to ride a bike or play tag. Watching television and smelling smoke are not relevant options for getting somewhere. Walking is a logical choice when tired from running as it is a slower and less strenuous form of transportation.
A period is a punctuation mark used to indicate the end of a sentence. Therefore, it is likely to be on a page when a sentence is written. The other options are not related to the context of the question or the function of a period in writing.
The options "electrical circuit", "canteen", and "Mexico" are unlikely choices for getting a cup of coffee. "Coffee shop" is a possibility, but the sentence suggests a preference for a more traditional or retro atmosphere. "Diner" is a common type of restaurant that often serves classic diner fare such as coffee and pie, and is therefore the most appropriate choice for a good place to get an old fashioned cup of coffee.
The sentence suggests that the person is seeking a sensation related to breathing fresh air. "Reviving" is the most appropriate choice because it implies a sense of rejuvenation, which is often associated with taking a break from polluted environments. The other options do not accurately describe the sensation of breathing fresh air in the countryside.
The sentence suggests that the student left their writing instrument in a place where they were studying. The most likely place for a student to leave their writing instrument would be the classroom, where they were taking their classes. The other options are not likely places for a student to leave their writing instrument, as a desk drawer or pocket would require the student to remove it from their possession and a bathroom or stationery store would mean the student left the classroom entirely.
The sentence suggests that employees want to discuss something as a group, which is commonly done through a meeting. A meeting is a formal gathering where people can discuss and exchange ideas, which makes it the most appropriate option among the choices given. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as 'talk' is too vague and can suggest informal discussion, 'company' and 'corporation' refer to a business entity rather than an action or situation, and 'office' is too general and could refer to the physical space rather than a specific activity.
The sentence suggests that some people find doing housework to be a burden or something they do not enjoy, which can be described as "one big" something. The option "work" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to the context of the sentence. The other options (asthma, headache, arguments, boredom) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The scale is commonly used to weigh oneself, and it is typically kept in a private space where people can have access to it whenever they want to weigh themselves. The bathroom is the most common location for a scale as it is a private area within the home, and it is convenient for most people to use the scale after their morning routine. The other options, such as doctor's office, assay office, post office, or study, are not commonly associated with personal weighing scales.
Apple trees produce beautiful flowers before they turn into fruit. This is a well-known characteristic of apple trees and is commonly associated with them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question implies that the mail needs to be placed somewhere inside the house. The most common place to put mail that has just been brought in from outside is on a table or countertop. Placing it in the neighbor's house or post office doesn't make sense, and the fridge and bathroom are not usual places to store mail.
The sentence suggests that a grain of sand can cause pain and damage to a person's sight, which is a characteristic commonly associated with getting sand in one's eye. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Tomato sauce is a common ingredient on pizzas, making it a logical choice for the correct answer. While tomato sauce may be sold in markets and stored in refrigerators, those options don't necessarily connect to the context of the question, nor do growing tomatoes in a vegetable garden or using it in a cake.
The sentence suggests that there is a physical manifestation of someone having fun, which can be seen on their face. One common way that people express joy and happiness is through smiling, which involves the contraction of facial muscles to pull the corners of the mouth upward. The other options are not related to the physical expression of happiness or fun on someone's face.
The question is asking specifically about a meal that would be served in the evening. Brunch is typically served in the late morning or early afternoon, so it is not a correct answer. Fast food restaurant is also not a meal but rather a type of establishment. "Appear appetizing" is not a meal at all. Plate is not a meal, but rather a piece of serving ware. Therefore, the correct answer is likely dinner, which is a commonly served meal in the evening.
The sentence implies that there is something that dogs can be taught to do, which narrows down the options to those that have to do with training or behavior. "Shake hands" is a common trick that many dog owners teach their pets, making it the correct answer. "Accident" and "stray" are not related to dog behavior or training, "guard house" is not something dogs are typically trained to do, and while "drink water" is a normal behavior for a dog, it is not something they need to be taught to do.
The phrase "hair of the dog" is often used to refer to a hangover cure that involves drinking more alcohol the morning after heavy drinking. Therefore, it makes sense that the people in the sentence who love beer would refer to it as "hair of the dog." The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context or meaning of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person burped loudly with satisfaction, which suggests that they had eaten a satisfying and filling meal. The phrase "well fed" means that someone has had plenty to eat and is therefore satisfied. The other options do not provide any clear explanation for why the person would burp with satisfaction.
The question mentions that Bill is picking apples from a tree in southern Michigan. This means that the correct answer must be a location within Michigan. The other options listed are all locations in different states and are therefore incorrect.
The sentence mentions a freon coin, which is commonly used in refrigeration systems to charge the unit with coolant. This suggests that the item being discussed is related to refrigeration. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question asks about the emotions someone might feel after hurting someone else. Empowering and luck are unlikely as these are positive emotions and hurting someone else is generally considered a negative action. Punishment may be an outcome, but it is not an emotion. Despair is also possible, but regret is a more accurate answer as it is commonly understood that hurting someone else can lead to feelings of remorse and regret.
The question is asking about what a teacher does most during a week, which suggests that the answer would be related to their job responsibilities. Out of the given options, "work in school" is the most general and broad answer that would encompass a wide range of tasks a teacher may perform during a typical week, such as planning lessons, grading papers, communicating with parents or colleagues, attending meetings, etc. The other options are either too specific (demonstrate, time test, eat lunch) or too vague (school children) to accurately capture the main activities of a teacher during a week.
The question is asking specifically about pens with a company logo, which suggests that this is a promotional or business-related item. The most likely place to find such pens would be in an office, where they might be given as gifts to clients or employees or used for marketing purposes. The other options such as "on a pencil" and "backpack" are unlikely to have pens with a company logo, and the options "write sentences on paper" and "school" don't provide any context for the specific type of pen being asked about.
The question implies that the answer is a concept or intangible element that can encompass the entire world. "Thought" fits this description and suggests that the world is full of ideas and mental processes. The other options are more concrete and limited in scope. "Countries" are only a small portion of the world, "water" only covers the earth's surface, "universe" only applies to the cosmos beyond earth, and "galaxy" refers only to a specific grouping of stars.
A card catalog lists the items available in a library and is organized alphabetically by author, title, and subject. To find information in an old library, one would need to search for it in the card catalog using the author, title, or subject. Chewing, ask questions, and logic are not relevant to the process of using a card catalog to find information in a library. Time may be required, but the question specifically asks about the process of finding information in a card catalog.
The sentence suggests that Gary made a practical investment before going off to the tournament. The fact that the company is a fortune 500 company suggests that it is a well-established and profitable business. The fact that he bought a new item in addition to the stock suggests that he had some spare cash to invest in something more immediate or enjoyable. A fishing rod is a common item for someone to buy before going off on a trip, and it also fits with the idea of making a practical investment in a potentially profitable stock. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence states that fencing is a sport, which requires the use of a noun that is associated with sports. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The word "sword" is typically associated with fencing as it refers to the weapon used in the sport. A sword is a long, thin, pointed metal weapon that is used for thrusting or slashing in historical combat or modern sports like fencing.
The sentence suggests that someone is watching "garbage reality shows," which are typically broadcasted on television. The other options, such as trashcan, floor, toronto, and microwave, do not make sense in the context of watching television shows.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is visiting a foreign city and doesn't have access to their own computer. Based on this, the most logical answer would be an internet cafe, as this is a common place where people can access computers when they don't have their own. The other options, such as school, office building, and hell, do not make sense in this context. Despair is an emotional state and not a physical location.
The sentence suggests that the fire extinguisher is really big, which means it will need to be stored in a location with enough space to accommodate it. The options of school bus, car, and hospital are unlikely, as these are not typical locations for storing fire extinguishers. The stairwell may be too narrow to store a large fire extinguisher, making the garage the best option as it provides ample space and is commonly used for storage.
A basketball must be inflated with air in order to be used properly. Therefore, the options "full of air" and "round" are not correct. "Popular in America" and "not tall" do not provide any relevant information to why a basketball could not be used. The option "punctured" is the correct answer as a punctured basketball would not hold air and would be unable to bounce or be used effectively.
The question is asking for a location where an automobile can get somewhere faster than usual. The fast lane is a lane on a highway that is designated for faster-moving traffic, making it the logical choice for this question. The other options do not involve driving quickly or efficiently, such as driving on the side of the road, in a parking garage, or in a garage. Street is a possibility, but it is a broad term and does not necessarily imply speed or efficiency.
The sentence compares the college student's preference for reading during her free time with her roommates' preference for something else. The phrase "on the other hand" indicates a contrast, which suggests that the roommates' preference is different from the college student's. The most logical option based on this information is "watching tv" since it is a common leisure activity that is often done in a shared space, like a college dorm room. The options "listening" and "sleeping" do not provide enough information to infer a contrast with reading, while "illiterate" and "illiteracy" are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Wild cats are typically found in their natural habitat, which is the wilderness or nature. They are not commonly found in domestic settings like on the floor or in warm places like indoors. They may be in trouble if their habitat is threatened or if they are hunted, but this is not a general characteristic of their presence. A dog's mouth is not a suitable place for wild cats as dogs are predators and may harm the cats.
Entering school is the typical first step in becoming a student and beginning formal education. The other options do not make sense in this context - dropping out of school would mean the child is not a student, washing dishes and reading a book are not typically requirements for becoming a student, and "study book" is not a grammatically correct phrase.
A mart, supermarket, and grocery store are all places where you can take home items that need to be carried in bags. A relative's home may also give you items to take home, but it's not a public place. However, you wouldn't need a shopping bag at a restaurant unless you had leftover food that you didn't finish and wanted to take home with you. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant.
The question asks what killing is "usually thought of as", suggesting that the answer has to do with common perceptions or beliefs about the act of killing. "Premeditated" is a common legal term for when someone plans a killing in advance, and is often associated with more serious charges and penalties. The other options do not fit as well with the question, as "funeral" and "remorse" are consequences of killing rather than how it is thought of, and "horrible" and "going to jail" are more general descriptors that could apply to many things.
Learning about science is often associated with gaining knowledge and understanding of natural phenomena, laws of the universe, and technological advancements. The other options, such as headache or accidents, are not typically associated with learning science. Appreciation of nature could be a potential benefit of learning science, but it is not as direct as gaining increased knowledge. Seeing things differently may also occur, but this is not exclusive to learning science and it is not a guaranteed outcome.
The sentence implies that the introduction of industry had a broad impact on human life and society, suggesting that the correct answer relates to a significant change or development in human history. The option describing poverty is unlikely to be correct, as industrialization often leads to greater economic growth and a decline in poverty rates. The other options may be related to industry but do not fully capture the overall impact on human life and society. "Civilization" is the best answer as it suggests that the introduction of industry led to a transformation in the way humans organized themselves and created a more complex social structure.
The sentence suggests that the cat saw animal control approaching and had to make a decision. Running away is a common response for animals when they feel threatened, and the fact that the cat sees animal control approaching implies that there may be a reason for her to feel threatened. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The use of the phrase "over indulgent" suggests that the punishment for this behavior would be one of self-denial, such as practicing restraint or limiting oneself in some way. The other options all suggest external punishments imposed by others, which do not fit the context of the sentence.
Towels are commonly used at swimming pools to dry off after swimming or lounging on a poolside chair. While they could be brought to a hotel or motel, the question specifically asks for a location where the towels would be used, not just stored or brought to. The beach is another possibility, but the question implies that the towels would be brought somewhere specific, not just for general use at any beach. Stored on a towel rack is not a location where the towels would be brought, but rather where they would be stored.
The question asks what people typically do if they are near the sea, and one common activity associated with the sea is fishing. Fishing is a popular pastime for many people who live near the coast or visit the beach, and it provides a source of food and enjoyment. While some people may write stories or talk to each other near the sea, these activities are not as closely associated with the context of the question as fishing is. Additionally, the options of dying of starvation or eating fish are not valid choices, as they are not activities that people choose to do near the sea.
An army captain is a military rank, so it is natural to assume that they would be found in a military setting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. An airplane cabin may be used by many professions, but an army captain would not typically be found there. Similarly, a basketball team may have a captain, but they would not be referred to as an army captain, nor would they typically be found on a basketball team. A battleship or fleet may be associated with the military, but it is not clear that an army captain would specifically be found on a battleship or among a fleet of ships.
The question pertains to horror movies, which typically involve violence and death. The term "die" suggests that the people in question are killed, and the context of horror movies supports the idea that they are likely murdered in a violent or gruesome manner. The other options do not fit with the context of the question, since they do not pertain to horror movies or deaths.
The sentence suggests that the man has a preference for old cheese, indicating that he enjoys a stronger, more complex flavor. Cheese is known to improve with age, as the bacteria naturally present in the cheese continue to break down the fats and proteins. Additionally, certain types of cheese are intentionally aged to enhance their flavor, such as cheddar or gouda. The other options, such as "eat cake" or "salad dressing," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that the person didn't have a clean plate to eat from, so they used an alternate dish. The most common dish used as an alternative to a plate would be a bowl. Saucers are typically used as a side dish for tea or coffee, forks are an eating utensil, cups are used for drinking, and food is not a dish, but rather what is being eaten.
Garlic is well-known for causing a strong odor in the breath, especially when consumed raw or in high quantities. Therefore, the sentence suggests that eating garlic for breakfast could lead to bad breath. The other options are not relevant to the context and do not have any connection to the effects of garlic consumption.
The sentence suggests that the mountain was part of a larger geographical feature, which is described as "surrounding" something else. The only option that fits this description is "plains". The other options do not convey the idea of a surrounding geographical feature. A "molehill" is too small, a "field" is not high enough, a "dale" is a valley rather than a feature that surrounds something, and while mountains can create climbing challenges, this option does not fit with the surrounding context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the class was meant to help individuals improve themselves, which is often associated with meditation practices. The instructor specifically asks everyone to close their eyes, which is a common practice during meditation. The other answer choices do not align with the sentence's context, as celebrating or plotting destruction would not typically be associated with self-improvement, and eating better and feeling better about oneself do not relate specifically to the action of closing one's eyes.
The sentence suggests that a hinged door is commonly found in most rooms of a house or building, except for one specific room. The options "jamb" and "own house" do not refer to a specific room, while "kitchen" and "building" are common places where hinged doors are found. However, washing machines usually do not have hinged doors but rather a front-loading or top-loading configuration, making it the correct answer.
Blowfish are a type of fish that are typically found in saltwater environments, such as oceans and coral reefs. Coral reefs provide blowfish with ample protection from predators while also offering a variety of food sources, making it an ideal habitat for them. The other choices do not offer the necessary environment for a blowfish to survive, as they are not found in palm trees, books, fish markets, or aquariums in the wild.
Footprints would not typically be left on a carpet or rug if they were worn by a person's shoes. The surface of the earth includes various environments where footprints could be left, such as in mud, sand, or snow. However, the question specifies "man-made item," so this choice is less likely. The ground is a vague term and does not specifically refer to a man-made object. However, footprints could be left on a flat or sloped surface, such as a roof.
The sentence suggests that there is some kind of action that a country can take out of jealousy that a person cannot. Given the context of the phrase "jealousy," it is reasonable to assume that the action is negative or aggressive in nature. Therefore, "wage war" is the most likely correct answer, as countries have historically gone to war based on feelings of jealousy towards other nations. The other options do not have a strong connection to jealousy or aggressive behavior.
Attending school is commonly associated with improving one's education and skillset, which in turn can increase their employability or ability to obtain a job. The other options, such as dropping out or catching a cold, do not have any clear correlation to the benefits of attending school. Getting paid may be a result of attending school and obtaining qualifications, but it is not a direct benefit. Graduating is a potential outcome of attending school, but it doesn't encompass all the benefits of education.
The phrase "back garden" is a term commonly used in British English to refer to the yard or garden at the back of a house. Therefore, the answer is likely to be related to an area in which this term is frequently used, such as suburban neighborhoods in England. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the children enjoyed the movie and started to play a game of pretending to be characters from the movie. The word "pretend" is used in the sentence to indicate this game. The other options, such as "cry," "go to movie," "stand in line," and "wait in line," do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence is referring to a feature that is found on all mammal skin, and the choices provided all relate to different features that can be found on the skin or within the body. Nipples, for example, are not found on all mammal skin, while spinal cords are not a feature of the skin at all. Fur and hair are both features that can be found on many mammals, but the sentence specifies that only one is correct. In this case, hair is the correct answer as it is commonly found on all mammal skin, while fur is a type of hair that is specific to certain animals.
A potluck is an event where everyone brings a dish of food to share with others. The emphasis is on communal sharing and everyone contributes to the meal. Therefore, the correct answer is share food. The other choices do not fit the context of potlucks.
The sentence indicates that the investor had promised profit but did not deliver. Instead, the investor was "losing" money, which implies that they were experiencing a decline in their investments. The other choices, such as "lost" or "losses," also suggest a decline in investments but do not necessarily convey the ongoing nature of the problem that is implied by "losing money." "Expense" and "lose money" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that someone might still be able to learn even if they don't continue going to school. Continuing to learn is a lifelong process that can happen outside of formal schooling, through reading, exploring new hobbies, or even just talking to other people. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Triangles are a common shape studied in geometry, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects in space. While mathematics and math class are broad terms that could potentially include geometry, they do not specifically identify the use of triangles. Math book and university are also too broad and do not provide any specific information related to triangles.
Going to space requires the use of specialized vehicles, such as rockets or space shuttles, that are designed to launch spacecraft into orbit. The other options are not suitable for space travel and do not have any connection to the context of the question.
Listening involves actively paying attention to what someone else is saying, processing the information, and responding appropriately. Simply being able to hear someone's words is not enough to be considered listening. Being very quiet can be helpful in listening, but it is not the skill itself. "Shut up" is inappropriate and implies not allowing someone to speak, which is the opposite of listening. "Hatred" has no connection to the question at hand.
The statement suggests that the purpose of the product was not related to selling but instead related to demonstrating something. Products that are used for demonstrations are often given away for free or not intended for sale. The other choices do not fit the context of the statement, as they do not provide any information about the purpose of the product.
Hospitals are typically located in urban areas, which would eliminate options like every state, military base, and doctor. Detroit is a specific city and may not be a representative answer, leaving most cities as the most likely choice.
The sentence suggests that there is a distinction between being in your home country and being in another country. The word "not" indicates that the answer should be the opposite of "home country." "Foreign" is the only option that describes being in another country, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions "children" and "bicycles," which suggests a school setting. The word "leave" implies temporary storage rather than permanent parking, which makes "schoolyard" the most logical choice. "Street" and "behind" are unlikely options for a safe place to store bicycles. "Netherlands" and "university" are not mentioned in the sentence and do not provide any context for the answer.
The question is asking for something that a computer is unable to do, so we need to eliminate any choices that are possible for a computer to do. A computer is capable of processing information and making decisions, so those options can be eliminated. Computers also cannot cast shadows, but this is not necessarily a defining characteristic of what a computer cannot do. However, becoming sensible is something that is exclusive to humans and cannot be replicated by computers or machines. Therefore, the correct answer is "become sensible."
Standing up typically requires the use of one's legs and feet to push upwards. Balance and effort may be important factors in maintaining stability and exerting force, but they are not the primary physical components involved in standing up. Hands and courage are not relevant to the physical act of standing up.
The question is asking where to put a teaspoon when it is not in use, which suggests a storage location. None of the other options are for storage, and "in mouth" and "eating" suggest actively using the teaspoon. "Cup of coffee" and "coffee cup" may be where a teaspoon would be located during use, but not where it would be stored when not in use. Therefore, the correct answer is "kitchen drawer."
The sentence suggests that lighting a candle can help create a romantic atmosphere, and the choice of "dimly lit room" fits this context best. A dimly lit room can create a cozy and intimate atmosphere, which is often associated with romance. The other options, such as a synagogue or birthday cake, do not have the same association with romantic settings.
Since the question is asking where you wouldn't find a grape, the answer is likely to be a place where grapes are not typically found. While grapes are often used in cooking, they are not typically found in a kitchen on their own. Grapes come from fields or vineyards, and they are usually sold at fruit stands or used in wineries. They may also be served on a plate as a snack or part of a meal, but they would not be found in a kitchen unless someone had brought them in from another location.
The sentence suggests that the person is excited to be in a region that actually has snow, which indicates that they may come from a place where it doesn't snow often or at all. The word "winter" is synonymous with snow and is the only option that directly relates to the idea of snow. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
A window is typically placed on a wall in a house to allow natural light to come in and provide a view of the outside. Restrooms and classrooms may have windows, but they are often smaller or higher up and serve different purposes. Building and space shuttle may have windows, but they are not relevant to the context of a house.
The sentence suggests that the activity of working in a vegetable garden happens in a specific location. The phrase "everyday" also suggests that this location is accessible and convenient. The term "backyard" is the only choice that fits this criteria, while the other options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
The fact that the bus stop implemented a size restriction for luggage suggests that it is a stop for a mode of transportation that involves air travel. Airports often have restrictions on the size and weight of luggage that passengers can bring on their flights. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Laughter is often associated with humor or something that is funny. If something surprising is also funny, it can cause someone to laugh. The other options (fight, accidents, bad news, frightened) do not typically elicit laughter as a response.
The sentence indicates that the person being referred to retired from a command post after serving for twenty years. "Serve" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as it suggests that the person was in a leadership position and fulfilled their duties for a significant amount of time before deciding to retire. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as they do not suggest a leadership or command position.
The sentence suggests that the person is having a positive experience seeing new things, which implies that they are feeling something positive. Fear and anger do not align with a positive experience, while curiosity and wonder may be neutral or positive, but excitement is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a high level of positive emotion and energy.
An empty dish is usually stored in the kitchen cabinet, which is a designated space for storing dishes and other kitchenware. The other options such as restaurant, pantry, table, and glass are not typical locations for storing empty dishes in a household setting.
The sentence suggests that two people are about to return to work, and it implies that there is something they might do beforehand. Of the options given, "conversation" makes the most sense, as it is a common activity people engage in before going back to work. Anxiety, depression, and fighting are negative actions that people wouldn't want to be doing before going back to work, and earning money doesn't make sense in the context given.
The fact that James bought a hide bed sofa suggests that he is living in a space where efficiency is important, such as an apartment. Typically, people living in houses or villages have more space and do not have to prioritize space efficiency in their furniture choices. Similarly, someone living in a hotel would not have a need for a hide bed sofa, as their accommodations are usually temporary. While some beach condos also have limited space, the context of the sentence does not provide any indication that James is specifically living in a beach condo.
A bicycle is most likely to be safe in a garage because it is a secure and enclosed space where the bike can be protected from theft and weather damage. Sidewalks and streets are public areas where a bike can be easily stolen or damaged. Schoolyards may also be secure, but they are not always accessible to the general public. Toy stores are unlikely to have a safe space for a bike.
The sentence implies that children can learn about science in a fun way through a specific activity, and the term "experiment" is often associated with science education. Science experiments can be engaging and encourage curiosity and exploration, which may lead to excitement and enjoyment for children. The other options, such as "time," "frustration," and "become educated," do not directly relate to a fun way for children to learn about science.
The context of the sentence suggests that Sarah fell asleep while watching the movie. The sentence indicates that she missed the middle and that she closed her eyes in the beginning, indicating that she may have been tired or bored. The other options are not supported by the context of the sentence and are inappropriate in this context.
Prolonged use of computers can cause strain and pain in the hands, wrists, and arms, leading to a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. This is caused by repetitive motions such as typing, and is a common issue in people who spend a lot of time using computers. The other options do not have any clear connection to the possible effects of computer use on the human body.
An enclosed shelf is more likely to be found in a cabinet than any of the other options. A cabinet is a piece of furniture that typically has one or more doors and shelves, and can be used for storage. It is common for cabinets to have enclosed shelves, as this helps to protect items from dust and other environmental factors. The other options do not necessarily have any connection to enclosed shelves.
Dark clouds are often associated with rain because they are an indication of a buildup of moisture in the atmosphere. As the clouds become heavier with moisture, they are more likely to release it in the form of rain. The other options, such as cloud vision or rain water, do not make as much sense in the context of the question. Weather might also be a correct answer in some contexts, but the specific phrasing of the question ("What are dark clouds likely to do?") suggests a more specific answer related to precipitation.
The sentence suggests that shallow water, regardless of being clean and chlorinated, would not be ideal for summer fun in a backyard. The word "shallow" implies that the body of water is not very deep and may be small, which rules out options like lakes and ponds. "Children's pools" and "swimming pools" may be too large or too expensive for a typical backyard. Therefore, the best option is "puddle," which is a small, shallow body of water that could occur naturally or from rainfall.
The question is asking about a privilege that is specific to being an adult. Of the choices given, only "marry" is a privilege that is typically only available to adults. Dressing oneself, drinking beer, working, and driving a train are not inherently privileges reserved solely for adults. While certain jobs may require a minimum age for employment, they are not privileges in the same way that the legal ability to marry is.
The question is asking for the location of a sofa outside of the person's own residence, which suggests that the sofa is likely to be located in another nearby dwelling. The most logical answer would be the neighbor's house, as it is a common place for a person to access furniture that is not in their own home. The other options are less likely because they are either too specific (person's living room, livingroom) or not related to the context of the question (White House, home).
The use of an "anger bar" suggests that the video game involves combat or some form of conflict. The purpose of charging up the anger bar is likely to increase the player's ability to engage in combat and defeat the enemy. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence or the concept of an anger bar in video games.
Falling from a height can definitely result in pain and broken bones, as the impact of the fall puts a significant amount of force on the body. Diving and going down do not necessarily suggest a fall from a height, and injuries could refer to a wide range of potential outcomes without specifying the likelihood of pain and/or broken bones.
The sentence suggests that there is a contrast between the bright, populated city and a location with a smaller population. The options "suburbs", "town", and "countryside" are all areas that typically have a higher population density than the wilderness. "Outside" is too vague to be a clear answer. Therefore, the correct answer is "wilderness," which is an area typically defined by its lack of human populations and bright city lights.
The context of the question implies that the answer should pertain to a location where one can purchase apples. While apples can be obtained from a variety of sources, the options "table" and "fridge" do not make sense in this context. "Farmers market" may be a valid option, but the use of the word "typically" suggests that it is not as common as the option "grocery store". Finally, "apple tree" is not a plausible answer as it is a source of apples rather than a place to purchase them.
Comparison shopping refers to the practice of researching and comparing prices of products across different stores or online platforms before making a purchase. This method allows the buyer to find the best deal or price for the product they want. Bankruptcy and loss of money are not relevant to finding the best price, while overstocking and playing games do not describe a practical method for buying products.
ights were prominent during the Middle Ages, a time period known for its chivalry and codes of honor. Therefore, it is likely that a knight would be depicted as a hero in literature or events related to this time period. Castle may also be a possible answer, as many knights lived in castles and defended them from invaders. Renaissance festival and chess set have no clear connection to knights or heroism in this context, while historical novel is too vague to determine a specific answer.
Steel is a versatile building material that can be used for a variety of structures, from small buildings to skyscrapers and large industrial facilities like automobile factories. It is also a common material for bridges due to its strength and durability. Therefore, all of the options listed could potentially be constructed using steel. However, it's worth noting that the size of the house may be too small to warrant the use of steel.
Evening refers to the time period between sunset and bedtime, which means it starts after daytime has ended. Dawn is the time period before sunrise, early morning is the time period after sunrise but before midday, and night is the time period after evening and before sunrise. Sunset marks the end of the daytime, so evening cannot come before it.
The sentence suggests that stretching out the socks will change their fit. Stretching something typically results in it becoming larger or more spacious, so it is likely that the socks will have a looser fit after being stretched. The other options do not make sense in the context of sock stretching.
The sentence suggests that when meeting a friend over coffee, there is a common activity that is likely to occur. The best option that fits this context is "talk," as getting together with a friend over coffee is typically an opportunity to catch up and have a conversation. The other options, such as "excitement," "joy," "abuse," and "panic" do not have any clear connection to the context of meeting a friend over coffee.
The context suggests that there were multiple speakers present, which is a common occurrence at conferences. A drive-in movie, shelf, lecture hall or demonstration would not typically involve multiple speakers in the same way as a conference.
The sentence indicates that the child was unable to lift the box due to its weight, so the correct answer would be an option that refers to weight or density. "Toxic" and "isolated from sulphide pbs" do not provide any information about the weight of the box. "Light" is the opposite of what the sentence is describing. "Very dense" could be a possible answer, but since the sentence specifies that the child couldn't lift it, "very heavy" is a more precise option.
The context of the sentence suggests that the person is buying tickets for a show or movie. The term "ticket booth" is commonly associated with movie theaters, where patrons pay for tickets to watch a film. The other options, such as sports arenas, auditoriums, operas, and metro stations, do not typically have ticket booths for events related to movies or shows.
The phrase "bringing suit" is often used in the legal context to refer to the act of suing someone in court. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to legal proceedings. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
When fishing, the end of the fishing line is typically where a fish is hooked and caught. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of fishing.
Lizards are cold-blooded creatures, which means they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. By lying on a rock in the sun, they can absorb the warmth of the sun's rays and raise their body temperature to an optimal level. The other options may also be applicable to areas where lizards are commonly found, but they do not provide a direct explanation for why a lizard would lay on a rock in the sun.
The context of the sentence implies that if you poke yourself with a sharp knitting needle, you will start bleeding. Bleeding is a common response to puncture wounds caused by sharp objects, such as needles. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Billy needed to borrow a stepladder in order to reach the high shelf. The most logical place for Billy to find a stepladder would be in a store room where tools and equipment are kept. The other options, such as a tool shed, hardware store, construction worker's vehicle, or library, may also have stepladders, but they are not the most likely places for Billy to have found one in the context of the sentence.
The question suggests that ships have some benefit when there is no bridge available, which implies that they can be used to cross a body of water. The other options, such as colliding or bottoming out, do not make sense as benefits of ships. Carrying people and sailors may be related to ships, but those options do not directly answer the question.
The context of the sentence suggests that the location being described is specifically intended for young children who are just starting their education. Out of the given options, a preschool would be the most appropriate place for this. Playgrounds, big houses, buildings, and grandma's house do not necessarily have the same educational focus as a preschool.
Phonebooks are typically used to list phone numbers of individuals and businesses, making them the most likely source for finding someone's number written on paper. The other options, such as a math book, mathematics, office, or lottery, do not have any clear association with written phone numbers.
The word "paper" in this context likely refers to documents or files, and cabinets are commonly used to store and organize such items. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that water rapids that are choppy are being described. The word "dangerous" would be a fitting description for rapids that are choppy, as choppy rapids can be more difficult to navigate and pose a greater risk to those who are trying to navigate them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "solidity" suggests that the building lacks a sense of substance or physical density. Since the opposite of solidity is hollowness, this means that the building is empty or has a lack of material inside. The other options do not make logical sense in the context of a building lacking solidity, as instability and weakness are related to structural integrity and openness is related to space or lack thereof.
The sentence suggests that the reason why humans invented sports may have something to do with an instinctual need or drive. The options "recreational, good looking, fun, and violent" do not seem to have any direct connection to this idea. However, the option "competitive" makes sense because sports are often organized around some form of competition or contest, whether it be between individuals or teams. Additionally, human beings are known to be competitive by nature, which may explain why sports have become such a prominent aspect of many cultures worldwide.
A map is a visual representation of an area or region, often including details such as roads, landmarks, and geographical features. It is commonly used to plan and navigate routes for travelling. An atlas is a collection of maps, and while it could be used for this purpose, it is not as practical for quick reference as a single map. The post office is not typically associated with travel planning or navigation. "Get to a specific place" and "phone" are not items that are used directly to figure out the best route for travelling.
When there is a source of light behind an object such as a tree, it is likely to cast a shadow in the opposite direction. This is because the object blocks some or all of the light, depending on its size and thickness. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question; for example, providing shelter or branch out are not related to the behavior of light and shadows.
The sentence suggests that the child used a utensil to scratch the plate, which most commonly would be a fork. While it is possible to scratch a plate with other utensils like a spoon or knife, using a fork is the most likely scenario based on the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context.
These are all common sources for accessing news and information on current events. Books typically offer historical perspectives and analysis rather than breaking news coverage.
The sentence suggests that the teacher's main job is to help students learn and commit to memory new skills. While memorization may be a part of the learning process, it is not the primary goal of the teacher. The other options are not directly related to the main job of a teacher in the classroom.
The sentence is too vague to provide any clear hints as to which answer would be correct. Depending on the context or topic under discussion, any of the options could be a valid and reasonable choice. Without additional information, it is impossible to discern which one is the intended or best answer.
Playing guitar involves creating music, which makes "making music" the most likely answer. While playing guitar may lead to singing or songwriting, these are not necessarily direct results of playing the instrument. Arthritis is a possible side effect of playing guitar, but it is not a typical outcome of playing. Listening to music might be a general interest of someone who is inclined to play the guitar, but it is not specific to the activity of playing itself.
The sentence implies that the houses are difficult to sell because of something that the former tenant did inside them. The use of the word "shoot" suggests that the activity was related to filming. The option "pornography" fits this criteria, as it is a commonly filmed activity that could make potential buyers uncomfortable with the property. The other options do not relate to an activity that would make a house difficult to sell.
The sentence suggests that there are only a limited number of options for places to stay in a particular location. This would be more likely to occur in a smaller town rather than a city, where there would be more lodging options available. Mexico and a holiday are not specific enough to provide a clear answer, while a phone book is irrelevant to the question.
The context of the sentence implies that the bone is found in a burial context, as it is wrapped in cloth. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "tomb," as it is the only option that pertains to a burial site. The other options, such as "museum" or "hospital," do not have any clear connection to the context of finding a bone wrapped in cloth.
Locking your knees while standing for an extended period of time can cause a decrease in blood flow to the brain, resulting in fainting. This is known as vasovagal syncope, a condition that can occur in people who tend to have low blood pressure or are dehydrated. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of standing in line or locking your knees.
Tidepools are shallow depressions in rock formations located near the shore that are filled with seawater. They are known for being habitats for small aquatic organisms, such as crabs, starfish, and anemones. This makes them a popular spot for beachcombing and exploring during low tide. The other options are less likely to have crabs, with the cooking pot being a tool for cooking them, beach sand being too exposed, the Chesapeake Bay being too large, and the fish market being a place to buy them rather than find them.
The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is attending a trade show, which typically includes booths and exhibits showcasing various products and services. In this context, a "demonstration" is the most likely activity a spectator would watch, as companies may showcase their products in action or explain their benefits through live presentations. The other options - sporting event, racing, show, and watch event - are not typically associated with trade shows.
The sentence implies that the party animals were drinking for a prolonged period of time, starting in the evening and ending at a later time. The only option that fits this time frame is "night," as it occurs after dusk and before dawn. The other options all refer to earlier times in the day and do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is not used to getting up early, and as a result, has developed bloodshot eyes. Bloodshot eyes are a common symptom of sleep deprivation or tiredness, which may explain why the person needed drops to clear up their eyes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking specifically about where people store their plastic cutlery. While "store" could be interpreted as a possible answer, it is too generic and could apply to any type of storage. The other options, such as "everything" or "clothes closet," have no connection to the context of the question. "Cupboard" is the most likely answer as it is a common storage location for utensils and dishes in a kitchen setting.
The sentence implies that there is a specific gallery being discussed, and that it is likely focused on art since many features are on display. Art museums are commonly known to showcase a variety of different works of art, which could explain why many features are displayed there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The phrase "bringing people to the table" is often used metaphorically to refer to a person's ability to bring different parties together to negotiate or collaborate. In this context, it is unlikely that the person's success is based on their culinary skills or ability to acquire wealth. Therefore, the most likely answer is that they are skilled at making people feel valued and appreciated, which is often done through the use of compliments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a shopping bag, which is commonly provided at a place where you can shop for groceries and other goods. Supermarkets are known for providing customers with shopping bags to carry their purchases. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a location where you can play bowling. A bowling alley is a common place where people play this game, and a lane is a specific section of the alley where you throw the ball towards the pins. The other options, such as city, basketball court, rural countryside, or highway, are not relevant to the context of the sentence and have no connection to playing bowling.
Libraries are typically associated with quiet and peaceful environments, as people go there to read and study. Therefore, it is unlikely that excitement would be allowed in a library, as it could disturb other patrons. The other options are all associated with events or activities where excitement is expected or encouraged. For example, hockey games and boxing matches are known for their action and physicality, while car shows and dances provide opportunities for socializing and having fun.
The question states that female ants don't have wings, which limits how they can move around. This suggests that they must rely on other methods of locomotion, such as crawling. The other choices don't necessarily have a direct connection to the fact that female ants don't have wings, and therefore do not make sense in this context.
When going on vacation and taking a book, it would make most sense to store it in a suitcase, which is a common item used for packing personal belongings while traveling. The other options such as classroom, book store, and synagogue do not have any relation to the context of taking a book on vacation, while the briefcase is more commonly associated with carrying work-related documents and items rather than personal leisure items like books.
The sentence suggests that the cowboy was enjoying his experience "atop the bull," which implies that he was participating in a rodeo or similar event. The phrase "wild ride" is commonly associated with rodeos, where cowboys attempt to stay on bucking bulls for as long as possible. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The word "ride" suggests that the answer must be related to an attraction or amusement, and the context of the sentence implies that the ride is intended to bring enjoyment or pleasure to visitors. The word "fun" best fits this description, as it is often associated with activities intended to be entertaining or enjoyable. The other options may also be desirable outcomes, but they do not fit as well with the specific context of the sentence.
The question is asking where on the upper body people want to remove hair, which suggests that the answer is a body part. The only option that is a body part is the arm, which is commonly shaved or waxed by both men and women. The other options, such as mammals, person's head, mammoth trunk, and sink, have no connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that the animals were not thirsty, which implies that they did not need to drink water from the river. Instead, passing water (urination) could be a biological process that naturally occurs when animals are near water sources. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - feeling pain, flying, dying of cancer, and feeling pleasure are not actions that can be attributed to animals in this particular scenario.
The sentence implies that the parents are encouraging the children to play for a specific outcome. Given the context, it's likely that the desired outcome is related to the parents' enjoyment or relaxation (since they are not specified). Being entertained fits this the best, as playing is a common way for children to engage in fun activities that can be enjoyable for adults to watch or participate in. The other options (spending money, intermission, weight loss, sleepiness) do not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the fear of A.I. is related to job displacement, which is a common concern associated with technological advancements. Fear of losing the ability to work is a common theme in discussions about A.I., as it is expected to replace many jobs that are currently performed by humans. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Cider is often made from apples, which are typically grown in orchards. Bees are known to be attracted to the sweet scent of apple cider, so it would be wise to be careful of them in an orchard where there may be beehives. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that Sally hired people for a specific purpose, and that purpose was related to entertainment. The phrase "that was what she expected" suggests that the people she hired were doing what they were supposed to do. The only choice that makes sense in this context is "getting paid for," as it suggests that Sally expected the people she hired to provide entertainment as part of their job. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence explicitly states that John was a servant, meaning he likely did tasks or work for someone else. None of the other choices align with the description of a servant, as they imply a higher level of authority or freedom.
The sentence mentions that the person lived on the tenth storey of a walk-up, which suggests that they lived in a tall, multi-story building. The options "skyscraper," "tall building," and "apartment building" all fit this description, but "skyscraper" implies a more grandiose building than the others, and "tall building" is too generic. "Book of stories" and "mall" have nothing to do with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most likely answer is "apartment building."
The question refers to a common tradition in many parts of the world where confetti is thrown from rooftops during New Year's Eve celebrations. This tradition is often associated with big cities where crowds gather and party in the streets to welcome the new year. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The Queen knighted Dan, which is an act reserved for those who are considered worthy of honor and recognition. This suggests that the Queen believed Dan was deserving of this honor and did not think he was bad. The other options do not necessarily imply that someone is deserving of such an honor.
The presence of an attendant at the door suggests that this situation is taking place in a public space, like a theater, where it would be important to keep light out during a show. The other options (building, office, neighbor's house, funeral) don't fit the context of a premiere night for a show.
A clock is a tool used to keep track of time, so the answer choice that best relates to its purpose is "tell time." The other choices are not related to the function of a clock.
The sentence suggests that Sean was afraid of something happening to his door, specifically that it might open. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The question specifically mentions "group projects," which implies that multiple people are working together towards a common goal. Working in teams is a common and effective way to approach group projects as it allows for individuals to draw on each other's strengths and collaborate to achieve the best outcome. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
A welcome mat is typically placed in front of the entrance of a house to greet guests as they enter. Therefore, the correct answer would be "doorway." The other options do not have any connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that there are other consequences of sex besides procreation. Since the question is asking for what is even more common than kids, we can eliminate twins and children born as options. The mention of venereal disease and used condoms suggest potential negative consequences of sex, but they are not necessarily more common than pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy is the most logical answer to the question.
The sentence suggests that a group of people are waiting at a certain location before they are taken away, which is a common scenario at a bus stop. Bus stops are often used as a meeting point for people waiting to take public transportation, and they can be found in various locations such as urban areas or outside of city limits. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a mattress that is both soft and firm. Although "hard" and "harsh" are also opposites of "soft," they do not make sense in the context of a mattress as they would be uncomfortable to sleep on. "Loud" and "hexachord" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence indicates that Sam did not care about the company he kept on Christmas, suggesting that being alone was the primary concern. The options solitude and loneliness also suggest being alone, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence. The option he wants to marry is not relevant to the sentence and appears to be a non-sequitur. The option you is not relevant as it is not clear who "you" refers to in the sentence.
The question is asking about the requirement for buying something, which is spending money. The other options may be related to the act of buying, but they do not represent the actual requirement for purchasing something. Going shopping may mean browsing or looking at items, but it does not necessarily imply buying. Paying may be part of the process of buying, but it does not encompass the entire action. Having something in mind is a personal preference, but it does not necessarily mean that one will buy it. A shop is simply a place where one can buy things, but it does not represent the action of buying itself.
The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where multiple merchants can operate their stores together. In this context, a mall is a common term used for a large indoor shopping center that houses many stores under one roof. The other options may also have multiple stores, but they do not necessarily imply that these stores are in a shared space or under one roof.
Copy machines are commonly found in workplaces, such as offices, where people need to print and copy documents. The other options, such as barns, museums, assembly lines, and kitchens, do not typically require a copy machine, which makes them unlikely locations for one to be found.
When the body gets too warm, it activates its sweat glands to release sweat, which then evaporates on the skin to cool down the body. Sweating is the body's natural response to excess heat and helps regulate body temperature. Feeling guilty, sleeping, feeling more comfortable, and cuddling do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The question asks about how kids can learn new things, which implies that the answer should involve a method of acquiring knowledge. Asking questions is a common way for children to learn new things, as they are naturally curious and seek answers to their inquiries. The other options do not have a clear connection to the task of learning new things, such as driving, which is not typically a skill that children can develop at a young age.
The phrase "steep learning curve" suggests that skateboarding may be difficult to learn at first, but once you master the basics, you can enjoy the activity and have fun. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence implies that music is being played in a communal setting, which suggests that the correct answer must be a location where music is performed publicly. The options "elevator," "cassettes," and "store" are unlikely choices because they do not provide a public space for enjoying music. While music can be enjoyed at an opera, not all operas allow public access. A theatre, however, is a public venue where music performances are frequently held, making it the best choice for the answer.
The sentence mentions James wanting to add space for an extra guest, indicating that he already has a place to accommodate guests. The options hotel and guest room are already mentioned in the sentence are not relevant. The mention of buying a hide bed sofa suggests that James has limited space in his living quarters and opted for a multifunctional furniture item. Therefore, the most likely option is an apartment or a small house where space is limited. The option office does not make sense in this context.
The sentence suggests that the crab is feeling cold, which implies that it is in an environment with low temperatures. The only option that fits this description is the fridge freezer, which is a common household item used for storing food at low temperatures. The other options, such as the Gulf of Mexico, fish market, grocery store, and North Sea, do not have any clear connection to the idea of a cold environment.
The question is asking where someone can get sports equipment if they do not have any. Out of the given options, a sporting goods store is the most likely place to have a wide variety of sports equipment available for purchase or rent. Sears is a department store that may sell some sports equipment but not as specialized as a sporting goods store. A pool is a location and not a place to buy sports equipment. A sporting event is not typically a place to acquire equipment, and a school may have limited resources and may not have a variety of equipment available.
The phrase "everyone's goal" suggests that the answer is something universally desirable. The phrase "having sex long" may mean engaging in sexual activity for a prolonged period of time, but it could also be interpreted as wanting to have fulfilling sexual experiences over a long period of time. The options "sell beer," "herpes," and "cost money" have no clear connection with the context of the sentence, leaving "wonderful thing" and "last hour" as the possible answers. Based on the positive tone of the sentence, "wonderful thing" is the more likely option.
Hoboken is a city in the state of New Jersey, so the correct answer would be "new jersey". The other options listed do not have any connection to Hoboken or its location.
Driving on the left is a practice commonly associated with countries that were once part of the British Empire, such as Australia and India. England is a well-known example of a country where people drive on the left, including on motorways. The other options, such as Europe or a river, are too broad or unrelated to the context and do not provide any specific information to guide the answer. New Jersey and city are also incorrect choices as they are not countries but specific regions or places within the United States.
The word "centavo" is commonly used to refer to a subdivision of the Mexican peso, which is the currency of Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Silk is often associated with Chinese culture and is commonly sold in stores in Chinatown neighborhoods. Expensive clothing and garments may not necessarily be made of silk, and downtown is too broad a location to determine where silk might be sold. Nightgown is a type of clothing made from silk, but it does not provide any information on where it might be bought.
The sentence suggests that zoning rules prevented Sally from carrying out her plans to remodel her front garden. Zoning rules generally apply in urban areas, where there are regulations on how homes and properties may be used. None of the other options in the answer choices mention zoning rules or have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The context suggests that the setting is probably a location where fox hunting is common, but the weather is too dry for it to be a successful endeavor. New Hampshire has a history of fox hunting, but also experiences dry periods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the general store was located in a place where other shops were also present, indicating that it was part of a larger complex. This is most commonly associated with a shopping mall, where multiple stores are located in close proximity to each other for convenience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The reception desk is typically the first point of contact for guests when they arrive at a hotel. It functions as a central information point and is responsible for handling check-ins, reservations, and guest inquiries. Since the reception desk is a mainstay in the hospitality industry, it is typically positioned in the lobby of the hotel, where it can be easily accessed by arriving guests. The other options do not provide a suitable location for the reception desk.
The first sentence implies that Sarah has grown up and is no longer a child. The second sentence suggests that she had difficulty buying new clothes, which could mean that she outgrew her old clothes and needed to purchase larger sizes. "Large" is the most appropriate choice among the options given, as it directly relates to size. The other options do not provide any relevant information about Sarah's clothing size.
The sentence suggests that the plant did not do well in the shade, which implies that it requires more light to thrive. Direct sunlight is a term commonly used to describe an area that receives unobstructed sunlight, which would provide the plant with the necessary light it needs to grow. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Using a boat in an ocean requires significant navigation skills as it is a vast body of water with various factors that could affect the course, such as currents, wind direction, and waves. A river, on the other hand, may have a more straightforward flow, making it easier to navigate. Garage and boattail do not have any connection to water, while Indiana is a state and not a body of water.
The man needed a toothbrush and some food, which suggests that he was looking for a place that sells basic necessities like toiletries and groceries. The drug store and dentist office are more likely to sell dental hygiene products but may not have groceries. The mouth and attic are not places where one would buy toothbrushes and food. The grocery store is the most appropriate place for the man to have gone.
The sentence suggests that Janet enjoys dancing because it gives her a specific feeling. The words "swaying" and "music" imply that she is experiencing a pleasurable sensation while dancing. The word "euphoria" means a feeling of intense happiness or excitement, which fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence or would not be a desirable feeling to experience while dancing.
Supermarket boxes are primarily used for organization purposes. They are designed to hold and display various products on shelves or carts, and make it easier for customers to locate what they need. While some boxes may be used to store food items, the primary function is to keep the store shelves organized and tidy. Storage of clothes is not typically associated with supermarket boxes.
A chandelier is typically associated with larger and more formal spaces, such as grand buildings, ballrooms, or hotels. A foyer also suggests an entrance area to a larger structure, rather than a smaller one like an apartment or a spacious house. While a mansion could also be a possibility, the term "building" is the most general and inclusive option, encompassing all types of structures where a chandelier might be found.
The sentence suggests that James wants to keep his hot tub private and not share it with his neighbors. The phrase "turn his house into" implies that his fear is about his house becoming something undesirable due to the hot tub being public knowledge. Out of the choices given, "country club" makes the most sense as it is a type of exclusive club that has facilities such as pools and hot tubs that are only available to members. The other options, such as "health center" or "hospital," do not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a winding mountain, which suggests that they were driving on a road. The phrase "pulled off to the shoulder" is usually associated with vehicles stopping on the side of a road. The other options, such as torso, garment, cello, and body, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The question is asking where you can keep your plane ticket in your shirt, suggesting that there is a specific location on your shirt to store your ticket. The most common location for storing small items like tickets is in a pocket, which is why this is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question and are unlikely places to store a plane ticket.
The question suggests that the pictures being referred to have a story, which is a characteristic commonly associated with books. Books often contain visual images, such as illustrations or photographs, alongside a narrative or descriptive text to tell a story. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
The sentence suggests that James used a blanket from his own personal belongings to cover the burn marks on the floor. The options "synagogue," "table," "carpet," and "general store" are unlikely sources for a blanket in this context, as they do not have any clear connection to James or his home.
The sentence suggests that Sarah made a poor decision and ended up experiencing negative consequences. Specifically, it suggests that she may have been caught using a fake ID while attempting to purchase beer, which would likely result in being arrested. The other options do not fit the context provided and do not match the tone of the sentence.
The word "chief" is commonly associated with a leadership position within a company or organization. The word "employee" suggests that the chief oversees the people who work for the company. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was caused by the man's mustache, which implies that it is a physical trait that is visually appealing to her. This suggests that the answer is related to attraction or desire, rather than more general positive emotions like joyfulness or enthusiasm. The use of the word "flirting" also supports the idea that there is a mutual attraction or interest between the two individuals.
When solving a math problem, it is important to check for errors or missing information in order to ensure that the solution is correct and complete. Checking for mistakes such as mathematical errors or calculation errors is important to ensure that the answer is accurate. Inappropriate and impolite are irrelevant choices, while books may be useful for reference but are not directly related to checking for correctness in a math problem.
The word "galactic objects" implies that the meteor is traveling in relation to something within a galaxy, rather than simply moving through empty space. An object that is orbiting is typically moving in a circular or elliptical path around a central object, which makes "orbit" the most logical choice. "Sky" is too general and doesn't specify a particular location or context, while "outerspace" and "universe" are too broad and could refer to any location beyond Earth's atmosphere. "In a vacuum" doesn't provide any information about the meteor's movement or location.
The sentence suggests that the story involves a character who undergoes a transformation from an older age to a very young age (a baby boy). The options "learn to speak," "adult," and "died" do not fit this idea. The word "old" is used twice in the sentence, indicating that age is a significant factor in the story, which rules out the option "baby boy" as the starting point. Therefore, the correct answer is "old man."
The sentence states that Bob was tossed from his boat in the Pacific Ocean near the United States and he sees a shore to the east. The only option on the list that is on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean near the United States is California. Florida is on the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean, and the other options are not specific enough or do not have a clear connection to the given context.
The sentence suggests that the discovery of truth brought some sort of release or resolution to something that had been troubling the person for a long time. "Relief" is a common feeling associated with the resolution of something that has been causing stress or anxiety. "Satisfaction" and "happiness" may also be possible, but they are not as strongly suggested by the context. "Hurt" does not make sense in this context, and "conclusion" is too general and does not capture the emotional aspect of the sentence.
Apple trees are typically grown in orchards, which are often found on farmland. Vineyards are more commonly associated with grape vines, and the south pole is a harsh environment that is not conducive to growing apple trees. While apples can potentially grow in parks, they are not typically found in abundance in those settings. An orchid is a type of flower, not a location for apple trees.
The sentence suggests that a new student is trying out a clarinet, which is something that commonly occurs in music stores. Music stores often have areas where people can try out instruments before purchasing them. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence describes a presenter talking to an audience with the aid of a projector displaying slides on a wall, which is a common feature of a conference or business meeting. The other options, such as movies, theatre, or showing films, do not fit the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
The word "changed" suggests that the person underwent some sort of transformation. The phrase "demanded it" implies that there was some external force that caused the change. The option "unpleasant" seems to be the best answer because unpleasant experiences often lead to personal growth and change. Stagnation, tradition, paper money, and wife do not necessarily suggest an external force that would demand change.
The sentence suggests that the wind is coming from the east, so the correct answer should reflect the direction of the wind. "Easterly" is an adjective commonly used to describe winds that blow from the east. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
The sentence mentions a "powered leisure vessel," which refers to a type of boat that is propelled by an engine rather than wind or oars. The helm is the steering control of such a vessel, which is commonly found on motorboats. The other options, such as sailboats or tugboats, are not typically referred to as "powered leisure vessels" and would therefore not fit the context of the sentence.
The sentence suggests that in order to begin reading, there is a necessary item that precedes the act of reading. The other options do not provide any tangible item that is required for reading. However, the option "concentration" appears twice among the choices - this is likely just a mistake, as it would not make sense for an option to be duplicated like this. Therefore, the correct answer is "written material," because without written material (such as a book or article), there can be no reading.
The question is asking what action to take when you receive something while at work. The given choices suggest different forms of communication, but only "email" is a communication method that typically requires a response. "Mute" is not an action that relates to communication and "fax" and "send" imply sending out information rather than receiving it. "Answer" is a possible option, but "email" is more specific to the context of receiving something while at work.
The sentence clearly refers to the end of the day, which is typically marked by the setting of the sun. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Deep dive" and "fall" are unrelated to the concept of time or the sun, while "lower" and "below" are vague and do not provide a clear indication of what happens at the end of the day.
Bees are commonly associated with flowers, as they play a vital role in pollination. Therefore, it makes sense that a bee would like a gift of flowers, such as a bouquet. The other options do not have any clear connection to bees or their preferences.
