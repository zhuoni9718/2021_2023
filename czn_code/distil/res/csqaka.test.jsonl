The rotating mechanism helps regulate the flow of people in and out of the building, reducing the likelihood of a rush or a stampede. Additionally, the design of the doors can help prevent unauthorized access or escape by limiting the amount of space available to pass through at any one time. The other options may also use revolving doors, but they do not have the same security implications as a bank.", "res": "The sentence suggests that the revolving door is not only convenient for two direction travel, but also serves as a security measure at a specific location. The use of the word \"security measure\" implies that the revolving door is being used for a specific purpose, which is likely to be related to security.
