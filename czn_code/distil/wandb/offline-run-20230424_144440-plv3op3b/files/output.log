--input-- Question: A revolving door is convenient for two direction travel, but it also serves as a security measure at a what? Options: A: bank,B: library,C: department store,D: mall,E: new york, Knowledge: The use of a revolving door as a security measure is commonly associated with banks. The rotating mechanism helps regulate the flow of people in and out of the building, reducing the likelihood of a rush or a stampede. Additionally, the design of the doors can help prevent unauthorized access or escape by limiting the amount of space available to pass through at any one time. The other options may also use revolving doors, but they do not have the same security implications as a bank. Answer is
--target-- bank
--input-- Question: What do people aim to do at work? Options: A: complete job,B: learn from each other,C: kill animals,D: wear hats,E: talk to each other, Knowledge: The context of the question is about work, which implies that people typically go to work to complete a job or perform some form of work-related task. Learning from each other and talking to each other may also happen at work, but they are not the primary goals. Killing animals and wearing hats are not typically associated with work unless it is a specific job requirement (such as in the case of a hunter or a hat salesperson). Answer is
--target-- complete job
--input-- Question: Where would you find magazines along side many other printed works? Options: A: doctor,B: bookstore,C: market,D: train station,E: mortuary, Knowledge: Bookstores are known to carry a variety of printed works, including magazines, books, and newspapers. They are often visited by people looking for something to read or to purchase as a gift. Doctors' offices may have magazines and other printed material available for patients, but it is unlikely that they will have many other types of printed works for sale. Markets and train stations may have newsstands, but these typically only sell newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals. Mortuaries are unlikely to have any selection of printed material at all. Answer is
--target-- bookstore
--input-- Question: Where are  you likely to find a hamburger? Options: A: fast food restaurant,B: pizza,C: ground up dead cows,D: mouth,E: cow carcus, Knowledge: A hamburger is a type of food that is typically associated with fast food restaurants, as they are often sold at these establishments. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question, as they do not relate to the common location of where hamburgers are typically found. Additionally, the options "ground up dead cows" and "cow carcass" may be considered inappropriate or offensive responses. Answer is
--target-- fast food restaurant
--input-- Question: James was looking for a good place to buy farmland.  Where might he look? Options: A: midwest,B: countryside,C: estate,D: farming areas,E: illinois, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James is searching for farmland, so the best option would be "farming areas". The other options might be helpful in a different context, but they don't necessarily relate specifically to looking for farmland. The midwest has many farming areas, but it is too broad to give a specific suggestion. The countryside and estate options could imply that James is looking for a specific type of property, but they don't necessarily indicate that those areas have farmland. Illinois may have farming areas, but it could also have other types of land that wouldn't meet James' needs. Answer is
--target-- farming areas
--input-- Question: What island country is ferret popular? Options: A: own home,B: north carolina,C: great britain,D: hutch,E: outdoors, Knowledge: The sentence is incomplete and lacks context. It is unclear what is being referred to with "ferret" and why a specific island country would be relevant. None of the given answer choices provide any information that would help in choosing a correct answer. Answer is
--target-- none of the above (there is not enough information to choose a correct answer)
--input-- Question: In what Spanish speaking North American country can you get a great cup of coffee? Options: A: mildred's coffee shop,B: mexico,C: diner,D: kitchen,E: canteen, Knowledge: The question asks for a Spanish-speaking North American country that is known for its coffee. Mexico is a Spanish-speaking country located in North America that has a long history of coffee cultivation and production. The other options are not countries and do not have any clear connection to coffee or Spanish-speaking cultures in North America. Answer is
--target-- Mexico
--input-- Question: What do animals do when an enemy is approaching? Options: A: feel pleasure,B: procreate,C: pass water,D: listen to each other,E: sing, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the sentence is referring to how animals behave in response to a threat or danger. Listening to each other is a common tactic among animals, allowing them to communicate and coordinate their responses in the face of danger. The other options do not make sense in this context - feeling pleasure, procreating, and passing water are unrelated to responding to an enemy, while singing is only used by a few species of animals and is not typically associated with a response to danger. Answer is
--target-- listen to each other
--input-- Question: Reading newspaper one of many ways to practice your what? Options: A: literacy,B: knowing how to read,C: money,D: buying,E: money bank, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that reading a newspaper is a way to practice something. Literacy is the ability to read and write proficiently, so it makes sense that reading a newspaper would help improve one's literacy skills. The other options do not relate to the context of reading a newspaper as a practice. Answer is
--target-- literacy
--input-- Question: What do people typically do while playing guitar? Options: A: cry,B: hear sounds,C: singing,D: arthritis,E: making music, Knowledge: Playing guitar typically involves the production of music through the plucking or strumming of strings on a guitar. While singing may also be part of playing guitar, it is not always the case. Similarly, while hearing sounds is a necessary part of playing guitar, it is not a unique characteristic of guitar playing. Arthritis is a medical condition that may affect someone's ability to play guitar, but it is not something that people typically do while playing guitar. Crying is also not typically associated with playing guitar, although it is possible that someone may cry while playing if the music evokes strong emotions. Answer is
--target-- making music
--input-- Question: What would vinyl be an odd thing to replace? Options: A: pants,B: record albums,C: record store,D: cheese,E: wallpaper, Knowledge: Vinyl is a type of material commonly used for record albums and wallpaper, so it would not be odd to replace those things with vinyl. Pants and cheese have no obvious connection to vinyl, and a record store is not something that can be physically replaced with a material. Answer is
--target-- cheese
--input-- Question: If you want harmony, what is something you should try to do with the world? Options: A: take time,B: make noise,C: make war,D: make peace,E: make haste, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that harmony is desired with the world, which is most likely achieved through peaceful actions. Making noise and making war are likely to create disharmony, while taking time and making haste do not have a clear connection to achieving harmony with the world. Therefore, making peace is the most logical answer. Answer is
--target-- make peace
--input-- Question: Where does a heifer's master live? Options: A: farm house,B: barnyard,C: stockyard,D: slaughter house,E: eat cake, Knowledge: A heifer is a young female cow that has not yet given birth, and is typically raised on a farm. Therefore, it is likely that the heifer's master, or owner, would also live on a farm. The other options do not fit the context of a heifer being raised on a farm, such as a stockyard or slaughterhouse. "Eat cake" is not a relevant option at all. Answer is
--target-- farm house
--input-- Question: Aside from water and nourishment what does your dog need? Options: A: bone,B: charm,C: petted,D: lots of attention,E: walked, Knowledge: The question implies that the answer is something other than water and nourishment that a dog needs. Of the given choices, only "lots of attention" fits this criteria as dogs require social interaction and companionship. The other choices, such as bone or charm, may be nice for a dog to have but do not fulfill an essential need like attention does. "Petted" may also be a nice-to-have, but it is not a requirement for a dog's well-being. "Walked" is important for a dog's physical health, but is not the only thing a dog needs besides water and nourishment. Answer is
--target-- lots of attention
--input-- Question: Janet was watching the film because she liked what? Options: A: erection,B: laughter,C: being entertained,D: fear,E: bordem, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Janet is watching a film because she enjoys it, which is most commonly associated with being entertained. The other options, such as erection and fear, seem inappropriate and do not align with the context of the sentence. Laughter could be a reason for watching a film, but it is not the only one and the sentence does not explicitly suggest it. Bordem is also not specifically mentioned in the sentence and seems like an unlikely reason for someone to watch a movie. Answer is
--target-- being entertained
--input-- Question: What are you waiting alongside with when you're in a reception area? Options: A: motel,B: chair,C: hospital,D: people,E: hotels, Knowledge: The word "waiting" implies that someone is waiting for something, and the phrase "alongside with" suggests that they are waiting with someone or something else. In a reception area, this would typically mean waiting with other people who are also waiting to be seen or served. The other options, such as motels, chairs, hospitals, and hotels, do not fit the context of waiting alongside something. Answer is
--target-- people
--input-- Question: When drinking booze what can you do to stay busy? Options: A: reach tentative agreement,B: stay in bed,C: stop bicycle,D: examine thing,E: suicide, Knowledge: The sentence implies that when consuming alcohol, one may need something to occupy their attention. "Examine thing" is the only logical option as it suggests looking at or exploring something, which could provide a distraction. The other options are either nonsensical, dangerous, or unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- examine thing
--input-- Question: A fencing thrust with a sharp sword towards a person would result in what? Options: A: injury,B: small cuts,C: fever,D: competition,E: puncture wound, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a fencing thrust with a sharp sword, which implies an intentional and forceful action. Injuries and small cuts are too general and do not specifically relate to the action described. Fever and competition are unrelated to the context of the sentence. A puncture wound is a more specific and accurate outcome of a fencing thrust with a sharp sword. Answer is
--target-- puncture wound
--input-- Question: Unlike a spider and his many sight seers, people only have what? Options: A: tongues,B: names,C: brains,D: feelings,E: two eyes, Knowledge: The sentence is comparing people to spiders and their sightseeing abilities. The phrase "unlike a spider and his many sightseers" suggests that spiders have many eyes to sightsee with, while people do not. This narrows down the possible answers to either "brains" or "two eyes." However, the second part of the sentence clarifies that people do have a visual sense, which means the correct answer is "two eyes." The other options are irrelevant or incorrect based on the given context. Answer is
--target-- two eyes
--input-- Question: Where do adults use glue sticks? Options: A: classroom,B: desk drawer,C: at school,D: office,E: kitchen drawer, Knowledge: The question is asking about the location where adults use glue sticks, which suggests a professional or work-related context. The options "classroom", "at school", and "desk drawer" may suggest a more academic setting, but the use of the word "adults" rules out these choices. "Kitchen drawer" may suggest a household setting, but again, the context of the question implies a workplace environment. Therefore, "office" is the most logical and likely answer. Answer is
--target-- office
--input-- Question: What could go on top of wood? Options: A: lumberyard,B: synagogue,C: floor,D: carpet,E: hardware store, Knowledge: The question is asking about what can be placed on top of wood, implying that the wood is being used as a base or foundation. The most logical answer is therefore "floor," as flooring is commonly installed on top of wood subfloors. The other options do not relate to this context - a lumberyard sells wood products rather than things that go on top of wood, a synagogue is a place of worship and not related to wood, carpet is typically placed over a subfloor rather than on top of wood, and a hardware store may sell items that can be used in conjunction with wood but not necessarily on top of it. Answer is
--target-- floor
--input-- Question: The artist was sitting quietly pondering, then suddenly he began to paint when what struck him? Options: A: sadness,B: anxiety,C: inspiration,D: discomfort,E: insights, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the artist was in a contemplative mood before he suddenly started painting. The word "pondering" implies that he was thinking deeply about something. The fact that he started painting implies that he was struck by an idea or inspiration. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. For example, sadness, anxiety, and discomfort would be more likely to inhibit creativity than inspire it. Insights are a little more ambiguous, but the sentence doesn't suggest that the artist was actively seeking understanding or knowledge at the time. Answer is
--target-- inspiration
--input-- Question: Though the thin film seemed fragile, for it's intended purpose it was actually nearly what? Options: A: indestructible,B: durable,C: undestroyable,D: indestructible,E: unbreakable, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the thin film may seem fragile at first glance, but it is actually incredibly strong for its intended purpose. The word "nearly" suggests that the film is not completely indestructible, but very close to it. The other options, such as "durable" and "unbreakable," suggest strength but not necessarily to the same extreme degree as "indestructible." Answer is
--target-- indestructible
--input-- Question: Where could you find a toilet that only friends can use? Options: A: rest area,B: school,C: stadium,D: apartment,E: hospital, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a unique type of toilet that is only accessible to friends, which is unlikely to be found in public places such as rest areas, schools, stadiums, or hospitals. Apartments, on the other hand, often have private facilities that are only available to residents or their guests, which could explain why this type of toilet might be found in an apartment. Answer is
--target-- apartment
--input-- Question: What is someone who isn't clever, bright, or competent called? Options: A: clumsy,B: ineffectual,C: dull,D: clumsy,E: stupid, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to lacks intelligence and competence, as they are described as not being clever or bright. The word 'stupid' directly conveys this meaning. The other options may have some overlapping connotations, but they do not accurately capture the full meaning conveyed in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- stupid
--input-- Question: When wildlife reproduce we often refer to what comes out as what? Options: A: raise children,B: have children,C: photo copy,D: offspring,E: accidently got pregnant somehow, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the focus is on reproduction in wildlife. The correct term for the young that are born as a result of reproduction is offspring. The other options are not accurate or appropriate in the context of reproduction in wildlife. Answer is
--target-- offspring
--input-- Question: The weasel was becoming a problem, it kept getting into the chicken eggs kept in the what? Options: A: forrest,B: barn,C: public office,D: out of doors,E: freezer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel was causing problems by getting into the chicken eggs, which implies that the eggs were being stored in a place accessible to the weasel. A barn is a common place to keep chickens and their eggs, which makes it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- barn
--input-- Question: Blue read material outside of his comfort zone because he wanted to gain what? Options: A: new perspective,B: entertained,C: understanding,D: hunger,E: tired eyes, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Blue intentionally read material that was outside of his comfort zone, which implies that he was attempting to broaden his knowledge or gain a new perspective. This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices (entertained, understanding, hunger, tired eyes) do not relate to the goal of expanding one's perspective through reading. Answer is
--target-- new perspective
--input-- Question: After he got hired he hoped for success at his what? Options: A: vocation,B: new job,C: michigan,D: working hard,E: manual, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question has just gotten hired and is hoping for success in their new position. The word "vocation" specifically refers to a person's career or profession, making it the most appropriate answer. "New job" is too broad and general, while "Michigan" and "manual" do not make sense in this context. "Working hard" is a characteristic that may lead to success but does not directly answer the question. Answer is
--target-- vocation
--input-- Question: Committing perjury is a serious what? Options: A: indictment,B: crime,C: violence,D: lie,E: go to jail, Knowledge: Perjury is the act of lying under oath, which is considered to be a criminal offense in many jurisdictions. Committing perjury can result in legal consequences such as indictment or imprisonment, but the most appropriate choice to complete the sentence would be "crime," since it accurately reflects the severity of the offense. "Violence" would not be an appropriate choice as perjury is not a violent act, and "lie" and "go to jail" are too specific or simplistic to capture the seriousness of the offense. Answer is
--target-- crime
--input-- Question: If you are prone to postpone work what will you have to do in order to finish on time? Options: A: eat,B: hasten,C: antedate,D: bring forward,E: advance, Knowledge: The word "postpone" means to delay or put off, so if someone is prone to doing this with their work, they will likely need to take action to speed up their progress in order to finish on time. The word "hasten" means to hurry or accelerate, making it the most appropriate choice for this context. The other options ("eat," "antedate," "bring forward," and "advance") do not have any clear correlation with the idea of completing work on time. Answer is
--target-- hasten
--input-- Question: James wanted to find an old underground map from the 50s.  Where might he look for one? Options: A: library,B: subway station,C: county engineer's office,D: super market,E: home, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is looking for an old underground map from the 50s, which is likely to be related to the subway system. Therefore, the most logical option would be the subway station where the map would have been used. The library, county engineer's office, and super market are unlikely to have such specific maps, and there is no context to suggest that James might find the map at home. Answer is
--target-- subway station
--input-- Question: Sean was in a rush to get home, but the light turned yellow and he was forced to do what? Options: A: take time,B: dawdle,C: go slowly,D: ocean,E: slow down, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean was in a hurry to get home, but he encountered a yellow traffic light which forced him to do something other than hurry. The most logical option is to slow down, as this is a common response to a yellow traffic light. The other options, such as taking time or dawdling, do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. The inclusion of "ocean" as a choice is also irrelevant and does not make sense in the given sentence. Answer is
--target-- slow down
--input-- Question: Where would a person be doing when having to wait their turn? Options: A: have patience,B: get in line,C: sing,D: stand in line,E: turn left, Knowledge: The phrase "waiting their turn" suggests that there is a queue or line that the person needs to join in order to wait their turn. "Standing in line" is a commonly used phrase to describe this action. "Getting in line" is also a possible answer, but "stand in line" is more specific and relevant in this context. "Having patience" is a general attitude that could apply to many situations, and "turn left" and "sing" are not related to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- stand in line
--input-- Question: She was always helping at the senior center, it brought her what? Options: A: satisfaction,B: heart,C: feel better,D: pay,E: happiness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys volunteering at the senior center and gets some sort of positive feeling from it. "Satisfaction" is the best match for this sentiment, as it implies a sense of personal fulfillment and achievement from helping others. "Heart" and "feel better" are too vague and could refer to any number of emotions or sensations. "Pay" does not make sense in the context of volunteering, and "happines" does not fit as well as "satisfaction" due to the specific phrasing of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: The lock kept the steering wheel from moving, but the thief still took his chances and began to work on the what? Options: A: keep cloesd,B: train,C: ignition switch,D: drawer,E: firearm, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the thief was still attempting to steal the vehicle despite the lock preventing the steering wheel from moving, which implies that they were trying to access the key mechanism. The ignition switch is the part of the car that starts the engine and would therefore be the logical target for the thief. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or provide any indication of what the thief may have been trying to access. Answer is
--target-- ignition switch
--input-- Question: Who is a police officer likely to work for? Options: A: beat,B: direct traffic,C: city,D: street,E: president, Knowledge: Police officers usually work for a governmental jurisdiction such as a city, county, or state. The other options do not represent a typical employer for a police officer. "Beat" and "street" describe a patrol area or location, while "direct traffic" is a specific task within the job of a police officer. "President" is not an appropriate employer for a police officer. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: If you have leftover cake, where would you put it? Options: A: quandry,B: refrigerator,C: oven,D: night stand,E: bakery, Knowledge: The question involves storing leftover cake, which suggests that the cake should be preserved for later consumption. The most common way to preserve food items is by storing them in a refrigerator, which helps to slow down microbial growth and prevent food spoilage. The other options are not appropriate for storing perishable food items like cake. Quandry refers to a state of uncertainty, oven is used for baking and night stand is a piece of furniture, while bakery is a place where cakes are made and sold, not stored. Answer is
--target-- refrigerator
--input-- Question: A human wants to submerge himself in water, what should he use? Options: A: whirlpool bath,B: coffee cup,C: cup,D: soft drink,E: puddle, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to completely immerse themselves in water, which is not possible with a coffee cup, cup, soft drink, or puddle. A whirlpool bath is a type of bathtub that has water jets that circulate the water, creating a swirling motion similar to a whirlpool. This makes it an ideal choice for someone who wants to submerge themselves in water. The other options do not offer a viable option for submerging oneself in water. Answer is
--target-- whirlpool bath
--input-- Question: Where is a doormat likely to be in front of? Options: A: facade,B: front door,C: doorway,D: entrance porch,E: hallway, Knowledge: A doormat is typically placed in front of the front door of a building or house. The purpose of a doormat is to trap dirt and debris from shoes before entering the building, and this is most effective when placed directly in front of the entry point. While a doormat could technically be placed in some of the other options listed, such as an entrance porch or hallway, it is most commonly associated with the front door. Answer is
--target-- front door
--input-- Question: Bob the lizard lives in a warm place with lots of water.  Where does he probably live? Options: A: rock,B: tropical rainforest,C: jazz club,D: new mexico,E: rocky places, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Bob the lizard lives in a warm place with lots of water. The answer choice that best fits this description is a tropical rainforest, which is known for high temperatures, high humidity, and abundant rainfall. The other options, such as rock and rocky places, do not necessarily suggest a warm place or lots of water. New Mexico, while warm, is known for arid desert landscapes rather than plentiful water. Jazz club is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- tropical rainforest
--input-- Question: August needed  money because he was afraid that he'd be kicked out of his house.  What did he need money to do? Options: A: control people,B: pay bills,C: hurt people,D: buy food,E: get things, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that August was in danger of losing his house, which could happen if he was unable to pay his bills. Therefore, the correct answer is "pay bills." The other options do not relate to August's financial struggle or the consequences of not having enough money to pay for basic needs like housing. Answer is
--target-- pay bills
--input-- Question: He needed more information to fix it, so he consulted the what? Options: A: chickens,B: google,C: newspaper,D: online,E: manual, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed more information to fix something, which implies that the object is a machine or device. Consulting a manual is a common way to obtain specific instructions for repairing or operating a device. The other options, such as chickens, google, newspaper, and online, do not have any clear connection to obtaining specific information for repairing a machine. Answer is
--target-- manual
--input-- Question: Where can you put a picture frame when it's not hung vertically? Options: A: art show,B: wall,C: newspaper,D: car,E: table, Knowledge: The question suggests that the picture frame is not hung vertically, meaning it is placed horizontally instead. The option "table" makes the most sense as it is a flat surface where a picture frame can be placed horizontally. The other options do not provide a clear surface for placing a picture frame horizontally, such as an art show, wall, newspaper, and car. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: James knew that he shouldn't have been buying beer for minors.  He didn't even get paid for it.  Why was this bad? Options: A: lose money,B: fun,C: have no money,D: broken law,E: relaxation, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James was engaging in an illegal activity, which was buying beer for minors. Buying alcohol for individuals under the legal drinking age is a crime, and individuals who are caught engaging in such activities can be subject to fines, jail time, or other legal consequences. The other options do not provide any information that directly relates to the illegal nature of James' actions. Answer is
--target-- broken law
--input-- Question: What is the result of applying for  job? Options: A: anxiety and fear,B: increased workload,C: praise,D: less sleep,E: being employed, Knowledge: Applying for a job typically has the goal of securing employment. The other options are not common or desirable results of applying for a job. Anxiety and fear may be associated with the job interview process, but the ultimate goal is still to obtain employment. Increased workload may come after being employed, but it is not a direct result of applying. Praise and less sleep are also unlikely results of simply applying for a job. Answer is
--target-- being employed
--input-- Question: What must someone do before they shop? Options: A: get money,B: have money,C: bring cash,D: go to market,E: bring cash, Knowledge: The question implies that there is a prerequisite action that one must engage in before they can go shopping. Since the other options involve already having money or bringing cash with you, it can be inferred that the correct answer involves obtaining the money needed to make purchases. This is a common step that most people take before going shopping, as it is difficult to make purchases without any funds. Answer is
--target-- get money
--input-- Question: Because John was first violin, he had to bring something important to work ever day. What did he need to bring to work? Options: A: music store,B: obesity,C: symphony orchestra,D: ochestra,E: violin case, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John's role as first violin in a symphony orchestra requires him to bring something specific to work every day. Given that he is a violinist, it makes sense that he would need to bring his instrument with him in a protective case. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- violin case
--input-- Question: What is a place that usually does not have an elevator and that sometimes has a telephone book? Options: A: at hotel,B: kitchen,C: library,D: telephone booth,E: house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being described is relatively small and may not have modern amenities like elevators. Additionally, the use of a telephone book further supports the idea that the place may be a telephone booth, which is a small enclosure designed for making phone calls. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- telephone booth
--input-- Question: Who is likely to be excited about a crab? Options: A: fish market,B: pet shop,C: fishmongers,D: intertidal zone,E: obesity, Knowledge: The word "excited" implies that someone may want to own the crab as a pet. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is a pet shop. The other options do not make sense in this context. A fish market or fishmonger may sell crabs for consumption, but they would not be excited about the crab as a pet. The intertidal zone is a location where crabs may be found, but it is not a person or group of people who would be excited about a crab. Obesity is not related to the question. Answer is
--target-- pet shop
--input-- Question: Where can a human find clothes that aren't pants? Options: A: pants shop,B: on planet earth,C: dress shop,D: school,E: train wreck, Knowledge: The question is asking specifically for clothes that aren't pants, so the answer must be a shop that sells garments other than pants. Of the given choices, only a dress shop would likely carry clothing options that do not include pants. The other options are either unrelated or do not offer any indication that they would carry non-pant clothing options. Answer is
--target-- dress shop
--input-- Question: If I was getting drunk, and people couldn't understand me, what might I be having? Options: A: a seizure,B: slurred speech,C: death,D: forgetfulness,E: pass out, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is having difficulty communicating clearly while intoxicated. This is commonly associated with slurred speech, where the words become unclear and difficult to understand. A seizure and death are unlikely outcomes of getting drunk, and forgetfulness and passing out do not specifically relate to communication difficulties. Answer is
--target-- slurred speech
--input-- Question: When a person is beginning work, what are they building? Options: A: time,B: accomplishing,C: working,D: momentum,E: tiredness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is just starting work, which implies that they are trying to get themselves into a productive state of mind. Building momentum refers to the process of gathering energy and motivation to get started on a task, which is likely to be the person's goal. Time and tiredness are not things that a person can "build," and "working" and "accomplishing" do not convey the same sense of starting out or gathering energy. Answer is
--target-- momentum
--input-- Question: A child wants to play, what would they likely want? Options: A: fall down,B: breathe,C: play tag,D: be dismembered by a chainsaw,E: become adult, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the child wants to engage in an activity that is typically associated with play.

The other options are either dangerous or do not have any clear connection to the idea of playing. Answer is
--target-- play tag
--input-- Question: Talking to the same person about the same thing over and over again is something someone can what? Options: A: social life,B: friendship,C: eye contact,D: get tired of,E: learn lessons from, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of repeatedly talking to the same person about the same thing can become tiresome. This is a common experience for many people, and can often lead to feelings of frustration, boredom, or even annoyance. The other options do not necessarily relate to the idea of getting tired of something or someone. Answer is

--input-- Question: The teacher doesn't tolerate noise during a test in their what? Options: A: movie theatre,B: bowling alley,C: factory,D: store,E: classroom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is a test, which is typically taken in a classroom. The other options (movie theatre, bowling alley, factory, store) are unlikely to be places where a test would be administered, and therefore can be eliminated as choices. Additionally, the use of the word "teacher" further supports the conclusion that the correct answer is "classroom." Answer is
--target-- classroom
--input-- Question: The freeway had no traffic and few buildings, where is it? Options: A: california,B: countryside,C: big town,D: florida,E: america, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the freeway is located in a rural or sparsely populated area, as there is no traffic and few buildings. This eliminates options such as California, big town, and Florida, which are all known for their busy highways and urban development. "Countryside" is the most fitting option, as it implies a location outside of a major city or suburban area. "America" is too broad to be the correct answer, as it does not provide any specific details about the location of the freeway. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: Where would you go if you wanted to have fun with a few people? Options: A: watching television,B: good,C: cinema,D: friend's house,E: fairgrounds, Knowledge: The question suggests that the activity involves a small group of people and is likely to be social in nature. Watching television and going to the cinema are activities that can be done alone or with a large group, while going to a fairground may be too crowded or overwhelming for a small group. "Good" is not a viable answer option as it is not a location or activity. Going to a friend's house is a common choice for a small group outing as it provides a comfortable and intimate setting for socializing and having fun with friends. Answer is
--target-- friend's house
--input-- Question: If there is a place that is hot and arid, what could it be? Options: A: bland,B: lifeless,C: sandy,D: neutral,E: freezing, Knowledge: The sentence describes a place that is hot and arid, which suggests that it is likely to be in a desert or similar region where the terrain is sandy and dry. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bland," "lifeless," and "neutral" describe qualities that are not related to climate or geography, while "freezing" suggests a cold climate, which contradicts the description of the place as "hot and arid." Answer is
--target-- sandy
--input-- Question: What is likely to satisfy someone's curiosity? Options: A: hear news,B: read book,C: see favorite show,D: comedy show,E: go somewhere, Knowledge: There is no definitive answer to this question, as what satisfies one person's curiosity may not satisfy another's. For example, someone who is interested in current events may find hearing news to be the most satisfying, while someone who enjoys comedy may find a comedy show to be more fulfilling. Therefore, it is important to consider the context and personal interests of the individual when choosing an answer to this question. Answer is
--target-- It depends on the person's individual interests and preferences.

--input-- Question: Where would a computer user be using their own computer? Options: A: hell,B: school,C: indoors,D: internet cafe,E: house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the computer user is using their own computer, which would typically mean that they are in a location where they have access to their personal computer. The options "hell" and "school" are unlikely locations for using a personal computer, while "internet cafe" suggests that the user is accessing a shared computer. "Indoors" could be a possibility, but it is too broad to make a definitive choice. Therefore, "house" is the best option as it specifically refers to a location where someone would have their own personal computer. Answer is
--target-- house
--input-- Question: Crabs live in what sort of environment? Options: A: maritime,B: bodies of water,C: saltwater,D: galapagos,E: fish market, Knowledge: Crabs are aquatic animals and are typically found in bodies of saltwater such as oceans, seas, and estuaries.

Answer is
--target-- saltwater
--input-- Question: Where can you find a snake in tall grass? Options: A: tree,B: in a jar,C: pet shops,D: feild,E: tropical forest, Knowledge: Tall grass is a common habitat for snakes. The other options, such as tree or in a jar, do not make sense in the context of the question. Snakes can also be found in tropical forests, but the question specifically mentions tall grass, which is a common feature of fields. Pet shops are also an irrelevant option as they usually do not keep snakes in tall grass. Answer is
--target-- field
--input-- Question: What is a place that has a bench nestled in trees? Options: A: state park,B: bus stop,C: bus depot,D: statue,E: train station, Knowledge: The use of the word "nestled" suggests that the bench is in a natural setting rather than a city or urban environment. A state park is a protected area of land that is often known for its natural beauty and includes features like trees, trails, and benches for visitors to rest and enjoy the environment. The other options do not have a clear association with benches in a natural setting. Answer is
--target-- state park
--input-- Question: Where is a human likely to go as a result of being hungry? Options: A: eat in restaurant,B: make bread,C: have lunch,D: cook dinner,E: friends house, Knowledge: The question is asking about the likely action a person would take when they are hungry. Option A, eating in a restaurant, is commonly associated with satisfying hunger, as restaurants specialize in providing food to customers. The other options, while related to food, do not necessarily guarantee that hunger will be satisfied, and may require time or resources that a hungry person may not have available. Answer is
--target-- eat in restaurant
--input-- Question: He was beginning to regret taking the fight when he saw how what his opponent was? Options: A: fun,B: joy,C: satisfaction,D: confident,E: pride, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject is experiencing doubts or hesitation about their decision to fight, likely due to a perceived disadvantage or unfavorable matchup. The description of the opponent as "confident" implies that they are skilled or experienced in some way, giving the subject reason to believe that the fight will be harder than they initially anticipated. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence or offer any insight into the subject's thoughts or feelings. Answer is
--target-- confident
--input-- Question: Where would you find a single shower curtain being used? Options: A: bathtub,B: washing area,C: hotel,D: shower stall,E: department store, Knowledge: A shower stall is a contained area specifically designed for taking showers, and a shower curtain is commonly used to prevent water from splashing outside of the stall. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a bathtub may require multiple curtains or none at all, a washing area may not require a curtain, a hotel may have different styles of bathrooms, and a department store does not use shower curtains for their intended purpose. Answer is
--target-- shower stall
--input-- Question: Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher? Options: A: school bus,B: boat,C: house,D: hospital,E: school, Knowledge: The question is asking where it is a good idea to have a fire extinguisher, but not required. A house is a common place where fires can occur, especially in the kitchen, so having a fire extinguisher nearby can be helpful in case of emergency. The other options may also be places where fires can occur, but they may have special regulations or requirements for fire safety equipment. A school bus or boat, for example, may have their own fire suppression systems already in place, and hospitals and schools may have specific fire safety protocols that go beyond just having a fire extinguisher. Answer is
--target-- house
--input-- Question: What continent has the most castles? Options: A: fairy tale,B: edinburgh,C: germany,D: europe,E: antarctica, Knowledge: Castles are typically associated with medieval European history, which suggests that the answer is likely to be a European country/continent. Additionally, Edinburgh is a city in Scotland known for its historic castle, while fairy tale is a genre and not a geographic location. Antarctica is mostly uninhabitable and unlikely to have castles. This leaves Germany and Europe as the remaining choices, but Germany is just one country within Europe and may not have the most castles overall. Therefore, the correct answer is Europe. Answer is
--target-- Europe
--input-- Question: If you have to read a book that is very dry and long you may become what? Options: A: have time,B: boring,C: learn new,D: enjoyable,E: bored, Knowledge: The question states that the book in question is "very dry and long," which suggests that it may be difficult to engage with or find interesting. The word "bored" is also a common descriptor for this type of situation, as it implies a lack of engagement or enjoyment. The other answer choices are either irrelevant to the context of the question (e.g. "have time" or "learn new") or are the opposite of the expected outcome (e.g. "enjoyable"). Answer is
--target-- bored

Options: A: desk,B: windows 95,C: office supply store,D: see work,E: school, Knowledge: The mention of reading off names at the beginning of the day suggests that Sally could be a teacher or administrator in a school setting. Using a clipboard to hold papers is also a common practice in schools to keep important documents organized and easily accessible. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- school
--input-- Question: The kids didn't clean up after they had done what? Options: A: learn things,B: play games,C: disneyland,D: play with toys,E: talking, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the kids left a mess behind, which is typically associated with playing with toys. Learning things or talking do not necessarily create a mess, while going to Disneyland is not directly relevant to the sentence. Playing games could potentially create a mess, but it is less likely to be assumed than playing with toys. Answer is
--target-- play with toys

--target-- chess game

Options: A: punctured,B: popular in america,C: full of air,D: gone,E: round, Knowledge: The question is asking about a basketball with a hole but still retains its shape. This eliminates the option "gone," which suggests that the basketball no longer exists or has lost its shape entirely. The other options all have to do with characteristics of a basketball: it can be "punctured" by something sharp, it is "full of air" to maintain its round shape, and it is "popular in America" as it is a common sport in the country. The option "round" is also a characteristic of a basketball as it is a spherical object. Answer is
--target-- gone
--input-- Question: If you are awaking multiple times throughout the night because a lot is on your mind, what is a likely cause? Options: A: irritability,B: depression,C: getting out of bed,D: happiness,E: discomfort, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the problem is waking up frequently throughout the night, which may be due to the need to get out of bed and attend to things that are on the person's mind. Irritability and discomfort may contribute to the problem but they are not the likely cause given the context of the sentence. Depression and happiness are not related to the sentence. Answer is
--target-- getting out of bed
--input-- Question: Where does a wild bird usually live? Options: A: cage,B: sky,C: countryside,D: desert,E: windowsill, Knowledge: A wild bird is not typically found living in a cage, windowsill, or desert.

Options: A: free will,B: choice,C: will,D: alcohol,E: freedom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests a contrast between John's belief in fate and Harry's belief in an alternative option. The word "different" also suggests that Harry believed John could have chosen an alternative course of action, indicating the importance of choices. Therefore, "choice" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "free will," "will," "alcohol," and "freedom" do not directly relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- choice
--input-- Question: What could committing murder prevent someone from doing? Options: A: go to jail,B: cry,C: find god,D: guilty conscience,E: problems, Knowledge: Committing murder is a serious offense that can weigh heavily on a person's conscience. The act of taking another person's life can have long-lasting psychological effects, including feelings of guilt and remorse.

The other options are not necessarily directly related to murder and do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- guilty conscience

--target-- construction site
--input-- Question: What is the main purpose of farmers? Options: A: raise cattle,B: grow corn,C: farm land,D: drive tractors,E: supply food, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that farmers have a main purpose, which is something they prioritize above other activities. The options given all relate to farming in some way, but only "supply food" directly speaks to the purpose of farming. While raising cattle, growing corn, and farming land are all aspects of the farming process, their main goal is to produce food for consumption. Driving tractors is a part of the process but not the main purpose of being a farmer. Answer is
--target-- supply food
--input-- Question: Where can I put this penny to save for later? Options: A: piggy bank,B: wallet,C: toy,D: ground,E: pocket, Knowledge: A piggy bank is a container specifically designed to hold coins and small amounts of money for saving.

Options: A: wharf,B: red lobster,C: tidepools,D: boss's office,E: stew pot, Knowledge: The question is about where to put uncooked crab meat, suggesting that it needs to be cooked in order to be consumed. The only option that relates to cooking is the stew pot.

The boss's office and Red Lobster are also irrelevant to the question. Answer is
--target-- stew pot

Options: A: sick person,B: hospital,C: elderly person,D: graveyard,E: doctor's office, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had a fear of illness and avoided visiting certain people as a result. The most likely choice for someone to avoid if they were afraid of illness would be a sick person, as they would be more likely to spread germs or be contagious. The other options do not necessarily imply the presence of illness or disease, and would not necessarily be avoided by someone with a fear of illness. Answer is
--target-- sick person
--input-- Question: Where would you put pans if you want to bring them with you? Options: A: cooking,B: cook food,C: kitchen,D: backpack,E: drawer, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the pans are being transported from one place to another, as the question asks where to put them if you want to bring them with you. The options "cooking" and "cook food" do not make sense in this context, as they refer to the act of using pans rather than storing or transporting them. "Kitchen" and "drawer" may be places to store pans, but they do not fit the requirement of bringing them with you. "Backpack" is the only option that fits the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- backpack
--input-- Question: If you're remembering something, it's because of your what of it to begin with? Options: A: knowledge,B: knowing,C: forgetful,D: pleasure,E: depression, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering something is a result of having knowledge of it to begin with. This makes sense as memory is often linked to one's ability to retain and recall information that they have learned or experienced.

--target-- knowledge

The other options do not provide any information about monkey habitats or populations. Answer is
--target-- African continent
--input-- Question: Friday was James's 5th Anniversary.  They planned on going to bed early so that they could spend a long time doing what? Options: A: rest,B: insomnia,C: making love,D: sleeping in,E: texting, Knowledge: The fact that Friday was James's 5th anniversary and that they planned on going to bed early suggests that they may have scheduled some romantic activity for the occasion. "Making love" is a common phrase used to refer to sexual activity between romantic partners, so this option is the most likely answer. "Rest" and "sleeping in" suggest a normal night's sleep, which would not be a special way to celebrate an anniversary. "Insomnia" refers to difficulty sleeping, which is the opposite of what James and their partner planned. "Texting" is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- making love
--input-- Question: The teens were trying to hide that they get drink, but when they walked in the door their what gave it away? Options: A: health,B: fall down,C: stagger,D: get arrested,E: vomit, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teens were trying to conceal their consumption of alcohol, but their actions upon entering the door revealed the truth. The option "stagger" fits this context as it suggests unsteadiness or swaying, which can be a sign of intoxication. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context and may not apply to the situation described. For example, "get arrested" suggests a more extreme outcome that may not have occurred in this case. Answer is
--target-- stagger
--input-- Question: You'll find a landing at the top of what? Options: A: ocean,B: apartment building,C: stairwell,D: airport,E: room, Knowledge: The word "landing" suggests a space for individuals to step off or onto a set of stairs.

An ocean, airport, apartment building or room would not have a landing at the top. Answer is
--target-- stairwell

Options: A: forget,B: oil squeaky hinge,C: question authority,D: wash dishes,E: oik squeaky hinge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that anyone could be hired in the kitchen, implying that the job did not require any particular skills or qualifications. The specific task mentioned in the choices, washing dishes, is commonly associated with entry-level kitchen jobs that do not require extensive experience or training. The other choices, such as forgetting or questioning authority, do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence. The repeated choice, "oik squeaky hinge," is likely a typo and can be disregarded. Answer is
--target-- wash dishes
--input-- Question: Where can you find a number of wind instruments together in public? Options: A: music store,B: create music,C: zoo,D: music room,E: symphony, Knowledge: The term "wind instruments" refers to a family of musical instruments that require air to create sound (e.g. flute, saxophone, trumpet, etc.).

--target-- symphony

Options: A: urban area,B: metropolis,C: chicago,D: new york city,E: toronto, Knowledge: The term "mountie" is slang for a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is primarily based in Canada. The reference to a subway stop suggests that the city in question has a subway system. While Chicago and New York City have subway systems, they do not have a large number of Mounties, as this law enforcement agency operates only in Canada. Toronto is a major city in Canada with a subway system and is therefore the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- Toronto
--input-- Question: What do you want someone to do when you illustrate point? Options: A: did not understand,B: accepting,C: make clear,D: understood,E: understanding, Knowledge: The word "illustrate" implies that the communication is visual or graphical in nature, and the purpose of illustrating a point is often to make it clearer to the audience. "Make clear" is the best answer as it directly relates to this purpose. "Did not understand" and "accepted" are not relevant to the question, and both "understood" and "understanding" are already assumptions that someone has comprehended the point being made, rather than actions that could be taken. Answer is
--target-- make clear
--input-- Question: Billy set aside a block of time for having fun after work. Why might he do this? Options: A: happiness,B: stress relief,C: pleasure,D: ocean,E: may laugh, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy is intentionally setting aside time for something enjoyable after work.

This suggests that the man in the blue was productive, meaning he accomplished something useful or valuable.

Lazybutt is not a commonly used term, and does not fit the tone of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- productive
--input-- Question: What would you be unable to do if you have too much greed? Options: A: keep things,B: make friends,C: play poker,D: conquer opponent,E: lie, Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of having too much greed. Greed is a desire for excessive wealth or possessions, and someone who is consumed by it may prioritize their own interests over the needs or feelings of others. This can make it difficult to form and maintain friendships, as a strong focus on personal gain can alienate others and make them feel undervalued. The other options may be affected by greed to some extent, but they are not inherently or directly linked to the negative effects of excessive greed. Answer is
--target-- make friends

Having an open mind means being willing to consider new ideas and perspectives without judgment or bias. This is important for eliminating preconceived notions, which are pre-existing opinions or beliefs that can limit our understanding of new information. The other options, such as newness or smartness, do not necessarily relate to this idea of open-mindedness and are less relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- open mind

Therefore, the correct answer would be something that relates to the functional capabilities of computers. Out of the given options, only "multitask" refers to a specific functional capability of computers, which is the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The other options are either not directly related to the sentence or are too basic to be considered a big deal. Answer is

The other options, such as "universe" and "outer space," are too broad and do not accurately reflect what is being described in the sentence. Additionally, the mention of the "size" of something further supports the idea that James is observing the night sky, as it is common to marvel at the vastness and seeming infinitude of the stars and galaxies visible in the night sky. Answer is

Exercise provides physical and mental benefits, such as improved stamina and release of endorphins, which can positively impact one's mood and motivation to continue playing. The other options are unlikely to encourage someone to continue playing tennis, as becoming tired and developing tennis elbow are negative consequences, hunger is unrelated, and victory is not always guaranteed. Answer is
--target-- exercise

Options: A: deep breathing,B: worried,C: fall asleep,D: invigorating,E: feeling good, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sound James heard had a calming effect on him, to the point where he almost fell asleep despite his efforts to resist the urge.

These stores were typically found in small neighborhoods or downtown commercial areas, rather than in larger shopping malls or commercial buildings.

Answer is

Options: A: toy store,B: michigan,C: living room,D: attic,E: cupboard, Knowledge: An unused chess set is often stored in a place where it can be easily accessed when needed but is not taking up everyday space. The living room and cupboard are both places where items are often displayed or regularly used, so they may not be the best location for an unused chess set. Michigan is a state and not a location for storage. A toy store is a place where chess sets can be purchased, but not necessarily stored. An attic is a common location for storing items that are not needed often, but should be kept in a safe and dry place. Answer is

Teaching courses is a common responsibility of professors in universities and colleges. The other options either do not relate to the job of a professor (methods of facts, state facts) or are stereotypes that do not necessarily apply to all professors (wear wrinkled tweed jackets).

Options: A: intertidal zone,B: coral sea,C: under water,D: flower bed,E: florida keys, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that colorful anemones resemble an object commonly found in flower beds. Flower beds are known for containing a variety of colorful blooms, which may explain the comparison to colorful anemones. The other options, such as intertidal zones, coral seas, and under water, do not have any clear connection to flower beds or colorful objects. The Florida Keys may be known for their colorful sea life, but this option does not fit the comparison to an object found in a flower bed. Answer is

--input-- Question: From where do aliens arrive? Options: A: outer space,B: weekly world news,C: roswell,D: universe,E: mars, Knowledge: Aliens are typically believed to originate from beyond the Earth, in what is commonly referred to as outer space. While some conspiracy theories may suggest specific locations, such as Roswell, these claims are not proven and do not have broad scientific support. The universe as a whole could technically be considered the origin of all life, but in the context of the question, outer space is the most logical and likely answer. Mars is a planet in our solar system and while it has been explored by humans, there is no evidence to suggest it is a source of alien life. Weekly world news is a tabloid and not a credible source of information. Answer is
--target-- outer space

Options: A: apply for job,B: sleep,C: concentrate,D: shower,E: just do, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the action being referred to should occur before beginning work, and the context suggests that it is a personal hygiene routine.

Therefore, the correct answer is "shower." Answer is
--target-- shower

Options: A: living room,B: floor,C: warm place,D: carpet,E: farmhouse, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kitten was trying to stop, but because it had nothing to dig its claws into, it slid across something.

None of the other answer options have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- resistance

Encouraging children may be something a teacher does throughout the day, but specifically before nap time, telling a story is a common practice to help children relax and transition into a restful state. Lowering expectations and giving a time test would not be appropriate activities before nap time and could actually make children more anxious, while fear is not a positive emotion to associate with a teacher's actions. Answer is

Options: A: body of animal,B: arm,C: bodybuilder,D: body of dog,E: human body, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person is at the gym trying to build muscle, which implies that they are focusing on strengthening and developing their own muscles. The options "body of animal" and "body of dog" do not make sense in this context as it is unlikely that a person would be trying to build muscle on an animal's body. "Arm" is a body part that the person may be focusing on, but it only refers to a specific area and not the whole body. "Bodybuilder" is a term used to describe someone who actively participates in bodybuilding competitions, but it does not answer the question of what is being built.

The word "fishing" is also associated with leisure activities and outdoor recreation, which suggests that the man is seeking relaxation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: "food" does not explain why the man is skipping work, "killing" is not an appropriate reason for skipping work, "missing morning cartoons" is unrelated, and "boredom" suggests a lack of engagement with work rather than a deliberate choice to skip it. Answer is
--target-- relaxation

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, with "colorado" being a state and "world" and "outside" being too vague. "America" could have been a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Answer is

Options: A: mushroom,B: falling down,C: sweating,D: exhaustion,E: getting tired, Knowledge: Running requires physical exertion, and eventually, the body will reach a point where it can no longer continue due to exhaustion.

--target-- demonstration

Options: A: go fast,B: start running,C: going too fast,D: look good,E: last several years, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that buying a used car is a risky decision, but there is still a hope that the car will perform well over a long period of time. The option "go fast" is not relevant as the focus is on the longevity of the car, not its speed. "Start running" is not specific enough as all cars should start running if they are in good condition. "Going too fast" is not desirable as it suggests the car may have performance issues. "Look good" is subjective and does not relate to the car's performance. Answer is
--target-- last several years

Slowing down is a function of the car's brakes, which are designed to control its speed, but it is not the main purpose of the vehicle. Turning right is a maneuver that the car is capable of doing, but it is not its main purpose. Lastly, getting girls is not a function of cars; it is a subjective opinion or stereotype that does not relate to the actual purpose of a vehicle. Answer is
--target-- move people
--input-- Question: Alabama is full of different people, but they are all citizens of what? Options: A: united states,B: deep south,C: floribama,D: gulf states,E: florabama, Knowledge: The word "citizens" suggests that the question is asking about nationality or political affiliation.

--input-- Question: The gimmicky low brow TV show was about animals when they what? Options: A: sick,B: mammals,C: males,D: bite,E: attack, Knowledge: The adjective "gimmicky" suggests that the TV show was exaggerated or over-the-top in some way. Given the context of the sentence, it is likely that the show featured animals behaving in a sensational or exaggerated way. The words "sick," "mammals," and "males" do not provide any clear information about what the show was about, whereas "bite" and "attack" suggest that the show may have focused on aggressive or predatory animal behavior. In this case, "bite" is the better choice because it is less extreme than "attack" and more likely to be associated with sensational or gimmicky TV programming. Answer is
--target-- bite
--input-- Question: A loud machine is irritating, but many are expected where? Options: A: museum,B: house,C: laboratory,D: library,E: industrial area, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject of the sentence is a noisy machine that may be disruptive. The context of the sentence mentions that this type of machine is expected, which suggests that it is in a location where loud machines are common. Industrial areas, such as factories or manufacturing plants, are known for having loud and noisy equipment, which makes it the most likely choice out of the options provided. The other choices do not typically have loud machinery, and in fact, quiet and peaceful environments such as a museum, house, or library would likely oppose the presence of loud machines. Answer is

--input-- Question: What part of a table would you put a ruler in? Options: A: drawer,B: desk,C: the backside,D: office,E: measure distance, Knowledge: The question is asking where a ruler should be placed on a table.

The only option that refers to a flat surface is "desk," which is typically a flat work surface. The other options such as "drawer" or "the backside" do not make sense in the context of the question. "Office" is too broad of a category and "measure distance" is not a location. Answer is

The other options either do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or have a more positive connotation (e.g. strong feelings, excitement, arousal). Herpes may be a consequence of kissing if one of the participants has an active outbreak of the virus, but this would not necessarily be a result of kissing for too long. Answer is

As an individual learns, they are likely to acquire more knowledge and become more knowledgeable about that subject or topic. Therefore, the correct answer is "knowing more." "Overconfidence" is not a likely outcome of learning, as learning often involves recognizing one's limitations and areas for improvement. "Effectiveness" and "growth" may be outcomes of learning, but they are not as directly related to the process of learning itself. "Head grows larger" is not a likely outcome of learning in any way. Answer is
--target-- knowing more

Since the person had to sit right back down, it can be assumed that the problem was serious enough to prevent them from standing for longer periods of time.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

The most common place to clean dishes after dinner is in a dishwasher. The other options do not make logical sense, as a restaurant kitchen and party would not be where the family's dirty dishes would go, and loading the dishes in the son's room or cabinet would not be an appropriate chore after dinner. Answer is
--target-- dishwasher
--input-- Question: Where could you find a bureau as well as many politicians? Options: A: each city,B: office building,C: a zoo,D: french government,E: washington dc, Knowledge: The reference to politicians and a bureau suggests a location where government officials and agencies are located. French government could be an option, but there is a specific reference to a particular place, which is not the case with the generic term "each city." The zoo and office building are completely unrelated and do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- Washington DC
--input-- Question: Dad wanted to hide the check in his office, where did he put it? Options: A: cash register,B: desk drawer,C: fish tank,D: bank,E: pay envelope, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dad wanted to hide a check in his office, which implies that the dad intended to keep the check safe and secure. The most logical place to keep a valuable object like a check would be in a locked desk drawer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: For some reason she was devoid of regular emotions, buying products was the only way she could feel what? Options: A: pleasure,B: owning,C: debt,D: spending money,E: smart, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question has difficulty experiencing regular emotions, and therefore turns to buying products as a way to feel something. The option "pleasure" is the most fitting word to describe the feeling that someone might get from purchasing products. The other options, such as "owning" or "debt," do not make sense as a way to replace emotions or provide an outlet for feelings. The option "smart" may suggest a feeling of satisfaction or accomplishment from making a savvy purchase, but it does not fit with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- pleasure
--input-- Question: Where are horses judged on appearance? Options: A: race track,B: fair,C: raised by humans,D: in a field,E: countryside, Knowledge: Horses are often judged on their appearance at fairs, which are events where livestock are shown and judged based on their conformation, appearance, and other criteria. Race tracks are primarily used for horse racing and not for judging horses on their appearance. Horses raised by humans and those in fields may not necessarily be judged on their appearance. The countryside does not provide a clear indication of where horses are judged on their appearance. Answer is
--target-- fair

Options: A: having fun,B: it's more relatable,C: learn new things,D: becoming absorbed,E: falling asleep, Knowledge: Non-fiction is typically written to inform or educate the reader on a specific topic, making it an ideal choice for those who want to expand their knowledge on a subject. Non-fiction books may cover a wide range of topics, from history and science to self-help and biographies. While some non-fiction books may be enjoyable to read, the primary reason people typically choose to read non-fiction is to acquire new information or skills. The other options listed are not commonly associated with reading non-fiction. Answer is
--target-- learn new things
--input-- Question: While knitting you can do what using a radio? Options: A: listen to music,B: watch television,C: making blankets,D: eat,E: watching tv, Knowledge: Knitting is a relatively quiet and stationary activity, so it makes sense that a radio can be used to provide some background noise or entertainment while doing it. The other options don't seem as suitable for this context - watching TV, eating, or making blankets may require more attention and movement, and the sentence already mentions "knitting" so it's unlikely that the correct answer involves a different activity. Answer is
--target-- listen to music
--input-- Question: Where are you likely to set papers while working on them? Options: A: table,B: meeting,C: drawer,D: toilet,E: garage, Knowledge: This question is asking where papers are commonly placed while working on them, and the most logical answer is a table. Tables provide a flat surface to work on and are commonly found in homes and offices. A meeting, drawer, toilet, or garage are not typically used for working on papers, making them unlikely answers. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: John had a massive debt to 50 million dollars.  Compared to that, Leo's 2000 dollar debt seemed what? Options: A: dwarf,B: inconsequential,C: insubstantial,D: lame,E: tiny, Knowledge: The sentence sets up a comparison between John's debt of 50 million dollars and Leo's debt of 2000 dollars, implying that there is a significant difference in scale between the two. The word "massive" further emphasizes the size of John's debt, making the other options - "dwarf," "inconsequential," "insubstantial," and "lame" - inappropriate choices. "Tiny" accurately conveys the sense of insignificance of Leo's debt compared to John's. Answer is
--target-- tiny
--input-- Question: The man flew his airplane over the city and saw pollution visibly in the sky, what was polluted? Options: A: forest,B: street,C: air,D: caused by humans,E: car show, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man saw pollution in the sky while flying his airplane over the city. The other options are not likely to be associated with pollution in the sky. Forests and streets are typically associated with ground-level pollution, and car shows are usually a type of event rather than a source of pollution. The phrase "caused by humans" is too general to be a specific answer to the question. Answer is
--target-- air
--input-- Question: What is a very unlikely side effect of becoming inebriated? Options: A: fights,B: drunkenness,C: staggering,D: puke,E: paralysis, Knowledge: Becoming inebriated (i.e. drunk) can result in various side effects such as fights, drunkenness, staggering, and puking. However, paralysis is a highly unlikely side effect and does not have any clear connection to alcohol consumption. It is therefore the correct answer to the question. Answer is
--target-- paralysis
--input-- Question: when communicating with my boss what should i do Options: A: misunderstandings,B: transfer of information,C: learning,D: confusion,E: silence, Knowledge: The question asks about communication with a boss, which suggests that the focus should be on exchanging information or ideas. The phrase "transfer of information" directly refers to the act of conveying information from one person to another, making it the most appropriate choice. "Misunderstandings" and "confusion" suggest a breakdown in communication, while "learning" may not have a clear connection to the situation. "Silence" is not a proactive approach to communication and will not help in achieving the desired outcome. Answer is
--target-- transfer of information
--input-- Question: If not in a stream but in a market where will you find fish? Options: A: stream,B: aquarium,C: refrigerator,D: boat ride,E: market, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location being discussed is a market, and the question is asking where fish can be found in that market. The other options (stream, aquarium, boat ride) are locations where one might find fish, but they are not appropriate answers to the question being asked. The answer is therefore the option that is explicitly mentioned in the question. Answer is
--target-- market
--input-- Question: What are people likely to want to do with their friends? Options: A: own land,B: own home,C: talk to each other,D: believe in god,E: spend time, Knowledge: While owning land or a home, talking to each other, and believing in god may all be activities that people do with friends, spending time is a more general choice that encompasses many possibilities. Spending time may include going to the movies, playing games, going out to eat, or any number of other social activities that people do with their friends. The other options are more specific and do not apply to all types of friendships or social situations. Answer is
--target-- spend time
--input-- Question: During a shark filled tornado where should you not be? Options: A: marine museum,B: pool hall,C: noodle house,D: bad movie,E: outside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a dangerous situation involving sharks and tornadoes.

Answer is
--target-- outside
--input-- Question: What is the likely result of buying products in excess? Options: A: running out of money,B: spending money,C: poverty,D: comparison shopping,E: overstocking, Knowledge: Buying products in excess means purchasing more than what is needed, which will eventually result in using up all the available funds, leading to a shortage of money. This can lead to financial strains and difficulties paying for necessities. Spending money is not a likely result because it is a given that money will be spent when buying products. Poverty is a possible outcome, but it is too extreme and not necessarily a direct result of buying products in excess. Comparison shopping is a strategy used to save money while overstocking is the opposite of buying products in excess. Answer is
--target-- running out of money
--input-- Question: What is a person trying to accomplish when taking analgesics? Options: A: acceptance,B: avoid pain,C: acknowledgment,D: passing grade,E: intellectual challenge, Knowledge: Analgesics are medicines used to relieve pain. The context of the sentence implies that the person is taking these medicines in order to achieve a certain goal, which can be inferred from the choices given. Acceptance, acknowledgment, passing grade, and intellectual challenge do not relate to the purpose of taking analgesics, while avoiding pain is a common reason for taking them. Answer is
--target-- avoid pain
--input-- Question: Where would you put a glass after drinking from it? Options: A: ocean,B: water cooler,C: cabinet,D: dishwasher,E: dining room, Knowledge: After drinking from a glass, one would typically place it in a location for cleaning or storage. The options "ocean" and "water cooler" do not make sense in this context, as they are not places for glassware. "Dining room" could be a possible location, but it is not specific enough. "Dishwasher" and "cabinet" are commonly used places to store or clean glassware after use, making them the most likely answers. Answer is
--target-- dishwasher or cabinet
--input-- Question: Where would you buy food? Options: A: freezer,B: store,C: home,D: hatred,E: kitchen, Knowledge: The word "buy" suggests that the question is related to purchasing food, which is typically done at a store.

--target-- store
--input-- Question: When a person admits his mistakes, what are they doing? Options: A: accident,B: learn to swim,C: thank god,D: feel relieved,E: act responsibly, Knowledge: Admitting one's mistakes is a responsible behavior as it shows an individual is willing to take ownership of their actions and their consequences. The other options do not fit into the context of admitting one's mistakes. An accident is an unforeseeable event, learning to swim is unrelated to admitting mistakes, thanking God may show gratitude but does not relate to taking responsibility, and feeling relieved may only be a byproduct of admitting mistakes, not the purpose behind it. Answer is
--target-- act responsibly
--input-- Question: Where do play a game for money? Options: A: casino,B: football ground,C: ballpark,D: family room,E: toy store, Knowledge: Playing games for money is a common practice in casinos, which are establishments that offer various forms of gambling activities.

--target-- casino
--input-- Question: When you travel you should what in case of unexpected costs? Options: A: go somewhere,B: energy,C: spend frivilously,D: fly in airplane,E: have money, Knowledge: The question is asking what you should do in case of unexpected costs when traveling. The only logical answer is to have money readily available to cover those costs. Going somewhere, energy, and flying in an airplane are not relevant to the question, and spending frivolously could actually cause more financial trouble in the long run. Having money is the most practical and responsible option for dealing with unexpected expenses while traveling. Answer is
--target-- have money
--input-- Question: Donald is a prominent figure for the federal government, so in what city does he likely spend a lot of time? Options: A: everything,B: capitol building,C: tourist sites,D: canada,E: washington d.c, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Donald is a prominent figure for the federal government, which is primarily based in Washington D.C.

--input-- Question: There was more than one bum asking for change or a ticket, it was the cheapest way to travel so it was no surprise sight at the what? Options: A: train station,B: beach,C: bus depot,D: bridge,E: stumblebum, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bums were asking for change or a ticket, which implies that they were trying to travel by public transportation. The cheapest way to travel by public transportation is often by bus, so it makes sense that the sight of beggars asking for change or a ticket would be common at a bus depot. The other options, such as a train station or a beach, do not have the same connection to public transportation or the idea of traveling on a budget. Answer is
--target-- bus depot
--input-- Question: John and Joe like planning games but Joe  was hit by a ball and fell down. What might have happened to Joe. Options: A: anger,B: good natured ribbing.,C: enjoying,D: injury,E: enjoyment, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Joe was hit by a ball and fell down while he and John were playing planning games.

Answer is
--target-- injury
--input-- Question: Where can you buy jeans at one of may indoor merchants? Options: A: gap,B: shopping mall,C: bedroom,D: laundromat,E: bathroom, Knowledge: The phrase "indoor merchants" suggests that the location being described is a place where multiple vendors sell their products under one roof. A common example of such a location is a shopping mall. Additionally, the option "gap" is a specific brand of clothing, and the options "bedroom" and "bathroom" are private spaces unlikely to have multiple jeans vendors. Only "shopping mall" fits the given context. Answer is
--target-- shopping mall
--input-- Question: What do you write letter in in America? Options: A: syllable,B: post office,C: envelope,D: english alphabet,E: word, Knowledge: The question is asking about the physical object that is used to send a letter in America.

Options: A: anterior,B: front,C: main,D: front,E: current, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe owes taxes, specifically "back" taxes and another type of tax.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of taxes owed. Answer is
--target-- current
--input-- Question: Where is a broadcast studio likely to be heard? Options: A: microphone,B: arena,C: radio station,D: trees,E: town, Knowledge: A broadcast studio is a place where radio or TV shows are produced and recorded. Therefore, it is likely to be heard on a radio station or seen on a TV channel. A microphone is a device used for capturing sound, but it is not necessarily associated with the location where the sound is transmitted. An arena is a large venue where sports or entertainment events are held and is not commonly associated with broadcasting. Trees and town are also not related to the concept of broadcasting. Answer is
--target-- radio station

A coffee table book is typically defined as a large, visually appealing book meant to be displayed on a coffee table for guests to browse through. This could potentially be the type of book that Kramer wrote as it would be a good fit for a self-referential theme. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- coffee table
--input-- Question: Of all the sports, Billy enjoys football, but what does his concerned mother think of the sport? Options: A: very entertaining,B: fun,C: slow,D: competitive,E: violent, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's mother has some concerns about football as a sport, which is often associated with violent tackles and injuries.

Options: A: chicago,B: big city,C: large city building,D: environment,E: college campus, Knowledge: The question asks for the city that is likely to have many parking structures.

--target-- chicago
--input-- Question: Sally was afraid of danger and always double checked what? Options: A: fight enemy,B: secure,C: being safe,D: safety,E: vicinity, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally has a fear of danger and actively takes steps to avoid it. The options "fight enemy" and "vicinity" do not fit with the idea of avoiding danger, while "secure" is too broad and could refer to many different things. "Being safe" and "safety" both directly relate to the sense of safety and avoiding danger, making them the most likely correct answer options. Answer is
--target-- safety
--input-- Question: What is the habitat of the fox? Options: A: hen house,B: burrow,C: california,D: england,E: mountains, Knowledge: Foxes are known for living in burrows or dens, which they dig themselves or take over from other animals. This is a common trait among many species of foxes and is essential to their survival as it provides protection from predators and harsh weather. The other options, such as hen house, California, England, and mountains, do not match the typical habitat of foxes. Answer is
--target-- burrow
--input-- Question: People are very much like the animals, but one thing has secured or dominance over the planet.  We're better at doing what? Options: A: eat eggs,B: make tools,C: eat dosa,D: talk to each other,E: smoke pot, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that sets humans apart from animals, and this something has allowed them to become dominant on the planet. The options "eat eggs," "eat dosa," and "smoke pot" have no obvious connection to the sentence. "Talk to each other" may be a possibility, but the tone of the sentence suggests that the thing that sets humans apart is something more concrete. "Make tools" is a common characteristic cited by anthropologists and historians as the factor that allowed humans to develop and dominate over other species. Answer is
--target-- make tools
--input-- Question: They children loved having a back yard, and the parents loved that it was a safe what? Options: A: suburb,B: neighborhood,C: back of house,D: roundabout,E: property, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family enjoyed having a backyard in a specific type of area that was safe. Suburbs and neighborhoods are commonly associated with having safe environments for families, while "back of house" and "roundabout" do not make sense in this context. "Property" could work, but it does not specify the type of area or neighborhood they are in. Answer is
--target-- neighborhood
--input-- Question: While people just throw coins down them now, what originally had a pail to be lowered for it's intended use? Options: A: garage,B: utility room,C: slide,D: wishing well,E: garden, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the object in question was originally used for something other than collecting coins. The phrase "pail to be lowered" suggests that the object was used for retrieving something from a deep location. A wishing well fits this description as people could throw coins in it to make a wish and the coins would be retrieved from the bottom using a pail on a rope. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- wishing well
--input-- Question: Joe was thrown from his boat into the water.  The water was cold because it was the middle of winter and he cried out to his crew for help.  They couldn't hear him over the sound of the what? Options: A: surface of earth,B: teardrops,C: snowflake,D: typhoon,E: motor, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was in a body of water and there was a crew with him. The fact that Joe cried out for help implies that there was some sort of noise or disturbance going on. The sentence also mentions it was the middle of winter, which indicates that there may have been some weather-related conditions affecting the situation. The option "motor" is the most likely answer as it could be creating noise and disturbance in the water, making it difficult for Joe's cries for help to be heard. The other options have no clear relevance to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- motor
--input-- Question: When a human is earning money, where are they often found? Options: A: deep thought,B: park,C: friend's house,D: place of work,E: school, Knowledge: The term "earning money" typically refers to someone working and receiving payment for their job. Therefore, the correct answer is likely a location associated with work. "Deep thought" and "park" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Friend's house" may be a location where someone spends leisure time, but it is unlikely to be related to earning money. "School" is a place where people may learn and develop skills, but it is not necessarily where they earn money. Answer is
--target-- place of work

Options: A: maryland,B: indiana,C: on tv,D: park,E: new jersey, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that they were on their way to watch a motorsport event, but they passed an apple tree, which indicates that they were not physically going to the event location. The only option that fits this context is "on tv", as it implies that they were going to watch the event from the comfort of their own home or another location, rather than actually attending it in person. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- on tv
--input-- Question: Why do people play chess on the weekends? Options: A: satisfaction,B: have fun,C: thrilling,D: made,E: smart, Knowledge: The sentence implies that people play chess on the weekends for a specific reason, and one that may not necessarily be related to having fun or seeking a thrilling experience. The word "satisfaction" suggests that the act of playing chess gives individuals a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment, which could be a motivating factor for why they choose to play on the weekends. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for the reason behind playing chess on weekends. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: What do you need energy to do in gym class? Options: A: work,B: tacos,C: mass,D: play sports,E: wrestle, Knowledge: Gym class typically involves physical activity such as playing sports, running, and other exercises that require energy.

Options: A: game,B: pouch,C: home,D: store,E: jar, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah dropped the marble intentionally, likely because she was playing a game.

Options: A: write,B: eat cake,C: smile,D: think critically,E: die, Knowledge: The sentence implies that all humans share a common experience or fate, which is something that we all do or will do. The options "write," "eat cake," and "smile" do not reflect a universal experience or fate, while "think critically" may be too specific or subjective to apply universally. "Die" is a universal experience that all humans share, regardless of culture, language, or belief system. Answer is
--target-- die
--input-- Question: If a person were going to bed, what would be their goal? Options: A: lazy,B: insomnia,C: rest,D: falling asleep,E: dreaming of, Knowledge: Going to bed usually implies the intention of getting some rest and preparing to sleep.

The other options do not reflect a typical bedtime goal, as being lazy, having insomnia, or dreaming are not necessarily the intended outcomes of getting into bed. Answer is
--target-- falling asleep
--input-- Question: What are candles good for eliminating? Options: A: shelf,B: board,C: church,D: table,E: dark, Knowledge: The question asks about the purpose of candles and specifically asks about something that they eliminate.

Options: A: night sky,B: galaxy,C: outer space,D: hollywood,E: eat cake, Knowledge: Stars are located in outer space, which is the vast expanse beyond our planet Earth.

--input-- Question: The player lifted his cornet and walked in rhythm, what was the player a member of? Options: A: museum,B: high school band,C: marching band,D: orchestra,E: band, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a player lifting a cornet and walking in rhythm, which is indicative of musical performance. The options "museum" and "high school band" do not make sense in this context, as the former does not involve musical performance and the latter would likely have been mentioned specifically as a separate option. "Marching band" makes sense as a possible choice, as it involves playing instruments while walking in a synchronized manner. However, the use of the term "player" instead of "marcher" suggests that the sentence is referring to a more general type of musical group, which is why "band" and "orchestra" are both plausible options. Answer is
--target-- band
--input-- Question: What happens at soon as a living being is born? Options: A: expiration,B: growing older,C: sometimes bad,D: death,E: start reproduction, Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens immediately after a living being is born, and one of the most common things is that they start to grow and mature. This is supported by the fact that the other options (expiration, death, start reproduction) are events that occur later in the life cycle, while "sometimes bad" is too vague and does not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- growing older
--input-- Question: When someone is talking and you missed something, what can you do to get them to repeat it? Options: A: walking,B: ask question,C: think,D: write question in crayon,E: sneeze, Knowledge: Asking a question is a common and appropriate way to clarify information that was missed during a conversation. It indicates a desire for understanding and encourages the speaker to provide more information. Walking, thinking, and sneezing are not effective methods for requesting a repetition of information, and writing a question in crayon is not a realistic or appropriate option for most conversational situations. Answer is
--target-- ask question
--input-- Question: Where does one store fabric in their own home? Options: A: sewing room,B: clothing store,C: tailor shop,D: clothes store,E: cotton mill, Knowledge: The question refers to the storage of fabric in a personal or home setting. The most appropriate and common place to store fabric in a home would be a sewing room where someone has space to store and work with their materials. The other options may have fabric, but they are not typically places where one would store their personal fabric collection. A clothing store or clothes store would only have fabric for sale, and a tailor shop may have fabric but it would be primarily used for alterations or repairs. A cotton mill is a manufacturing facility for making fabric, not a place to store it in a personal setting. Answer is
--target-- sewing room
--input-- Question: What do most companies not want to have relative to demand? Options: A: oversupply,B: plentitude,C: stockpile,D: superabundance,E: busy, Knowledge: The sentence is discussing what companies do not want to have "relative to demand," which suggests that the correct answer is related to the concept of supply and demand. Of the options given, "oversupply" is the only one directly related to the concept of having more of a product than is needed or desired, which is not desirable for companies as it can lead to waste and decreased profitability. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- oversupply
--input-- Question: What is happening while he's playing basketball for such a long time? Options: A: sweating,B: pain,C: having fun,D: medium,E: knee injury, Knowledge: The context suggests that the person playing basketball is doing it for a long time, implying that they are likely enjoying themselves. The other options do not necessarily relate to the act of playing basketball specifically. Sweating and knee injury may occur during basketball, but they don't necessarily describe what's happening while the person is playing for a long time. Pain is too broad and can't be assumed without more information. Medium is unrelated and doesn't make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- having fun
--input-- Question: A traveler laments the fact that mass transit is limited in his city when his groceries get soaked by the rain as he waits where? Options: A: bus stop,B: library,C: motel,D: airport,E: subway, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the traveler was waiting for some form of public transportation when the rain caused their groceries to get soaked. The options "library," "motel," "airport," and "subway" do not fit this context because they do not typically have areas designated for waiting for public transportation. "Bus stop" is the only option that fits this context and would be a likely place for someone to wait for mass transit. Answer is
--target-- bus stop
--input-- Question: The person was in physical distress, where should he go? Options: A: synagogue,B: for help,C: hospital,D: bus stop,E: building, Knowledge: The phrase "physical distress" implies a medical emergency or injury that requires urgent attention. A hospital is a facility equipped to provide medical care and treatment for such situations, while the other options (synagogue, bus stop, building) are not specifically related to medical assistance. "For help" is too general and does not provide any specific information about the kind of help required, so it cannot be the correct answer. Answer is

Making out a will involves determining who will receive a person's possessions and assets after their death. The other options are either unrelated to the context of the sentence or inappropriate in this context. Answer is

Options: A: listening,B: language,C: looking at eyes,D: planning the perfect murder,E: voice, Knowledge: When someone is talking to another person, it is generally expected that the other person will be listening to what is being said.

Clouding over refers to the process of clouds forming and thickening, which is often a precursor to rainfall. In contrast, the other options do not accurately describe the behavior of the sky before a rain. Appearing beautiful or blue are aesthetic descriptions, while showing a rainbow occurs during or after the rain. Rain water is a consequence of the rain, rather than a behavior of the sky. Answer is
--target-- cloud over
--input-- Question: Pens, computers, text books and paper clips can all be found where? Options: A: desktop,B: university,C: drawer,D: table,E: work, Knowledge: The items listed in the question are all commonly found on a desktop, which is a surface where a person typically works or studies. The other options may also contain some of these items, but they do not necessarily indicate where all the listed items can be found. "University" implies a specific location, while "drawer" and "table" do not provide enough context to indicate where all the listed items can be found. "Work" is too general and does not specify a specific location. Answer is
--target-- desktop
--input-- Question: What geographic area is a lizard likely to be? Options: A: ball stopped,B: west texas,C: arid regions,D: garden,E: warm place, Knowledge: Lizards are known to thrive in warm and dry climates, which is why they are commonly found in arid regions such as deserts. The other options (ball stopped, garden) do not have any clear connection to the habitat or environment that is suitable for lizards. West Texas and warm place are somewhat related, as West Texas is known for its hot and dry climate, but arid regions is a more specific and accurate answer. Answer is
--target-- arid regions
--input-- Question: What do you use to carry your briefcase? Options: A: office building,B: school,C: courtroom,D: airport,E: hand, Knowledge: The question asks about the tool used to carry a briefcase, and out of the given options, only "hand" is a viable choice.

--input-- Question: He picked up his pace to a run, he wanted to do what? Options: A: learn to walk,B: frightened,C: get away from,D: exercise,E: go faster, Knowledge: The sentence describes someone increasing their speed from walking to running, which suggests that the person wants to move quickly. The phrase "picked up his pace" implies a desire to increase speed, and "to a run" indicates that the person is running as fast as they can. The other options do not fit with the context of someone increasing their speed to a run. Answer is
--target-- go faster
--input-- Question: What would a person do if they do not have any friends? Options: A: talk to people,B: try again,C: fall asleep,D: stand alone,E: thank god, Knowledge: This question is asking for a solution to a problem, which is not having any friends. The most logical solution would be to try to make new friends by talking to people. This option is the only one that presents a proactive solution to the problem. "Try again" is too vague and doesn't offer any specific action, while "fall asleep" and "stand alone" do not offer any solutions to the problem at all. "Thank god" is not relevant to the question. Answer is
--target-- talk to people
--input-- Question: As a result of dying, what happens to organic material? Options: A: change of color,B: stop breathing,C: wake up,D: death and decay,E: getting cold, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something will happen to organic material as a result of dying, which implies a process of decomposition. The phrase "death and decay" is often used to describe the natural process by which a deceased organism breaks down and returns to the earth. The other options do not accurately describe the process of dying and its effects on organic material. Answer is
--target-- death and decay
--input-- Question: What does everyone have in relation to other people? Options: A: feelings,B: food,C: unique personality,D: different standards,E: values, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is something that all people have in common when it comes to their relationships with others. Since the other options do not relate to relationships or social interactions, we can eliminate them. Unique personalities and different standards are individual traits that are likely to vary from person to person. While values may also be shared by many individuals, they are not necessarily related specifically to interpersonal relationships. Lastly, food is not a trait that everyone possesses in relation to others. Therefore, the correct answer is that feelings, such as emotions and empathy, are something that everyone has in common when it comes to interacting with others. Answer is
--target-- feelings
--input-- Question: What do you ask a child to do when you first meet her? Options: A: ask questions,B: count to ten,C: costume,D: state name,E: dress herself, Knowledge: When first meeting a child, it is common to ask their name to begin the conversation and establish a connection. The other options, such as asking questions or counting to ten, may come later in the conversation or interaction but would not be the first thing you ask a child. Costume and dress herself do not make sense in this context as they are not related to initial introductions. Answer is
--target-- state name
--input-- Question: Where can you buy a clock, clothing and wrenches? Options: A: counter,B: train station,C: school room,D: desk,E: department store, Knowledge: The items listed - clock, clothing, and wrenches - are commonly found in a department store, which typically carries a wide variety of products for sale. The other options do not make as much sense, as a counter or desk may only offer a limited selection of items, a train station typically only sells transportation-related items or snacks, and a school room is not typically a place where items are sold. Answer is
--target-- department store
--input-- Question: What do you do when you're in a new place and want to see new things? Options: A: interesting,B: look around,C: take pictures,D: change of surroundings,E: new experience, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to see new things in a new place, which can be achieved by looking around and exploring the area. This option is the most straightforward and logical choice. Taking pictures and experiencing new things are both possible outcomes of exploring a new place, but they are not the main action being described in the sentence. "Interesting" and "change of surroundings" are both vague and do not provide a clear action that can be taken to see new things in a new place. Answer is
--target-- look around
--input-- Question: What happens when to ice when it is in the sun? Options: A: carved,B: melted,C: ice cream,D: antarctica,E: sculptured, Knowledge: Ice is known to melt when exposed to the sun's heat. When ice melts, it turns into water due to the increase in temperature. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Ice might be sculptured or carved, but not necessarily as a result of being in the sun. Ice cream is made from milk, sugar, and cream, and has nothing to do with the sun. Finally, Antarctica is a continent covered in ice, but the answer should be related to what happens to ice when exposed to the sun. Answer is
--target-- melted
--input-- Question: Where can you store your dishes in your dwelling? Options: A: drawer,B: shelf,C: pantry,D: apartment,E: cabinet, Knowledge: The other options (drawer, shelf, pantry) may be used for storing dishes as well, but a cabinet specifically designed for storing dishes is a more appropriate answer. Cabinets are commonly found in kitchens and dining areas and are often equipped with shelves, compartments, and slots for organizing dishes of various shapes and sizes. The option "apartment" is not applicable because it refers to a type of dwelling, not a storage location. Answer is
--target-- cabinet
--input-- Question: The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man? Options: A: niagra falls,B: forest,C: waterfall,D: ground,E: tree, Knowledge: The sentence mentions the man laying on a soft surface, which suggests that he is on the ground. Additionally, the man looks up at the trees, which suggests that he is not in a tree or on top of a waterfall. Niagara Falls is not mentioned in the sentence, and while the man is in a forest, the question specifically asks for his location within the forest, which is on the ground. Answer is
--target-- ground
--input-- Question: What is someone doing if he or she is sitting quietly and his or her eyes are moving? Options: A: reading,B: meditate,C: fall asleep,D: bunk,E: think, Knowledge: The description of a person sitting quietly and their eyes moving suggests that they are in a state of deep concentration or mindfulness. This is a common practice in meditation, where the person may sit quietly and focus their attention on their breath, mantra, or other object of contemplation while their eyes move naturally. The other options do not fit with the description of someone in a meditative state, such as reading or falling asleep. Answer is
--target-- meditate
--input-- Question: Where can I find a stapler in many places? Options: A: desk drawer,B: office building,C: manual,D: office supply store,E: desktop, Knowledge: The question is asking where a stapler can be found in many places, implying that the answer should refer to a location that is easily accessible in multiple settings. The desk drawer and desktop are specific to individual workstations, while the office building and manual are too broad and do not necessarily guarantee the presence of staplers. The office supply store, on the other hand, is a likely location where customers can expect to find a variety of office supplies, including staplers. Answer is
--target-- office supply store
--input-- Question: A man takes a seat at a museum outside of Barcelona, where is he likely? Options: A: in cinema,B: martorell,C: falling down,D: show,E: airplane, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the man is at a museum outside Barcelona. Martorell is a town located outside of Barcelona that has several museums, including the Museu de Martorell and the Museu de la Lliça.

--target-- martorell
--input-- Question: Where would you find a toy soldier that is being played with? Options: A: toy box,B: movies,C: child's hand,D: toybos,E: child park, Knowledge: The phrase "being played with" suggests that the toy soldier is currently in use, and the most likely place for it to be is in a child's hand. The other options are less likely, as a toy box may contain unused toys, movies do not involve physical toys, and toybos and child park are not commonly associated with the act of playing with a toy soldier. Answer is
--target-- child's hand
--input-- Question: Where are you when you're about to use your plane ticket? Options: A: pocket,B: terrorists hands,C: airport,D: sea ship,E: briefcase, Knowledge: A plane ticket is generally used to board an airplane for travel.

--target-- airport

Options: A: market,B: table,C: countryside,D: anthology,E: vase, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject is discussing the placement and arrangement of flowers, which usually involves using a vase as a vessel to hold the flowers. The other options, such as market or anthology, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Moreover, "table" and "countryside" could be associated with arranging flowers but, unlike "vase", they are not objects used for this purpose. Answer is
--target-- vase
--input-- Question: How can a human cross a river and not mess up their hair? Options: A: wisconsin,B: waterfall,C: hatred,D: bridge,E: valley, Knowledge: The question implies that the person wants to cross a river without getting their hair messed up, indicating that they care about their appearance. Using a bridge would be the most practical way to cross a river while maintaining a hairstyle, as it allows a person to walk across without getting wet or tangled up in vegetation. The other options (Wisconsin, waterfall, hatred, valley) are not relevant to the question and do not provide any clues to the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- bridge
--input-- Question: Batman bought beer.  There were no bottles available.  He had to settle for what?. Options: A: shelf,B: soccer game,C: keg,D: can,E: refrigerator, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Batman had to settle for something, indicating that he was looking for a specific type of container to hold his beer. The options "shelf," "soccer game," and "refrigerator" are not containers and are therefore unlikely choices. A keg is a large container typically used for serving beer at a party, which may not be practical for one person to consume alone. A can is a small, single-serving container commonly used for holding beer, making it the most likely choice for Batman in this scenario. Answer is
--target-- can
--input-- Question: You can find a monkey in what West African region on the Gulf of Guinea Options: A: south american country,B: rain forest,C: pay debts,D: works,E: nigeria, Knowledge: The sentence specifically mentions a West African region on the Gulf of Guinea, which indicates that the answer is likely related to geography. The phrase "you can find a monkey" suggests that the question is about the distribution or habitat of a particular species. West Africa is home to many primates, including monkeys, and the rain forest is a common habitat for these animals. The other options are either not related to West Africa or do not have any connection to monkeys or their habitat. Answer is
--target-- rain forest
--input-- Question: Surprising an angry person could lead to what? Options: A: humor,B: fight,C: jocose,D: laughter,E: accidents, Knowledge: The word "angry" suggests a negative emotional state that often leads to aggression, and surprising someone in this state can potentially exacerbate this aggression. It is possible that the other options, such as humor or laughter, may diffuse the anger, but it is unlikely that they would be the most common or expected outcomes in this context. "Fight" is the most reasonable choice given the potentially volatile nature of an angry person. Answer is
--target-- fight
--input-- Question: Where is a dining area likely to be small? Options: A: cruise ship,B: home,C: mall,D: restaurant,E: dark cave, Knowledge: Cruise ships are notorious for their limited space, particularly in passenger cabins where dining areas may also be located. As a result, dining areas on cruise ships are often small in size. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- cruise ship
--input-- Question: Killing people should not cause what emotion? Options: A: vengeance,B: going to prison,C: joy,D: afraid,E: terrible, Knowledge: Killing people is a serious crime and a morally reprehensible act. It is unlikely for someone to feel joy in such a situation, as it goes against most social and cultural norms. In fact, killing people often creates a sense of guilt and fear of punishment (like going to prison) in the person who committed the act. Seeking vengeance could be a possible motive for killing someone, but it is not an emotion that one experiences in the aftermath of the act. "Afraid" and "terrible" may describe the emotions of the victim or those who witness the act, but not of the person who committed it. Answer is
--target-- joy

Options: A: exhilaration,B: interactions,C: head injuries,D: death,E: having fun, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James has collided with someone playing football multiple times, and he is worried about the consequences. Given the physical nature of football, the most likely consequence is some kind of injury, and the fact that the sentence specifically mentions "not for the first time" suggests that this is an ongoing issue. Head injuries are a particularly serious concern in contact sports like football, as they can lead to long-term health problems. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
--target-- head injuries
--input-- Question: More people should lower the guard and just have fun, we don't got long just what? Options: A: enjoy living,B: happy,C: enjoyable,D: get laid,E: do enjoy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker believes people should prioritize enjoying their lives and having fun, rather than being overly cautious or guarded. The phrase "we don't got long" implies a sense of urgency or the idea that life is short, which reinforces the importance of enjoying life. The other answer choices are either too specific (such as "get laid") or don't quite capture the sentiment of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- enjoy living
--input-- Question: Where can you get a lizard to keep in your home? Options: A: desert country,B: dessert,C: pet shop,D: tropical areas,E: zoo, Knowledge: The question pertains to acquiring a pet lizard, which would typically be sold in a pet shop. The other choices, such as dessert or desert country, are not locations where pet lizards are commonly found or sold. Tropical areas may be a viable option, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer. The zoo is also not relevant, as it is a place to see animals but not to purchase them as pets. Answer is
--target-- pet shop
--input-- Question: What would use a musical instrument? Options: A: guitar,B: music room,C: orchestra,D: case,E: movie, Knowledge: A musical instrument would refer to an object that produces sound or music when played. The guitar is a common example of a musical instrument. The other options, such as music room or case, do not refer to the object that produces sound but rather the location where music is played or stored. Orchestra refers to a group of musicians playing together, and movie does not give any indication about the object being talked about. Answer is
--target-- guitar
--input-- Question: She was in an affair, what did that end upon discovery by her husband? Options: A: relationship,B: marriage,C: fidelity,D: love,E: divorce, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the affair was not known to the husband before its discovery, and the consequences of discovering it resulted in the end of something. Since the wife was in a committed relationship with her husband, the most likely option would be the end of their marriage. The other choices may also be affected by discovering an affair, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
--target-- marriage
--input-- Question: What is the most famous constellation out of earth? Options: A: one moon,B: milky way,C: god's creation,D: stars,E: universe, Knowledge: The question is asking for the most famous constellation out of earth, which implies that it is visible from Earth. The Milky Way is not a constellation, but a galaxy that Earth is a part of. "God's creation" is too vague and doesn't refer to any specific astronomical object. "Universe" is too broad and refers to everything that exists, not just constellations. "One moon" is not a constellation either, but a natural satellite of Earth. "Stars" is the best answer because constellations are made up of stars and some of the most famous constellations include Orion, Ursa Major, and Cassiopeia. Answer is
--target-- stars
--input-- Question: If a reception is held with hotel guests walking by, what is the likely venue? Options: A: room service,B: church basement,C: lobby,D: large room,E: country club, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that hotel guests will be walking by during the reception, implying that the venue is located in a common area of the hotel. The most likely location for this would be the lobby, as it is a central gathering spot for hotel guests. Room service and church basements are unlikely venues for a hotel reception, while a large room and country club may be possible options but are not as strongly suggested by the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- lobby

--target-- friend's house
--input-- Question: If a court case is dismissed after hearing testimony, what would be a likely cause? Options: A: change of heart,B: anguish,C: anger,D: boredom,E: anxiety, Knowledge: The word "dismissed" suggests that the court case was ended prematurely, which may imply that the judge or jury was not invested in the case. The other options do not logically fit with the context of the sentence. "Change of heart" implies a reversal of opinion, which is not relevant in this context. "Anguish" and "anxiety" suggest emotional distress, which is not necessarily related to the outcome of a court case. "Anger" could potentially be a cause of a court case being dismissed, but it is not as likely as "boredom" in this scenario. Answer is
--target-- boredom
--input-- Question: Sitting down quickly after eating beans could lead to what? Options: A: flatulence,B: happiness,C: laziness,D: fall asleep,E: comfort, Knowledge: The question implies that there is a specific consequence that may occur if someone sits down quickly after consuming beans.

Options: A: table,B: office,C: desk,D: kitchen,E: ocean, Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a location where people typically want to have a lot of coffee.

--target-- kitchen
--input-- Question: You stop and have food all around you, what are you? Options: A: stay alive,B: wanted to survive,C: nutrition,D: grew,E: full, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is surrounded by food, which is a source of nutrition. "Stay alive" and "wanted to survive" may also be true, but they are not the best answer because they do not directly relate to the context of the sentence. "Grew" and "full" do not make sense because the sentence is referring to the act of eating or having access to food, not the physical attributes of the person. Answer is
--target-- nutrition
--input-- Question: James was meeting a friend.  They had planed a slow day. They didn't want to do much.  They just wanted what? Options: A: relaxation,B: panic,C: alarm,D: joy,E: cheer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James and his friend did not want to do much on their planned slow day, which indicates a desire for relaxation.

Options: A: sturdy,B: faithful,C: bound,D: compact,E: packaged, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs a small car, which implies that compact would be the correct answer. Sturdy and faithful are characteristics that are more commonly associated with reliability and durability, and bound and packaged have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- compact

Options: A: arizona,B: farm yard,C: michigan,D: german field,E: dairy farm, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is a farmer and has a heifer which he keeps for milk. The sentence also implies that Dan lives in a place which is cold and where finding good farmland may be difficult. Among the given options, Michigan is known for its cold climate and is also a state with a significant farming industry, making it a likely candidate. The other options do not match the context given in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- michigan

Options: A: hatred,B: sleeping in,C: rest,D: making love,E: insomnia, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Alice is intentionally delaying going to bed on Friday night because she plans on doing something specific on Saturday. "Sleeping in" is a common phrase that refers to staying in bed longer than usual in the morning, and it makes sense in the context of someone wanting to enjoy their weekend by getting more rest. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or would be unlikely for Alice to do based on the information provided. Answer is
--target-- sleeping in

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- map

Options: A: car stand,B: at hotel,C: own home,D: front door,E: bus depot, Knowledge: A personal key is typically used to unlock a front door of a home or apartment. The other options, such as a car stand or bus depot, are not commonly associated with personal keys as they usually require a different type of access or security measure. Similarly, while a key may be used at a hotel, it would not typically be referred to as a "personal" key, as it is not solely for the use of one person. Answer is
--target-- front door
--input-- Question: The cat kept pestering it's owner, it was that time of the day and it was what? Options: A: litter tray,B: whiskers,C: hungry,D: feline,E: thirsty, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat was bothering its owner, which is a common behavior when cats are hungry.

Options: A: california,B: downtown,C: large town,D: tokio,E: china town, Knowledge: The question is asking where it is likely to find a Japanese restaurant NOT run by people from Japan. This implies that finding a Japanese restaurant run by non-Japanese people is uncommon. Options like California, Downtown, and China Town may have a higher population of Japanese people and therefore a higher likelihood of finding a restaurant run by Japanese people. Tokyo is part of Japan, so it doesn't fit the question. A large town would have a more diverse population and may have non-Japanese people running Japanese restaurants. Answer is
--target-- large town

Options: A: reproduce asexually,B: males,C: mammals,D: attack,E: ocean, Knowledge: The defining characteristic of mammals is their ability to produce milk to nourish their young, which is why they are often associated with live birth and nursing. The fact that the animals in the sentence are described as having hair and not laying eggs is a strong hint that they are indeed mammals, as these are both common traits among this group. The other options (reproduce asexually, males, attack, ocean) are not related to the context of the sentence and can be eliminated. Answer is
--target-- mammals
--input-- Question: John was an aristocratic fox hunter.  Where might he live?

The options "shop" and "bookcase" do not make sense in this context. "Shelf" could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough. "Kitchen" is too broad, as there are many places in a kitchen where food could be stored. "Refrigerators" is the correct answer, as it is a common practice to refrigerate food after it has been opened to prevent spoilage. Answer is

--input-- Question: How is riding a bike getting it to move? Options: A: practice,B: sense of balance,C: driving,D: good balance,E: pedalling, Knowledge: The act of pedalling is what propels a bike forward, so this is the most logical answer.

"Good balance" is similar to the "sense of balance" option and does not explain how a bike moves. Answer is
--target-- pedalling

--input-- Question: If I want to open a steakhouse, what should I get first? Options: A: michigan,B: florida,C: wine,D: texas,E: building, Knowledge: The question is asking about the initial step in opening a steakhouse. The answer is likely related to the physical establishment or location of the steakhouse, so options Michigan and Florida are less likely to be the correct answer. Wine is unrelated to the initial step of opening a steakhouse, so it can be eliminated as well.

Planning revenge would be an extreme and inappropriate response, and dressing nice (though important for a date) would not serve any purpose if the date does not show up. Answer is
--target-- wait for

The options "grocery store" and "supermarket" are unlikely to sell clothing, so they can be eliminated. The word "mall" is a general term for a large shopping center that may contain clothing stores, but it is not a specific store that sells clothing.

Panic is a common response to situations that cause anxiety, stress, or fear, so this choice is the most likely answer. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they neither describe a negative response to answering questions nor explain why Zane might struggle with it. Answer is
--target-- panic

In this case, the question implies that the benefit of doing so is something that the celebrity gains, rather than the public or society as a whole.

Options: A: freeway,B: road,C: race track,D: alley,E: parking lot, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is referring to a place where cars can safely travel at very high speeds. While cars can travel quickly on many different types of roads and tracks, a freeway is a type of highway designed specifically for high speed travel with limited access points and no interruptions from other vehicles or pedestrians. The other options either have slow speed limits, obstructions, or are not designed for high speed travel. Answer is
--target-- freeway
--input-- Question: What might a person be watching if they see a man with a suitcase full of money? Options: A: baggage compartment,B: movie,C: subway,D: airplane,E: cargo hold, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person is watching something, indicating that this question is likely a hypothetical scenario. The context of the sentence implies that the man with the suitcase full of money is a character in a movie, rather than a real-life situation. The other options (subway, airplane, baggage compartment, cargo hold) are real-life scenarios in which a person might encounter a man with a suitcase, but they do not fit the context of the sentence as well as "movie." Answer is
--target-- movie
--input-- Question: Eating breakfast in bed while seeing a homeless person shivering outside your window may cause you to what? Options: A: mess,B: hungry,C: feel guilty,D: indigestion,E: spills, Knowledge: The contrasting images of enjoying a luxurious breakfast in bed while seeing a homeless person shivering outside implies a sense of guilt or discomfort. The other options, such as mess, spills, or indigestion, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- feel guilty
--input-- Question: If I put in my key and open a hinged door, where am I likely entering? Options: A: kitchen,B: safe,C: own house,D: building,E: pantry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is using a key to access a door, which is commonly associated with entering one's own house. The other options do not necessarily involve using a key or opening a hinged door, and therefore are less likely to be correct answers based on the given information. Answer is
--target-- own house
--input-- Question: If somebody is working at a reception desk, they are located at the front entrance of the what? Options: A: motel,B: hostel,C: building,D: lobby,E: office park, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location referenced is a place where people are greeted or checked in upon entering.

--target-- lobby
--input-- Question: If you're reading a newspaper from another country what are you doing? Options: A: learning about world,B: education,C: get angry,D: concern,E: eat cake, Knowledge: The sentence implies that reading a newspaper from another country is a way to gain knowledge about the world. Newspapers typically report on current events and news from both local and international perspectives, which can help readers gain a broader understanding of global issues. The other options do not relate to gaining knowledge or reading a newspaper. Answer is
--target-- learning about world
--input-- Question: They wanted to recognize his accomplishment, where should they put his name? Options: A: certificate,B: directory,C: phone book,D: lineup,E: roster, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has accomplished something and that they want to recognize that accomplishment by putting the person's name somewhere. A roster is a list of names of individuals who are part of a certain group or organization, so in this context, it makes sense to put the person's name on a roster to recognize their achievement. The other options, such as a certificate or phone book, do not necessarily have a direct connection to recognition or accomplishment. Answer is
--target-- roster
--input-- Question: What is it called when a person tends to leave things to the last minute? Options: A: procrastinate,B: complete collection,C: headache,D: good time management,E: have to hold, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being described has a habit of delaying tasks until the last minute, which is a behavior commonly known as procrastination.

--input-- Question: What will you do if you do not want to settle in one place? Options: A: walk,B: agitate,C: wander,D: remove,E: disturb, Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a verb that describes the action of not wanting to settle in one place. "Walk" and "remove" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Agitate" and "disturb" imply a sense of turmoil or unrest, which is not what the sentence is asking for. "Wander" is the best fit as it implies a leisurely and aimless movement, which aligns with the idea of not wanting to stay in one place. Answer is
--target-- wander
--input-- Question: Where would a person live that isn't in the metro area but still has good schools? Options: A: woods,B: bed,C: suburbs,D: rural,E: neighborhood, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for an area with good schools that is not in the city or metro area. The suburbs are often known for having good schools while still being outside of the city. The other options, such as woods, bed, rural, and neighborhood, do not necessarily have a strong correlation with good schools. Answer is
--target-- suburbs
--input-- Question: Jane works for the government as a senator, where does she spend a lot of time? Options: A: capitol building,B: everything,C: washington d.c,D: russia,E: canada, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Jane is a senator who works for the government, and the question is asking where she spends a lot of time. The capitol building is the main headquarters for the U.S. Congress and is where senators and representatives spend a significant amount of their time working. Washington D.C. is also a plausible answer since it is the location of the capitol building, but the other options are not relevant to the sentence's context. Answer is
--target-- capitol building
--input-- Question: What is it called when two people in love have children? Options: A: take oath,B: procreate,C: matrimony,D: please parents,E: live life, Knowledge: The word "procreate" means to have children, so it is the correct answer to the question. "Take oath" refers to making a solemn promise, "matrimony" refers to marriage, "please parents" is not directly related to the question, and "live life" is too broad and does not specifically refer to having children in a romantic relationship. Answer is
--target-- procreate
--input-- Question: What did the policemen do when they heard a cry from a distance? Options: A: run away,B: hurry along,C: fine motorists,D: direct traffic,E: help, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the policemen heard a cry from a distance and their subsequent action was in response to that sound. Running away or hurrying along would not be appropriate responses to a cry for help. Fine motorists and direct traffic are options that do not match the context of the sentence, as they have nothing to do with responding to a cry from a distance. Therefore, the correct answer must be help. Answer is
--target-- help
--input-- Question: It takes ambition to complete a job, but the first step is to what? Options: A: take care of proposals,B: begin work,C: in charge of project,D: eat cake,E: go to school, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that completing a job requires ambition, but it also implies that there is a specific first step that needs to be taken before the job can be completed. The phrase "begin work" is the most logical answer because it's the only choice that directly relates to starting a job. "Take care of proposals" suggests a more administrative role, "in charge of project" suggests a leadership role, "eat cake" is unrelated and "go to school" is likely irrelevant in this context. Answer is
--target-- begin work
--input-- Question: Where would I not want a fox? Options: A: hen house,B: english hunt,C: mountains,D: outside bedroom window,E: england, Knowledge: Foxes are known for being a predator of chickens and other poultry, so it would not be desirable to have a fox in a hen house. The other options do not have a clear connection to the negative implications of having a fox present. Answer is
--target-- hen house
--input-- Question: What type of building has the most top floor? Options: A: go down,B: apartment building,C: tall building,D: office building,E: cabin, Knowledge: The question asks about the type of building that has the most top floor, which suggests that the answer has to do with a building's height. The option "tall building" directly relates to the concept of height, while the other options do not. "Go down" is a phrase that does not make sense in the context of the question. "Apartment building" and "office building" do not necessarily imply height - they can come in a range of sizes. "Cabin" usually implies a smaller, more rustic type of lodging, which again does not connect to the concept of height. Answer is
--target-- tall building
--input-- Question: What do humans do to other humans after death? Options: A: celebrate,B: burial,C: life,D: rebirth,E: decomposition, Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to humans after they have died, so celebration and life are unlikely options. Rebirth may be a belief held by some religions, but it is not a common or universal practice. Decomposition technically occurs after death, but it is not something that humans do intentionally to other humans. Burial, on the other hand, is a common and traditional practice in many cultures, and involves placing the body in a grave or tomb. Answer is
--target-- burial
--input-- Question: Where can you find a restaurant's phone number? Options: A: yellow pages,B: town,C: business sector,D: town,E: at hotel, Knowledge: The question is asking where a restaurant's phone number can be found, and the most likely option is at the hotel where the restaurant is located. Many hotels have a directory or information booklet that includes details about the various amenities and services available, including restaurants on the hotel property. The yellow pages and business sector may have listings for restaurants, but they may not always include phone numbers. The option of "town" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information on where to find the phone number. Answer is
--target-- at hotel
--input-- Question: What would you put coins into to make it work? Options: A: stove,B: water fountain,C: desk,D: purse,E: jar, Knowledge: The question is asking for an object that requires coins to function, which is commonly associated with a water fountain. Water fountains often have a slot for coins or tokens to be inserted in order to activate the water flow or other features. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- water fountain
--input-- Question: A patriotic guy with a camera is looking for a bald eagle, what is he likely to do with the eagle if he finds one? Options: A: city,B: canada,C: minnesota,D: thermal,E: photograph, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is patriotic and has a camera, which implies that they are interested in taking pictures. Additionally, they are specifically looking for a bald eagle. Given that bald eagles are a national symbol of the United States, it is likely that the person is hoping to capture an image of the bird as an expression of patriotism. Therefore, the correct answer is photograph. The other options (city, Canada, Minnesota, and thermal) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- photograph
--input-- Question: Where can you go to use a piano in your neighborhood if you don't have one? Options: A: music school,B: music store,C: neighbor's house,D: lunch,E: drawing room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking to use a piano in their neighborhood, implying that they cannot have one at home. The options "neighbor's house" and "drawing room" would not be feasible as they do not provide access to a piano. "Lunch" is an unrelated word and cannot be the answer. A music school or music store would likely have a piano available for use or rent, making them the most relevant options. Answer is
--target-- music school or music store
--input-- Question: Where would you get a shower curtain if you do not have one? Options: A: department store,B: restaurant,C: hotel,D: dime store,E: bathtub, Knowledge: Shower curtains are commonly found for purchase at department stores or dime stores (discount stores). Restaurants and hotels typically do not sell shower curtains, and bathtubs are not a location where one would obtain a shower curtain. Answer is
--target-- department store or dime store
--input-- Question: Kissing is normally an activity reserved for your romantic what? Options: A: anus,B: partner,C: arousal,D: trust,E: cooperation, Knowledge: The word "romantic" in the sentence suggests that the activity of kissing is associated with a special emotional connection between two people. The word "partner" is commonly used to refer to someone in a romantic relationship, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context - "anus" is not typically associated with kissing, "arousal" is a physical state that may or may not be present during kissing, while "trust" and "cooperation" are important in any relationship, but not necessarily specific to romantic ones. Answer is
--target-- partner
--input-- Question: What does a child learn to do before school? Options: A: count to ten,B: state name,C: dress herself,D: clean room,E: socialize, Knowledge: It is a common milestone for children to learn how to state their own name before entering school. This helps them to introduce themselves and participate in classroom activities. While learning to count and socialize are also important skills for young children, they are not typically considered prerequisites for attending school. Dressing oneself and keeping a clean room are household tasks that may be encouraged, but are not necessarily related to school preparation. Answer is
--target-- state name
--input-- Question: He was getting advice for the job interview, they told him when talking to the interviewer always make what? Options: A: get tired of,B: small talk,C: eye contact,D: friendship,E: social life, Knowledge: Eye contact is commonly advised during job interviews as it conveys confidence, credibility, and honesty. The other options are either irrelevant or counterproductive during a job interview. Small talk may be appropriate to build rapport, but it is not the main focus. Friendship and social life are personal topics that are not relevant to the job interview. Getting tired of the interviewer is certainly not an advisable approach. Answer is
--target-- eye contact
--input-- Question: According to what book did an apple tree lead to the downfall of man? Options: A: bible,B: spain,C: harry potter,D: new york,E: woods, Knowledge: This question is referencing the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where they were forbidden from eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The serpent convinced Eve to eat the fruit, and she then convinced Adam to eat it as well, leading to their expulsion from the garden and the introduction of sin and suffering into the world. The other options do not have any connection to this specific story. Answer is
--target-- bible
--input-- Question: The neighborhood had a great sense of community, there was always a crowd at the landing of the what? Options: A: stairwell,B: arena,C: ocean,D: airport,E: apartment building, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the neighborhood had a tight-knit community, which is often associated with close proximity and shared living spaces. The option "apartment building" fits this description, as it is a type of housing where residents often share common areas and interact with each other. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- apartment building
--input-- Question: What might a kind person do? Options: A: cross street,B: talk to themselves,C: open doors,D: throw away,E: study greek, Knowledge: The word "kind" suggests that the correct answer will involve a thoughtful or considerate action. Opening doors for others is a common example of this type of behavior, as it shows respect for the other person and acknowledges their needs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of kindness. Answer is
--target-- open doors
--input-- Question: What will a person do at work? Options: A: cross street,B: draw attention to themselves,C: make money,D: falling down,E: come home, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to what a person will do for a living. Making money is a common purpose of going to work. The other options, such as "cross street" or "falling down," do not make sense in the context of work. "Draw attention to themselves" could be a possible answer, but it is less likely because it is not always the main purpose of work. "Come home" is also not a correct answer because it describes the end of the workday, rather than what a person does during work. Answer is
--target-- make money
--input-- Question: John saw a fox running along the beach and was glad to be on the east coast.  Where might he have been? Options: A: tennessee,B: south carolina,C: louisiana,D: oklahoma,E: mountains, Knowledge: The clue in the sentence is that John was glad to be on the east coast. The options given are all US states or regions, and only South Carolina is on the east coast. The other options are either inland or in the west, so they do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- south carolina
--input-- Question: Name a location where you would not want to find mice. Options: A: loft,B: attic,C: bell cat,D: countryside,E: laboratory, Knowledge: Laboratories are typically used for scientific and medical purposes where cleanliness and hygiene are crucial. Mice present a risk of contamination and can affect the accuracy of experiments, making it an undesirable place to find them. The other options, such as loft and attic, are commonly known locations where mice may be found but do not have the same association with cleanliness and precision as a laboratory. Answer is
--target-- laboratory
--input-- Question: The man started to learn jogging, what was he hoping to do? Options: A: exhaustion,B: getting in shape,C: fitness,D: injure himself,E: fatigue, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is trying to improve his physical condition through the activity of jogging. "Getting in shape" is a common expression used to describe the process of becoming more physically fit, which is likely the goal that the man had in mind when he started to learn how to jog. The other options all suggest negative outcomes or side effects of jogging, which would not be desired by someone who is trying to improve their health. Answer is
--target-- getting in shape
--input-- Question: Where do most people turn to get information on their phones? Options: A: internet,B: book,C: online,D: google,E: manual, Knowledge: The sentence implies that people are seeking information on their phones, which suggests that they are likely using a form of technology to access that information. The options "book" and "manual" are unlikely, as people are not likely to consult physical books or manuals for information on their phones. "Google" is a search engine that can be used on the internet, so it is a potential answer. "Online" is a bit redundant, as the internet is an online platform, but it is still a potential answer. Therefore, "internet" is the most likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- internet
--input-- Question: What happens to a body after death? Options: A: rebirth,B: human experience,C: sadness,D: decomposition,E: obesity, Knowledge: Decomposition is the process by which a body breaks down and returns to its basic elements after death.

Options: A: beef stew,B: own kitchen,C: clam chowder,D: kitchen cabinet,E: pantry, Knowledge: Clam chowder is a type of soup that typically includes potatoes as one of the main ingredients. Beef stew might include potatoes as well, but the word "soup" indicates that the correct answer is a liquid dish. "Own kitchen," "kitchen cabinet," and "pantry" are not types of soup and have no relevance to the question. Answer is
--target-- clam chowder
--input-- Question: Though she had a disability, what did her encouraging and positive coach see in her? Options: A: qualification,B: strength,C: pity,D: competence,E: potential, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the coach saw something in the person that allowed them to believe that they could achieve success in spite of their disability. The word "encouraging" implies that the coach was optimistic and supportive, and the phrase "positive coach" suggests that the coach had a positive outlook on the person's abilities. The other options, such as "pity," do not fit the context of the sentence as they imply a negative view of the person's disability. Answer is
--target-- potential
--input-- Question: They had a theory of what they could do in t he big game, so over and over they would what? Options: A: park,B: practice,C: fact,D: practical,E: practise, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject had a theory about what they could do in the big game and, therefore, likely repeated the activity or strategy repeatedly to improve their chances of success. The correct spelling is "practice" with a "c" when used as a noun, and "practise" with an "s" when used as a verb in some British English contexts. The other options, such as "park," "fact," and "practical," do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- practice
--input-- Question: When you see something rise, you are where in relation to it? Options: A: sun set,B: near,C: fall,D: below,E: lower, Knowledge: The word "rise" implies that the object is moving upwards, which means that it is getting higher.

--target-- below
--input-- Question: They were getting ready for a really long hike, he put the food can in his what? Options: A: cabinet,B: house,C: recycling center,D: backpack,E: make person sick, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is preparing for a long hike and needs to bring food with them. Putting the food can in a cabinet or house wouldn't make sense, and putting it in a recycling center is not relevant to the context of the sentence. The last option, "make person sick," is not a logical place to put a food can. Therefore, the only logical option that fits with preparing for a hike would be putting the food can in a backpack. Answer is
--target-- backpack
--input-- Question: Where would you keep a rug near your front door? Options: A: persia,B: desk,C: table,D: living room,E: hall, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the rug is being used as a doormat, which would be placed in the hall near the front door. The other options do not correspond to the function or location of a doormat. Persia is a region known for producing rugs, but it is not a location where one would keep a rug near a front door. A desk or table would not be appropriate locations for a doormat, and the living room is not typically where one would place a doormat. Answer is
--target-- hall

--target-- fall down
--input-- Question: What do you do when you need to get food? Options: A: table,B: disneyland,C: refrigerators,D: pantry,E: shop, Knowledge: The word "shop" is commonly associated with buying things, including food. The other choices are not relevant to getting food in the context of the question. The word "table" refers to a piece of furniture used for eating, while "Disneyland" is a theme park and has no connection to getting food. "Refrigerators" and "pantry" are places where food is stored, but they do not necessarily indicate a means of obtaining food. Answer is
--target-- shop
--input-- Question: Brad tried to arise from bed but he could not.  Instead, he just continued to do what? Options: A: go down,B: fall down,C: lie down,D: lie to himself,E: sit down, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Brad was unable to get out of bed, so instead he continued to do something that he was already doing, which is lying down. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence; if Brad was trying to get out of bed, he would not go down or sit down, and falling down implies a loss of balance or control that is not indicated in the sentence. Lying to himself may be possible, but it is not suggested in this particular sentence. Answer is
--target-- lie down
--input-- Question: If a heifer is really high quality, you might take her where? Options: A: home,B: dairy farm,C: cattle show,D: dairy barn,E: corral, Knowledge: The word "heifer" refers to a young female cow that has not yet had a calf. In the context of the question, it suggests that the heifer in question is of high quality, meaning she has desirable traits, such as good genetics or a healthy body. Taking a heifer to a cattle show would be the logical option in this case, as these events are often used to showcase and compare the best animals in a given breed or category. The other options, such as taking her home or to a dairy farm, do not necessarily imply that the heifer is particularly high quality or show-worthy. Answer is
--target-- cattle show

Options: A: home,B: wealth,C: bankruptcy,D: lose money,E: get rich, Knowledge: Opening a business is typically seen as a means to generate income and accumulate wealth.

None of the other options reflect the intended purpose of opening a business, which is to generate revenue and potentially become financially successful.

--target-- get rich
--input-- Question: What has someone who had finished their undergraduate done?

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- train station

Options: A: pleasure,B: greater mobility,C: desire to travel,D: global warming,E: increased security, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that poor college students gain something by learning about the world.

--input-- Question: John wanted to clean all of the dust out of his place before settling down to watch his favorite shows.  What might he hardest do dust? Options: A: closet,B: under the bed,C: television,D: attic,E: most buildings, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John wants to clean all the dust out of his place before watching TV, implying that the TV is not the hardest place to dust. The closet, attic, and most buildings are too general to be considered specific places to dust. However, the phrase "settling down" implies that John wants to be comfortable while watching his favorite shows, so it is likely that he will focus on cleaning the area close to his seating arrangement, which could include the space under the bed. Therefore, it is most likely that the hardest place John will have to dust is under the bed. Answer is
--target-- under the bed
--input-- Question: Something had the nerve to break into the garbage last night, what did it? Options: A: eyes,B: animal,C: fingertips,D: brainstem,E: human body, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something broke into the garbage, which indicates an act of animal behavior rather than human behavior. The other options (eyes, fingertips, brainstem, and human body) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. It is also common for animals to scavenge through garbage for food, so it further supports the answer choice of "animal." Answer is

Options: A: profane,B: halibut,C: damaged,D: common,E: halibut, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tour guide is explaining why everyone is crying at the holy site. The word "common" implies that this is not an unusual occurrence and happens frequently. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

Options: A: housing estate,B: neighborhood,C: mars,D: woods,E: suburbs, Knowledge: The word "neighbor" typically refers to someone who lives near or next to you. Therefore, if a person wants no neighbors, they would choose to live in an area where there are no other houses or apartments nearby. The only option that fits this criterion is "woods," which suggests a location in a forest or wooded area, far away from other housing developments. The other options all involve living near other people or in built-up areas. Answer is
--target-- woods

Options: A: get lost,B: require water,C: trained,D: bark,E: roll over, Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone puts up posters of a lost dog, indicating that the dog has gone missing. This suggests that the correct answer is "get lost."

Options: A: texas,B: building,C: kansas city,D: maine,E: falling down, Knowledge: The question asks for the location of the most famous BBQ steakhouses in America. Texas and Kansas City are both well-known for their barbecue, with many famous BBQ steakhouses located in those areas.

Options: A: boredom,B: malaria,C: graduate,D: inspiration,E: detention, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individual is attending school and falling asleep, which implies that they are not engaged in the lesson and find it dull or uninteresting. Boredom is a common reason for students to feel sleepy during class. Malaria is a tropical disease caused by parasites, and it is unlikely for someone to have malaria while attending school. Graduate is a term used to describe successfully completing a degree program, which does not relate to the context of the sentence. Inspiration refers to a feeling of being inspired or motivated, which does not fit the context of the sentence. Detention is a form of punishment, which is not relevant to someone being sleepy during class. Answer is
--target-- boredom

Options: A: orchestra,B: church,C: chinese temple,D: chinatown,E: music store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a gong, which is a musical instrument. The options "orchestra," "church," and "Chinese temple" may have gongs, but it is unlikely that they would sell them. "Chinatown" may have stores that sell gongs, but it is not a reliable option. "Music store" is the best option because they specialize in selling musical instruments, and it is likely that they carry gongs. Answer is
--target-- music store
--input-- Question: What would friends do if they need each others' help? Options: A: call each other,B: group together,C: understand each other,D: meet for lunch,E: part company, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that friends in need of help would do something specific as a result. The option "call each other" is the most likely choice, as it implies communication and a willingness to reach out for assistance.

--target-- call each other

Options: A: believe in god,B: dance,C: desire to win,D: destroy each other,E: run amok, Knowledge: The sentence implies that people are engaged in a game, and when people participate in games, their primary motivation is the desire to win. This is because games often involve competition and the desire to prove oneself or outperform others. The other options listed do not align with the context of the sentence or have any relation to the nature of playing games. Answer is
--target-- desire to win

Answer is
--target-- standing in line

--input-- Question: The old man needed to have rest multiple times a day, he would do what on the couch and catnap? Options: A: lay in bed,B: lay in bed,C: go to bed,D: relax,E: lie down, Knowledge: The phrase "catnap" suggests that the old man is taking short naps during the day, most likely on a couch. The other options suggest going to bed, which would not be feasible for multiple naps during the day, or simply relaxing without the implication of sleeping. "Lie down" is the most appropriate option for the given context. Answer is
--target-- lie down
--input-- Question: The end of the barrel of what primitive firearm is bell shaped? Options: A: barbell,B: funnel,C: blunderbuss,D: wind instrument,E: kettlebell, Knowledge: A blunderbuss is a type of primitive firearm that was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Options: A: library,B: health department,C: mail box,D: drawer,E: bookstore, Knowledge: The question is asking about a good place to store pamphlets, which are usually small, flat documents. A drawer would provide a secure and organized place to keep the pamphlets, without taking up too much space. The other options (library, health department, bookstore) are public spaces and may not be convenient for storing personal pamphlets. The mailbox is inappropriate for storing anything other than mail. Answer is
--target-- drawer
--input-- Question: Many humans enjoy fishing and enjoy another relaxing activity at the same time, what activity is it? Options: A: getting tied up lure.,B: looking for information,C: get wet,D: drink beer,E: sit quietly, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that fishing is a relaxing activity, and that many people enjoy another relaxing activity while fishing. Getting tied up lure and looking for information are not commonly associated with fishing as a leisure activity. Getting wet is also not necessarily enjoyable for everyone and may not be a typical part of fishing. Drinking beer may be a common activity while fishing but is not necessarily relaxing for everyone. Sitting quietly is often associated with fishing as a way to enjoy nature and the peacefulness of being on a body of water. Answer is
--target-- sit quietly

Options: A: bookstore,B: library,C: electrical circuit,D: cabinet,E: important when traveling, Knowledge: The question is asking about where to obtain maps that you own, suggesting that you want to purchase or borrow them for personal use. The options "electrical circuit" and "cabinet" have no relevance to obtaining maps. The option "important when traveling" is a phrase rather than a location and does not offer a clear choice. Both bookstores and libraries are common places to find maps for personal use, so either of these options could be correct. Answer is
--target-- bookstore or library
--input-- Question: Where is a good place to put a hamburger? Options: A: resturant,B: fast food restaurant,C: mouth,D: kitchen,E: pizza, Knowledge: When it comes to food, the mouth is the most logical answer for where to put a hamburger.

Options: A: car shop,B: desk drawer,C: car.,D: warehouse,E: hand, Knowledge: The question is asking for a place to store a steel pen in an office setting, which suggests a location indoors. The options "car shop," "car," and "warehouse" are all locations outside of an office and therefore unlikely options. The option "hand" doesn't make sense as a place to store a pen. A desk drawer is a common and convenient location for storing office supplies, including pens. Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: A story about World War II would be set when? Options: A: book or library,B: book or magazine,C: newspaper,D: past,E: future, Knowledge: World War II took place from 1939-1945, which is in the past. Therefore, a story about this event would be set in the past, not the future or present. The other answer choices, such as book or library, book or magazine, and newspaper, are irrelevant to the question as they do not indicate a specific time period. Answer is
--target-- past
--input-- Question: What type of geographic area will you find a marmot? Options: A: mountainous area,B: wood pile,C: jungle,D: petting zoo,E: animals, Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous areas, especially in rocky and alpine habitats. They are adapted to high altitudes and cooler temperatures, which is why they prefer mountainous environments. The other options, such as wood piles, jungle, petting zoos, and animals, do not provide a suitable habitat for marmots. Answer is
--target-- mountainous area
--input-- Question: Most people make stupid assumptions that are based on their prejudices.  What might they do instead to achieve better outcomes? Options: A: set table,B: think,C: read books,D: play games,E: lie, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people make assumptions that are not based on logic or reason, but rather on their biases or preconceived notions. To achieve better outcomes, they should engage in critical thinking and analyze situations objectively before making any assumptions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - setting a table or playing games, for example, would not have any impact on a person's ability to make informed assumptions. Lying is also not a suitable option, as it would only exacerbate the problem. Reading books, on the other hand, could be helpful in expanding a person's knowledge and challenging their assumptions. Answer is
--target-- think
--input-- Question: What is something children can do while traveling in a car? Options: A: listen to music,B: watch television,C: play chess,D: walk,E: play basketball, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking for an activity that can be done while traveling in a car, which usually involves sitting down and being in a confined space. Walking and playing basketball require space and movement that is not possible in a car. Playing chess requires a board and pieces, which may not be practical to bring on a car trip. Watching television may not be available in every car and can also cause motion sickness for some people. However, listening to music can easily be done with headphones or through the car's sound system and does not require much physical movement. Answer is
--target-- listen to music
--input-- Question: Where would you hear a trumpet along with other instruments made from the same material? Options: A: music store,B: bass,C: brass band,D: orchestra,E: marching band, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a trumpet and other instruments made from the same material would be heard. The material is specified as brass, which narrows down the options to brass instruments. A brass band is a type of musical ensemble that consists of brass instruments, including trumpets, as well as percussion. The other options do not specifically refer to brass instruments or ensembles. Answer is
--target-- brass band
--input-- Question: The audience listened to the orchestra play, where were they watching the performance? Options: A: concert hall,B: museum,C: school,D: hockey game,E: sporting event, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the audience was listening to an orchestra play, which strongly suggests that they were attending a musical performance. Of the choices provided, only "concert hall" fits this description. "Museum" and "school" are unlikely venues for a musical performance, while "hockey game" and "sporting event" are completely unrelated to the context given. Answer is
--target-- concert hall
--input-- Question: Stabbing to death of a person is what sort of way to die? Options: A: pool of blood,B: gruesome,C: charming,D: being arrested,E: killing, Knowledge: The use of the phrase "stabbing to death" indicates that the death was violent and likely gruesome. The other options do not fit the context of a violent death. "Pool of blood" and "killing" are related to the act of violence, but do not describe the manner of dying itself. "Being arrested" and "charming" have no relevance to the sentence. Answer is
--target-- gruesome
--input-- Question: What are you getting from you boss at the end of the week? Options: A: asking for,B: money,C: food,D: work,E: energy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is expecting to receive something from their boss at the end of the week. The term "getting" often implies receiving something in return, which rules out options like asking for or work. The option food is also unlikely since it is uncommon for employers to provide food as a form of compensation. Energy may be a plausible choice depending on the context, but the speaker's use of the term "you boss" implies a professional relationship, suggesting that money is the most probable answer. Answer is
--target-- money
--input-- Question: If you have a ticket and you are planning to eat hot dogs, where would you go? Options: A: lottery,B: person's hand,C: baseball stadium,D: movie,E: kitchen, Knowledge: Hot dogs are a popular food item sold at baseball stadiums along with other traditional ballpark fare like peanuts and cracker jacks.

--target-- baseball stadium
--input-- Question: Where is a great place to buy fresh fruit? Options: A: san francisco,B: refrigerator,C: big box retailer,D: tree,E: market, Knowledge: The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of the question. San Francisco is a location, not a place to buy fresh fruit. A refrigerator is a household appliance and not a place to purchase fruits. A big box retailer may sell fruits, but they may not necessarily be fresh. A tree is a natural source of fruit, but it does not specify where to find it. On the other hand, a market is a common place where fresh fruits are sold. Answer is
--target-- market
--input-- Question: The man took paperwork to other people to consult over it, where was he heading? Options: A: desk,B: meeting,C: office,D: table,E: work, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man is taking paperwork to other people to consult with them, which suggests that he is heading to a place where he can meet with others to discuss the paperwork. A meeting is a common setting for collaboration and discussion in many workplaces, whereas the other options (desk, office, table, work) do not necessarily imply that other people will be involved in the consultation process. Answer is
--target-- meeting
--input-- Question: Stark was just having fun, and he wasn't hurting anyone.  What might have he been doing? Options: A: painting his nails,B: playing marbles,C: constructing,D: need for rest,E: wild ride, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that whatever Stark was doing, it was harmless and enjoyable. Playing marbles is a common pastime that fits this description, whereas painting nails, constructing, and wild rides could potentially be more dangerous or require more effort. Needing rest is also not a likely activity to be described as "having fun." Therefore, playing marbles is the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- playing marbles
--input-- Question: The church was giving assistance, what were they hoping to accomplish? Options: A: exhilliration,B: hardship,C: risk taking,D: helping others,E: happiness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the church is providing some kind of aid or support, which implies that they are hoping to help someone or some group of people. "Helping others" is the only option that directly relates to this context, as the other options do not reflect a clear purpose for the church's actions. "Exhilaration" and "happiness" are both positive emotions, but they do not necessarily indicate a specific goal or motivation for the church's assistance. "Hardship" and "risk taking" are both negative, and do not make sense in the context of an organization providing aid. Answer is
--target-- helping others
--input-- Question: I you believe in god, where will you go when you die? Options: A: heaven,B: church,C: imagination,D: synagogue,E: monastery, Knowledge: The question is asking about the afterlife and assumes the belief in a higher power, specifically asking about the location one would go after death. Heaven is a common concept in many religions and is often associated with the afterlife for those who have lived a virtuous life. The other options do not pertain to the specific concept of an afterlife or the belief in a higher power. Answer is
--target-- heaven
--input-- Question: What can eating hamburger cause immediately after eating it? Options: A: tasty,B: health problems,C: eat cake,D: indigestion,E: gain weight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating a hamburger can have negative consequences immediately after consumption. Indigestion is a common after-effect of eating heavy, high-fat meals like hamburgers. 'Tasty' might be a potential choice for a positive effect of eating a hamburger, but the sentence specifically asks for an immediate consequence, and 'tasty' does not fit this criterion. 'Health problems' and 'gain weight' are possible longer-term consequences of regularly consuming fast food like hamburgers, but they don't fit the immediate timeframe requested in the question. 'Eat cake' is not even a consequence, but an alternative suggestion that is not related to the question. Answer is
--target-- indigestion
--input-- Question: Where is a shelf likely to be hidden behind a door? Options: A: refrigerator,B: bookstore,C: cupboard,D: school building,E: wardrobe, Knowledge: A cupboard is a piece of furniture that is often used to store items such as dishes, food, and other household items. It is common for cupboards to have doors that hide the contents inside, including any shelves that may be present. The other options, such as a refrigerator, bookstore, school building, or wardrobe, are unlikely to have a shelf hidden behind a door as they serve different purposes and do not typically have a layout that would accommodate such a feature. Answer is
--target-- cupboard
--input-- Question: The man got a pail to catch the draining motor oil, where was he likely doing this at home? Options: A: garage,B: hardware store,C: utility room,D: wishing well,E: laundry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was catching motor oil that was draining from something, and getting a pail to do so implies that this is something he has done before. Since motor oil is typically associated with cars, it is likely that the man was in his garage, where he would keep his car and car-related tools and supplies. The other options (hardware store, utility room, wishing well, laundry) do not fit with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- garage
--input-- Question: What kind of cold storage could you find in your house? Options: A: ice pack,B: freezer,C: laboratory,D: warehouse,E: refrigerator, Knowledge: The question is asking about cold storage that could be found in a typical household, which rules out options like laboratory and warehouse. Ice packs are typically used for temporary cooling, and are not a long-term storage solution. That leaves freezer and refrigerator as the two most likely options. However, the word "kind" suggests that the question is asking for a more specific type of cold storage, and refrigerators are typically designed for storing food and beverages at a cool but not frozen temperature, while freezers are designed for long-term storage of frozen food. Therefore, the best answer is refrigerator. Answer is
--target-- refrigerator
--input-- Question: Where could you go to between 1000 and 10000 restaurant? Options: A: big city,B: town,C: small town,D: canada,E: yellow pages, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a high number of restaurants can be found, specifically between 1000 and 10000. It is unlikely that a small town or a town would have that many restaurants, and Canada is too large of an area to provide a specific location. Yellow pages is a directory and not a location. Big cities, on the other hand, are known for having a large number of restaurants due to their high population density and diverse cultures. Therefore, the correct answer is big city. Answer is
--target-- big city
--input-- Question: The pitcher stepped on the mound ready to throw, where was he located specifically? Options: A: hell,B: baseball stadium,C: golf course,D: africa,E: baseball diamond, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a pitcher stepping on a mound, which indicates that the context is related to the sport of baseball. A pitcher typically stands on a raised area known as a "mound" in the middle of a baseball diamond or field. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- baseball diamond
--input-- Question: Where is a statute found on a platform? Options: A: below,B: arena,C: concert hall,D: museum,E: building, Knowledge: A statue is often found on a platform in a building, such as a pedestal or base. It is less likely to be found in an arena or concert hall where the space is more open and there may not be a dedicated platform for a statue. Museums may have statues on display, but they may also be displayed on a pedestal or platform. Therefore, the most likely answer is "building." Answer is
--target-- building
--input-- Question: If it's not used for hair a round brush is an example of what? Options: A: hair brush,B: ladies bathroom,C: art supplies,D: shower,E: hair salon, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a round brush has a use other than for hair. Art supplies is a logical option as round brushes are commonly used for painting and other artistic mediums. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence as they all relate to hair and grooming. Answer is
--target-- art supplies
--input-- Question: His parents thought he was suffering from boredom, but the teen loved to lay in bed and just do what? Options: A: meet interesting people,B: lift weights,C: listen to music,D: play chess,E: entertain, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen is spending a lot of time in bed, which is typically associated with relaxing activities like listening to music. Additionally, the fact that the teen's parents think he is bored implies that he is not doing anything highly stimulating or active, making choices like lifting weights or playing chess less likely. The option to "meet interesting people" also doesn't make sense in this context as the teen is described as staying in bed, which is a private setting. Answer is
--target-- listen to music
--input-- Question: At the picnic she was stuck eating hamburger, she was worried because she forgot her chewables to prevent what? Options: A: eat cake,B: have fun,C: food poisoning,D: heartburn,E: gain weight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person at the picnic was worried because they forgot their "chewables" which could prevent a negative health outcome. Given the context of the sentence and the choices available, the most likely negative health outcome is heartburn which can be caused by eating hamburger (a greasy meat) without taking antacids or other medications to prevent acid reflux. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- heartburn
--input-- Question: The electrode wouldn't spark, it turned out that the what hadn't been connected? Options: A: battery,B: electronic equipment,C: electrolytic cell,D: charge,E: tube, Knowledge: Electrodes require a source of energy to function properly, which is typically provided by a battery.

The other options may be components involved in electrical circuits, but they are not directly related to the functioning of an electrode. Answer is
--target-- battery
--input-- Question: For what entity should the government work? Options: A: country,B: democracy,C: canada,D: civilization,E: tax office, Knowledge: The term "government" refers to the governing body of a country, and their primary duty is to work for the benefit of that country and its citizens. Democracy is a type of government, not the entity that the government should work for. Canada is a country, not the entity that the government should work for. Civilization is a broad term that can encompass many different nations and societies, and tax office is a specific department within a government, not the entity that the government should work for. Answer is
--target-- country
--input-- Question: What must a student in engineering do? Options: A: answer question,B: learn language,C: do mathematics,D: be able to count,E: begin to study, Knowledge: Engineering is a field that heavily relies on mathematical concepts, calculations, and problem-solving. A student in engineering must have a solid foundation in mathematics to be able to design, analyze, and optimize various systems and structures. The other options are not specific to engineering, and although a student in engineering may need to answer questions, learn a language, begin studying, or be able to count, these are not specific requirements for success in the field. Answer is
--target-- do mathematics
--input-- Question: The teacher knew her students understood division, what was she hoping they would learn next? Options: A: multiplication,B: multiply,C: putting together,D: unity,E: pay debts, Knowledge: Division and multiplication are closely related mathematical concepts, with division being the inverse operation of multiplication. If the teacher knows that her students understand division, it makes sense that she would want to move on to teaching them multiplication as the next logical step in their mathematical education. The other options, such as "putting together" and "unity," do not have any clear connection to division or multiplication. Answer is
--target-- multiplication
--input-- Question: There were times where kids wanted to know a definition, so there was a nice big dictionary in the what? Options: A: pocket,B: classroom,C: table,D: library,E: shelf, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dictionary was available for kids to use when they needed to know a definition. The most logical place for a dictionary to be in a school setting would be in the classroom where students can easily access it when needed. The other options, such as pocket or shelf, are not typically associated with dictionaries being readily available in a school setting. Answer is
--target-- classroom
--input-- Question: Riding a bike for a long time can cause what? Options: A: enjoyment,B: fatigue,C: falling down,D: getting lost,E: thirst, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that long bike rides can have negative consequences, and "fatigue" is a common side effect of physical exertion. "Enjoyment" is unlikely to be the answer since the sentence is talking about negative effects, while "falling down" and "getting lost" are unrelated to the physical strain of biking. "Thirst" is possible but less likely since it is a common experience during any physical activity, not just biking specifically. Answer is
--target-- fatigue
--input-- Question: What could happen to a cat other than wanting food? Options: A: feline,B: thirsty,C: sharp claws,D: pussycat,E: hungry, Knowledge: The question asks for something that could happen to a cat other than wanting food, so it is important to eliminate the option "hungry" since it is related to food. The word "feline" refers to a cat, so it is not a plausible answer. "Sharp claws" is a characteristic of cats, but it does not relate to the question at hand. "Pussycat" is another word for cat, so it is not a viable option either. Therefore, the correct answer is "thirsty," as cats also require water to drink. Answer is

--input-- Question: If you turn off the music in a room with no other noise that room would be what? Options: A: silent,B: opera,C: silence,D: television,E: elevator, Knowledge: The question is asking what the room would be without any other noise besides the music being turned off. The word "silent" is the best fit as it means "free from sound or noise" and accurately describes a room where no other noise is present. "Opera," "television," and "elevator" are not related to the context of the question, and "silence" is a repetition of the word "silent" without adding any clarity or new information. Answer is

--input-- Question: In what country are the most fast food restaurants? Options: A: new york,B: blocks of flats,C: center of town,D: america,E: big cities, Knowledge: The question is asking about the country with the most fast food restaurants, so options like "new york," "blocks of flats," and "center of town" are not relevant as they do not refer to a country. "Big cities" could be a possibility, but it is too general and could refer to many countries. Therefore, the best answer is "America" since it is a country and is well-known for its fast food industry. Answer is
--target-- America

Options: A: tie around,B: wind around,C: weave,D: stringbed,E: ball up, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to use string to prevent something from moving, which implies that the string needs to be secured in place.

--target-- public building
--input-- Question: A potato is kept in the cellar, where is likely to be stored? Options: A: farmer's market,B: grocery bag,C: pantry,D: bushel basket,E: fridge, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the potato is currently stored in a cellar. A cellar is typically a cool, dark, and dry space that can be used for food storage. The other options, such as a farmer's market, grocery bag, pantry, and fridge, are not likely places for a potato to be stored long-term. A bushel basket may be used for storing potatoes, but it is not as specific as the given context of a cellar. Answer is
--target-- cellar

--target-- build trust
--input-- Question: Where can you store you spare linens near your socks? Options: A: hospital,B: chest,C: home,D: dresser drawers,E: cabinet, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spare linens are typically stored in the same place as socks, which indicates that it is a location commonly used for clothing storage. The options "hospital" and "cabinet" are not typically associated with personal clothing storage, and the option "home" is too broad and vague to be a useful answer. "Chest" could be a possible answer, but "dresser drawers" is a more specific and common location for storing clothing items like linens and socks. Answer is
--target-- dresser drawers
--input-- Question: What do people do when they think too quickly? Options: A: jump to conclusions,B: hurry home,C: build trust,D: pay bills,E: sing, Knowledge: The phrase "think too quickly" suggests that people may be making quick judgments or assumptions without fully considering all the facts, which is commonly referred to as "jumping to conclusions."

--target-- jump to conclusions
--input-- Question: What is someone likely to want as a result of sex? Options: A: sexploiter,B: chicken,C: reproductive cycle,D: procreation,E: human experience, Knowledge: While there are various reasons why someone may engage in sexual activity, "human experience" seems like the most appropriate choice based on the context of the question. Sexploiter and chicken are not related to the topic of sex, while reproductive cycle and procreation are too specific and may not encompass all the reasons people have sex. "Human experience" is a broad term that can capture the emotional, physical, and psychological aspects associated with sexual activity. Answer is
--target-- human experience
--input-- Question: What might someone do after they finish creating art? Options: A: frustration,B: relax,C: eat,D: enlightenment,E: communication, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity of creating art can be a mentally and physically exhausting process. Therefore, it makes sense that someone would want to relax once they've finished their work. "Frustration" does not fit the context because it suggests that the person had a difficult time creating the art. "Eat" and "communication" do not follow from the context provided. "Enlightenment" could be a possible answer if the context suggested that the art had some spiritual or philosophical significance. Answer is
--target-- relax
--input-- Question: To get clean clothes you to what to them? Options: A: get dirty,B: writing,C: use water,D: launder,E: soap, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about how to get clean clothes, which implies that the clothes are currently dirty. The options "get dirty" and "writing" have no relevance to cleaning clothes. "Use water" is necessary for cleaning clothes, but not sufficient on its own. The options "launder" and "soap" are both methods commonly used for cleaning clothes, but "launder" specifically refers to the process of washing and cleaning clothes. Answer is
--target-- launder
--input-- Question: The person tried to reduce his weight with a shrink ray, but he got it backwards and only did what? Options: A: grow,B: gain weight,C: make larger,D: augment,E: get bigger, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was trying to reduce their weight but made a mistake with a shrink ray. This means that the shrink ray did the opposite of what was intended, causing the person to become larger rather than smaller. Therefore, the correct answer is "grow." The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- grow

Options: A: old person,B: begin to talk,C: adult,D: old man,E: girl, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Christine is too old to be having a baby, which implies that she is an adult.

Answer is
--target-- adult
--input-- Question: Joe plays a percussion instrument in something.  What might be play in? Options: A: own home,B: music store,C: marching band,D: orchestra,E: party, Knowledge: The word "percussion" is commonly associated with marching bands and orchestras, which frequently use drums and other percussion instruments as part of their musical arrangements. Music stores and own homes may have percussion instruments available, but the focus on playing in "something" suggests a larger, organized group such as a band or orchestra. Parties may also feature live music, but it is less likely that a percussion instrument would be the featured instrument at a party. Answer is
--target-- marching band
--input-- Question: If I'm playing ball, I'm mostly trying to do what? Options: A: losing,B: competition,C: having fun,D: win,E: injury, Knowledge: The context of playing ball suggests that the activity is being done for leisure or entertainment.

Losing and injury do not align with the idea of having fun, and are unlikely to be the intended answer. Answer is
--target-- having fun
--input-- Question: What do the terms need to be in order to compete against someone? Options: A: cheat,B: fair,C: in competition,D: practice,E: sabotage, Knowledge: When someone is competing against another person, it is important that both parties are on a level playing field.

Practice and in competition are both related to the act of competing, but do not necessarily address the need for fairness in the competition. Answer is
--target-- fair
--input-- Question: If you wanted to show off silk, what item could it be on? Options: A: jean,B: mulberry tree,C: garments,D: expensive clothing,E: parachutes, Knowledge: Silk is a luxurious fabric, often used in expensive clothing and garments. It is valued for its smooth texture and lustrous sheen, making it a popular choice for formal wear such as dresses, suits, and blouses. Jean and parachutes are made from different materials, and mulberry trees are the source of silk production but not items that display it directly in a noticeable way. Expensive clothing is a broad category that can include different types of items, but garments specifically refer to pieces of clothing that cover the body. Answer is
--target-- garments
--input-- Question: Where is known to be a wealth of information?

A library is a place where one can access a vast amount of information and resources in the form of books, journals, and other materials. The other options do not offer the same level of access to information as a library. A park is a recreational area; a meeting is a gathering of people; the internet is a vast network of data and communication, but it is not curated in the same way as a library; a book is a single source of information, not a large collection. Answer is
--target-- library

Options: A: file cabinet,B: nightstand,C: kitchen cabinet,D: office desk,E: the floor, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker did not want their resume to be carelessly tossed into a drawer. The most logical place for a resume to go in an office setting would be on the office desk, where the receptionist could easily file it or pass it along to the appropriate person. The other options (file cabinet, nightstand, kitchen cabinet, the floor) do not make sense in the context of a job application. Answer is
--target-- office desk
--input-- Question: What will happen if you inject water into yourself? Options: A: dilute,B: thin blood,C: take several forms,D: wet clothes,E: move mountains, Knowledge: Injecting water into oneself would likely dilute the blood, and potentially cause dangerous electrolyte imbalances.

The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- dilute
--input-- Question: Athletes soak in hot tubs to relieve what after playing baseball? Options: A: fame,B: errors,C: pain,D: strikes,E: sore muscles, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the athletes are playing baseball, a physically demanding sport that can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness.

--target-- sore muscles
--input-- Question: What does a gambler do that causes him or her to be unhappy? Options: A: play cards,B: double winnings,C: lose money,D: play poker,E: to win the prize, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the gambler is unhappy, which could be due to experiencing a negative outcome. One option stands out as a negative outcome, which is losing money. Playing cards, poker, and doubling winnings are activities that could result in either winning or losing, so they do not necessarily explain the gambler's unhappiness. Similarly, winning the prize would typically result in happiness, so this option is also unlikely to be correct. Answer is
--target-- lose money
--input-- Question: There's one obvious reason to eat vegetables, they're plain what you? Options: A: lose weight,B: good for,C: bland,D: chewing,E: fibre, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a positive reason for eating vegetables, and the phrase "plain what you" implies that the reason is something that is widely recognized. Most people know that vegetables are good for you, as they are high in essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the health benefits of vegetables. Answer is
--target-- good for

Options: A: earth warming,B: sun tan,C: light,D: life on earth,E: heat, Knowledge: The sun is the primary source of energy and light for our planet, which is necessary for all life on earth to exist. While it does provide warmth and heat, these are not the ultimate responsibility of the sun. A sun tan is a result of exposure to the sun's rays, but it is not a fundamental role of the sun. Light is also a result of the sun's energy, but again, it is not the ultimate responsibility of the sun. Answer is
--target-- life on earth
--input-- Question: Mandy lived in a train station.  She longed to see distant places. Where might she imagine going? Options: A: downtown area,B: centre of town,C: bedroom,D: europe,E: big city, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Mandy has a desire to see distant places, which suggests that the correct answer may be a location that is far from her current location. The options "downtown area" and "centre of town" do not necessarily indicate a far distance. The option "bedroom" is also incorrect as it is not a location that Mandy can travel to. The options "Europe" and "big city" both suggest a far distance, but "Europe" is more specific and aligns better with the idea of distant places. Answer is
--target-- Europe
--input-- Question: Joe is a  squirrel, which is an animal. He probably lives in what sort of place. Options: A: pet store,B: outside,C: woodland,D: ocean,E: cafe, Knowledge: Squirrels are typically found living in woodland areas, as they are arboreal animals that require trees to climb and nest in. The other options do not make sense because Joe is a wild animal that would not be found in a pet store or cafe, and would not survive in the ocean. Though squirrels can sometimes be found in urban areas or parks, "outside" is too vague to be a correct answer. Answer is
--target-- woodland
--input-- Question: Where could a personal ficus live? Options: A: cabin in the woods,B: california,C: front yard,D: conservatory,E: tropical forest, Knowledge: A ficus is a type of indoor plant that typically requires a warm, humid environment with bright, indirect light. A conservatory is a type of room or greenhouse specifically designed for growing plants, making it the most likely option for a personal ficus to thrive. The other options do not provide the necessary conditions for a ficus, as they are either outdoor environments or lack the necessary humidity and light sources. Answer is
--target-- conservatory

Options: A: court room,B: shallow waters,C: poker game,D: sea world,E: pond arena, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the shark was used in a legal setting as evidence, so it is most likely that the legal team brought it to a court room. The other options are unlikely and do not fit the context of the sentence. Shallow waters or a pond arena would not make sense as a place to present legal evidence, and sea world and a poker game also do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- court room
--input-- Question: If the president wanted to ban snakes, where would he issue such a decree? Options: A: street,B: tropical forest,C: garden of eden,D: new mexico,E: white house, Knowledge: The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. It is where the President typically issues official decrees, executive orders, and other important statements. Banning snakes would require a formal government decision, and the White House would likely be the location where such a decision would be made. The other options, such as a street, tropical forest, or Garden of Eden, do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. New Mexico may be a possible location for snakes, but it does not have any relevance to where the ban would be issued. Answer is
--target-- White House

Options: A: park,B: calm,C: being good,D: good behavior,E: safe, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child in question has a problem with hyperactivity, which may require them to learn techniques for controlling and calming their behavior. The most appropriate answer in this case is "calm," which is a direct opposite of hyperactivity. The other options, such as "park" or "safe," do not relate to the context of the sentence and would not help address the child's hyperactivity. "Being good" and "good behavior" are too general and do not specify an appropriate action to address hyperactivity. Answer is

Out of the choices given, only "living room" is a common area found in a typical home entrance. "A chair" and "bathroom" are not typically found in home entrances, while "school" would not be relevant to the context of wiping feet on a doormat. "Doorway" is a possible answer, but it is not as specific as "living room" and could refer to any entrance. Answer is
--target-- living room
--input-- Question: What can you use to store a book while traveling? Options: A: library of congress,B: pocket,C: backpack,D: suitcase,E: synagogue, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the book needs to be transported while traveling, and the options provided are all potential storage options. The library of congress and synagogue are unlikely choices for storing individual books while traveling.

In this context, backpack is likely a better choice as it is more portable and easier to access while on the move. Answer is
--target-- backpack
--input-- Question: Where would you find gazelle under a G? Options: A: open field,B: ivory coast,C: dictionary,D: steppe,E: encyclopedia, Knowledge: The question seems to be a wordplay or a riddle, where the answer is a word that starts with the letter G and has gazelle in it.

Options: A: coolness,B: fan,C: get wet,D: coldness,E: air conditioning, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the option being looked for is a device that can be used to reduce the heat in a home. Among the choices provided, only air conditioning is commonly used for this purpose. A fan may help circulate air, but it does not reduce the temperature, while getting wet may provide temporary relief but is not a practical solution. Additionally, the terms "coolness" and "coldness" are not typically used to refer to specific devices or methods for cooling a house. Answer is
--target-- air conditioning
--input-- Question: Where would you store a pillow case that is not in use? Options: A: kitchen cupboard,B: bedding store,C: england,D: drawer,E: bedroom, Knowledge: Pillow cases are typically items used in the bedroom, so it would make sense to store them in a drawer within the same space. The other options do not have any relevant connection to the context of the question. A kitchen cupboard is unlikely to be used for storing pillowcases, and the option "bedding store" is incorrect as it suggests storing the pillowcase in a retail location rather than in a personal space. Finally, the option "England" is completely unrelated and does not provide any helpful information for answering the question. Answer is
--target-- drawer

Options: A: living room,B: parlor,C: music hall,D: music room,E: museum, Knowledge: A clavichord is a musical instrument, so it is likely that a teacher who owns one would keep it in a room specifically designated for music-related activities. The options "living room" and "parlor" are more general living spaces and not typically associated with specific activities. "Music hall" implies a larger public space, whereas a clavichord is usually a smaller instrument for personal use. "Museum" is not likely a place where someone would keep their personal instrument.

Options: A: partner,B: trust,C: cooperation,D: bricks,E: herpes, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the couple is feeling secure in their relationship as they kiss each other goodbye. The mention of a "strong foundation" narrows down the answer choices to qualities that are commonly associated with stable relationships, such as trust. Trust is a fundamental aspect of any healthy relationship, and it would make sense for the couple to feel relaxed as they part ways if they have a strong level of trust in each other. The other options, such as partner, cooperation, bricks, or herpes, do not fit the context of the sentence or are irrelevant to the topic of relationships. Answer is
--target-- trust
--input-- Question: Why would you take a bus to work? Options: A: commute,B: flying,C: get somewhere,D: travel,E: go home, Knowledge: The word "commute" refers specifically to the act of traveling to and from work on a regular basis.

"Get somewhere" and "travel" could apply to any type of trip, not necessarily work-related. "Go home" implies the end of the workday, not the trip to work. Answer is
--target-- commute

--target-- defend

Diseases are known to attack living organisms, such as plants and animals, including humans. Out of the given choices, only the human body is a living organism that can be affected by a disease. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- human body
--input-- Question: What does a person from Avalon live in? Options: A: pain,B: meaningful work,C: english house,D: cotton candy,E: headache, Knowledge: The question is asking about where a person from Avalon lives, which suggests that Avalon is a place. "English house" is a common term for a certain style of architecture, which is associated with England, suggesting that Avalon is located in England or has some connections to English culture. The other options, such as "pain," "meaningful work," and "cotton candy," do not make sense in the context of the question. "Headache" is a possible answer, but it does not fit as well as "English house" in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- english house
--input-- Question: Where is one likely to find a fan for their stove? Options: A: appliance store,B: sports stadium,C: dress emporium,D: hot room,E: football stadium, Knowledge: A fan for a stove is a common household appliance used to circulate air and improve heating efficiency. Therefore, it is most likely to be found in an appliance store where household items are sold. The other options (sports stadium, dress emporium, hot room, football stadium) have no connection to the context of the sentence and do not suggest any possibility of finding a fan for a stove. Answer is
--target-- appliance store
--input-- Question: Jodie felt a tightness in her chest. She was worried but didn't want to go to the hospital. Where might she go instead? Options: A: istanbul,B: concert,C: bedroom,D: antique shop,E: human being, Knowledge: The context suggests that Jodie is experiencing a physical symptom and is hesitant to seek medical attention. In such a scenario, going to a calm and familiar place like the bedroom might help alleviate some of the anxiety and discomfort. The other options do not seem to offer a suitable alternative for seeking medical help. Answer is
--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: If you're buying beer for a float trip what are you preparing to do? Options: A: get arrested,B: have fun,C: get sick,D: spend money,E: stupidity, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the activity of buying beer for a float trip is associated with a leisure activity or recreation, which is commonly associated with having fun. The other options do not make sense in this context or are negative connotations. Answer is
--target-- have fun
--input-- Question: Piece of land in Canada where you can find marmot? Options: A: north america,B: united states,C: vancouver island,D: american,E: cage, Knowledge: The sentence states that marmots can be found on a piece of land in Canada, which narrows down the possible answers to North America and Vancouver Island. However, the United States and American are not accurate because they do not refer specifically to Canada. Cage is also not relevant because it does not relate to the topic of the sentence. Therefore, Vancouver Island is the correct answer as it is a specific location in Canada where marmots can be found. Answer is
--target-- Vancouver Island
--input-- Question: The surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, it seemed girls no longer want to what? Options: A: reduction,B: make larger,C: augment,D: gain weight,E: expand, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the surgeon's clients are reducing in number because girls no longer want to do something. The options "reduction" and "make larger" do not fit the context of the sentence since they describe actions rather than the desired outcome. "Expand" and "gain weight" are also unlikely options since they are not commonly associated with the work of a surgeon. "Augment" is the most logical choice since it refers to the process of enhancing or increasing something, which could describe the desired outcome of a surgical procedure for girls. Answer is
--target-- augment
--input-- Question: While waiting for this appointment, people often read magazines. Options: A: doctor,B: train station,C: newsagent,D: market,E: table, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are waiting for an appointment while they read magazines, which is a common scenario in a doctor's office. People often read magazines to pass the time while waiting to see a healthcare professional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- doctor
--input-- Question: Where would you find a fox that is made up? Options: A: storybook,B: woods,C: hen house,D: natural habitat,E: back yard, Knowledge: The word "made up" suggests that the fox is not real and exists only in fiction. Therefore, the most likely place to find a "made up" fox is in a storybook, which is a collection of fictional stories. The other options such as woods, hen house, natural habitat, and back yard are all associated with real-life locations where one might find real foxes. Answer is
--target-- storybook
--input-- Question: In basic training they build you up only to do what, all in hopes of building you up even stronger the next time? Options: A: destroying,B: tear down,C: raze,D: mutilate,E: demolition, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in basic training, someone is initially built up, only to be torn down afterwards. This is a common practice in military training, where recruits are pushed beyond their physical and mental limits to prepare them for the rigors of military life. The other options, such as "destroying", "raze", "mutilate", and "demolition", do not accurately reflect the process of building up and tearing down in basic training. Answer is
--target-- tear down
--input-- Question: Billy saw a dog running from him and did his best to get away from it.  The leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach and was stuck.  Where might he have been trapped? Options: A: kennel,B: table,C: porch,D: backyard,E: park, Knowledge: The sentence states that Billy leaped up to a place where the dog couldn't reach him and got stuck. Kennel, porch, backyard, and park do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, a table is a piece of furniture that Billy could have leaped onto and got stuck, especially if it was unstable or hard to get down from. Therefore, the correct answer is most likely table. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: John and Judy were parents.  They had two wonderful kids who weren't always well behaved.  They were light tough, though.  They felt it was a parent's job to do what? Options: A: control children,B: guide children,C: speak freely,D: cry,E: understand children, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Judy had a specific perspective on parenting, which is that guiding their children was a crucial part of their role as parents. While it is possible that they also believed in controlling their children's behavior to some degree, the emphasis on the children not always being well-behaved implies that they understood that children need guidance and support to grow and develop. The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or are too vague to be a clear answer. Answer is
--target-- guide children
--input-- Question: What are you playing if you're fiddling on a violin? Options: A: bluegrass music,B: make music,C: drop,D: string instrument,E: troubles, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that someone is playing something on a violin, which is a type of string instrument. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "make music" is too vague to be a definitive answer without additional information. Answer is
--target-- string instrument
--input-- Question: If somebody buys something and gives it to me as a free gift, what is the cost status of the gift? Options: A: deadly,B: imprisoned,C: paid for,D: expensive,E: in prison, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that someone bought something and then gave it to the speaker as a free gift. This implies that the item was purchased with money, and therefore was paid for. The other options do not make sense in this context - "deadly" and "expensive" are not relevant to the cost status of a gift, while "imprisoned" and "in prison" are completely unrelated. Answer is
--target-- paid for
--input-- Question: Why does someone flirt with many people at once? Options: A: have sex,B: get laid,C: were lonely,D: attract attention,E: dance, Knowledge: Flirting is often used as a way to attract someone's attention and express interest. However, choosing options like "have sex" or "get laid" is not necessarily a correct answer as it implies that the sole purpose of flirting is to have sexual encounters. Similarly, "were lonely" may be a reason why someone may flirt, but it is not a universal reason. "Dance" is also not a valid option as it has no clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- attract attention
--input-- Question: James tore the antenna off of his boat due to bad reception as he was crossing the channel from France.  Where was he going? Options: A: river,B: television,C: india,D: england,E: europe, Knowledge: The sentence mentions "crossing the channel from France," which suggests that James was likely traveling by sea. The options "river," "television," and "India" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, while "Europe" is too broad and does not specify a specific destination. "England" is the only option that is geographically close to France and makes sense as a logical destination for a boat crossing the channel. Answer is
--target-- England
--input-- Question: Why would a band be performing when there are no people nearby? Options: A: record album,B: play music,C: hold concert,D: blaring,E: practice, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the band is playing music, but there are no people nearby. This implies that they are not performing for an audience, but rather they are practicing their music. The other options (recording an album, holding a concert, playing music, and blaring) all involve playing music for some kind of audience or purpose, whereas practicing is something musicians do to improve their playing ability without any expectation of an audience. Answer is
--target-- practice
--input-- Question: The dogs were protecting their own when they decided to what the bad man? Options: A: bad breath,B: defend,C: run fast,D: ocean,E: attack, Knowledge: The sentence strongly implies that the dogs were acting in a defensive or protective manner when they made their decision. The option "defend" is a similar word to the one used in the sentence and therefore a likely correct answer. "Run fast" and "ocean" are completely unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. "Bad breath" is a non-sequitur and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Attack" fits the context and is a likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- attack
--input-- Question: What is used to grind wheat for bread? Options: A: farmer's field,B: countryside,C: cereal packets,D: bread,E: mill, Knowledge: The sentence implies that wheat needs to be ground in order to make bread, and the most common tool for grinding wheat is a mill. Farmers may grow wheat in their fields, but they typically do not grind it themselves. Cereal packets contain processed grains that have already been ground and are ready for consumption. Bread is the end product of the wheat-grinding process, not the tool used to grind it. The countryside is not relevant to the question, as it does not provide any information about the process of making bread. Answer is
--target-- mill
--input-- Question: If you have a large satchel with you when you fly you'll be asked to store it where? Options: A: airport,B: luggage compartment,C: with the pilot,D: room,E: clothing store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you have a large satchel when you fly, you will need to store it somewhere. The options "airport," "with the pilot," "room," and "clothing store" do not make sense in this context. The most likely place to store a large satchel while flying would be in the luggage compartment, which is where most large bags are stored during a flight. Answer is
--target-- luggage compartment
--input-- Question: Where would someone keep their nylon leggings? Options: A: stockings,B: rope,C: car,D: clothing,E: drawer, Knowledge: The word "keep" suggests that the question is asking where someone would store or put their nylon leggings. "Stockings" are a type of legwear, but they usually refer to a thinner and more delicate material than nylon leggings. "Rope" and "car" are not typical storage locations for clothing. "Clothing" is too broad and doesn't specify a specific location. "Drawer" is a common storage location for clothing items like leggings. Answer is
--target-- drawer
--input-- Question: If you spend a long time running after a ball how are you likely to feel? Options: A: laughter,B: sweating,C: embarrassed,D: breathing heavily,E: tiredness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is spending a long time running after a ball, which is likely to cause physical exertion and fatigue. Sweating and breathing heavily are also possible physical reactions to running, but tiredness is a more common and expected outcome of prolonged running. Laughter and embarrassment are unlikely responses to physical exertion. Answer is
--target-- tiredness
--input-- Question: When you need to rest it's often because you have been doing what? Options: A: action,B: sleep,C: sleeping,D: in motion,E: using energy, Knowledge: Rest is typically needed when a person has depleted their energy levels and needs to recharge. The choice "using energy" closely aligns with this idea, indicating that the person has been truly active and has burned through considerable amounts of energy. The other options such as sleep, sleeping, action, and in motion, can be considered the result of fatigue and not necessarily the cause of it. Answer is
--target-- using energy
--input-- Question: Boredom and hunger led to a wandering waste of time and a cart full of unhealthy snacks during her trip to where? Options: A: new moon,B: play cards,C: read book,D: see art,E: grocery shop, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question was bored and hungry during a trip and that this led them to waste time and purchase unhealthy snacks. The most likely scenario where this could have happened is during a visit to a grocery store. The other options, such as "new moon," "play cards," "read book," and "see art," do not have any clear connection to the situation described in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- grocery shop
--input-- Question: He was beginning to worry they wouldn't get on the ride before closing, they had been standing in queue for a long what? Options: A: frustration,B: waiting,C: hair,D: time,E: patience, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the person is worrying about not being able to get on the ride before closing, which implies that they have been waiting in a line or queue. The word "queue" also suggests waiting, making "waiting" the most likely answer. "Time" is also a logical option because it directly relates to waiting for an extended period. The other choices ("frustration," "hair," and "patience") are not related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- time
--input-- Question: This is an unavoidable physiological consequence of running.  What is it? Options: A: breathlessness,B: increased heart rate,C: falling down,D: muscle bulk,E: calluses, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a physiological consequence that is unavoidable when running. Since running is a physical activity that requires exertion, it is logical to assume that the consequence is related to the respiratory system. Breathlessness or shortness of breath is a common symptom for runners, especially if they are running at high intensity or for a prolonged period. The other options, such as muscle bulk or calluses, are not physiological consequences of running. Falling down is a possible consequence of running but is not a physiological one. Increased heart rate is a partial consequence of running but not the only one. Answer is
--target-- breathlessness
--input-- Question: Sometimes a person has a fear of water or a dislike of being wet, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath why? Options: A: flooding,B: drowning,C: wet skin,D: get wet,E: rash, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is someone who does not like water or being wet, but it is still necessary to ensure that they have a bath. The reason for this is likely related to hygiene, as baths are a common way to wash away dirt and bacteria from the skin. The answer "wet skin" is the only choice that directly relates to the benefits of taking a bath in terms of hygiene. The other options, such as flooding or drowning, are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- wet skin
--input-- Question: Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking? Options: A: lights,B: crowd,C: university campus,D: theater,E: park, Knowledge: An auditorium is a large room or space designed for public presentations or performances. The other options do not typically have auditoriums. A theater is a common place where individual speakers may give lectures or performances to an audience. The use of the word "single" suggests that there is only one person speaking, further indicating that it is likely to be a theater rather than a place with a "crowd" or "university campus." "Lights" and "park" do not clearly match the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- theater
--input-- Question: To get out of there the person had to keep on walking, they had to keep on what? Options: A: moving forward,B: locomotion,C: blisters,D: rollerskate,E: exercise, Knowledge: The phrase "keep on walking" suggests that the person needed to continue making progress in a certain direction in order to escape from their current location. "Moving forward" is the best choice because it specifically describes the act of progressing in a forward direction. The other options (locomotion, blisters, rollerskate, and exercise) are either unrelated or only tangentially related to the idea of progressing forward. Answer is
--target-- moving forward
--input-- Question: What very large group of western citizens has bees everywhere? Options: A: united states,B: space station,C: trash can,D: field of flowers,E: bouquet of flowers, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bees are in a natural environment that is large, hence it is likely that the correct answer would be something related to nature. The reference to the western citizens is likely a red herring to throw off the reader. The options "space station" and "trash can" are unlikely because they are not related to nature. The option "bouquet of flowers" is too small to contain a large group of bees, leaving "field of flowers" as the most appropriate and likely answer. Answer is
--target-- field of flowers
--input-- Question: Miss Grady took a stick from Bob because he was playing with it during class.  She wanted to make sure that he couldn't get to it so she put it where? Options: A: desk drawer,B: kitchen drawer,C: classroom,D: pocket,E: office, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Miss Grady took a stick from Bob during class, which suggests that the location where she put the stick was likely within the classroom. The options "kitchen drawer" and "office" are unlikely because they suggest a location outside of the classroom. "Pocket" is also unlikely because it would not be a secure location if Miss Grady wanted to make sure that Bob could not get to it. Therefore, "desk drawer" is the most sensible option, as it is a secure location within the classroom. Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: How does a person begin reproducing? Options: A: genetic mutation,B: have sex,C: kiss,D: flirting,E: going on a date, Knowledge: Reproduction involves the fusion of a sperm cell from a male and an egg cell from a female, which usually occurs through sexual intercourse. Genetic mutation refers to a change in DNA that can lead to variation in offspring, but it is not usually the mechanism by which reproduction occurs. Kissing, flirting, and going on a date may be part of the process leading up to reproduction, but they are not the actual act of reproduction itself. Answer is
--target-- have sex
--input-- Question: Joe and Jill didn't want their children to be sedentary.  They might limit the time they children spend doing what? Options: A: play sports,B: throw things,C: reading,D: watch tv,E: play with toys, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe and Jill are concerned about their children being inactive, which may lead to sedentary behavior. Watching TV is a common sedentary activity that involves sitting in one place for extended periods of time. Play sports, throw things, and playing with toys are all physical activities that would encourage movement and reduce sedentary behavior. Reading could be either sedentary or active, depending on the circumstances. However, the sentence specifically implies that Joe and Jill are worried about their children being sedentary, so watching TV is the best answer. Answer is
--target-- watch TV
--input-- Question: They were making sauerkraut, the instructor explained the liquid should be above the cabbage in the what? Options: A: jar,B: drinking glass,C: pot,D: container,E: can, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the process being described involves fermenting cabbage to create sauerkraut, which is often done in jars. The instructor mentions that the liquid should be above the cabbage, indicating that the cabbage should be fully submerged in the liquid to properly ferment. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- jar
--input-- Question: From where would you normally take a cup when you're about to get a drink? Options: A: dishwasher,B: water fountain,C: sand box,D: toilet,E: kitchen cabinet, Knowledge: The kitchen is typically the place where cups are stored and used for drinking. The dishwasher is where cups are cleaned after use, not where they are normally taken from to get a drink. The water fountain is a public drinking source that does not involve cups. The sand box and toilet are not appropriate places from which to take a cup. Answer is
--target-- kitchen cabinet
--input-- Question: What are you using if there are speakers strapped on your ears? Options: A: take it all in,B: headphones,C: desktop,D: conference,E: concert, Knowledge: The sentence describes speakers being strapped on the ears, which is a common way of describing the use of headphones. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- headphones
--input-- Question: Because of his anger he couldn't clearly explain or what? Options: A: cool off,B: write letter,C: get mad,D: illustrate point,E: destroy enemy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was too angry to explain something clearly. Therefore, the correct answer must be an action that would require clear explanation. "Illustrate point" is an action that requires clear communication and explanation, making it the correct answer. "Cool off" and "write letter" could be possible actions to take after calming down, but they do not necessarily require clear explanation. "Get mad" and "destroy enemy" do not align with the context and are too extreme in comparison to the other options. Answer is
--target-- illustrate point
--input-- Question: Where is likely to not just have a kosher restaurant? Options: A: jerusalem,B: jewish neighborhoods,C: dining in,D: new york city,E: dining, Knowledge: The question asks for a location that is unlikely to have a kosher restaurant, which means we need to eliminate options that are more likely to have one. Jerusalem and Jewish neighborhoods are both associated with the Jewish faith and culture, so it's likely that they would have kosher restaurants. New York City has a large Jewish population and is known for its diverse food culture, so it's also likely to have kosher restaurants available. "Dining in" doesn't specify a location, but it generally refers to eating at home instead of at a restaurant, so it's a safe choice for an option that is unlikely to have a kosher restaurant. Answer is
--target-- dining in
--input-- Question: The bald eagle flew from Mount St Helen's to the Puget Sound and all over what? Options: A: washington state,B: utah,C: pacific northwest,D: northern california,E: the desert, Knowledge: Mount St. Helen's and Puget Sound are both located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Therefore, it is more likely that the bald eagle would fly all over the Pacific Northwest rather than other geographic locations like Utah or the desert. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- pacific northwest
--input-- Question: Where could you get some knives if you are planning to bring them outside with you? Options: A: sporting goods store,B: backpack,C: kitchen,D: sharp edges,E: dog house, Knowledge: The question asks where you could obtain knives to bring outside with you, which suggests that you are looking for knives suitable for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or hunting. Sporting goods stores typically sell a range of outdoor equipment, including knives specifically designed for these types of activities. The other options (backpack, kitchen, sharp edges, dog house) are not places where you would commonly find knives suitable for outdoor use. Answer is
--target-- sporting goods store
--input-- Question: How can people fulfill their own calorie requirements? Options: A: compete with each other,B: feed themselves,C: feel lonely,D: talk to each other,E: ask a doctor, Knowledge: The sentence is referring to people fulfilling their calorie requirements, which is typically accomplished by consuming food. Therefore, the correct answer is "feed themselves." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- feed themselves
--input-- Question: What does a stove do to the place that it's in? Options: A: cool house,B: warm room,C: gas or electric,D: burn child,E: brown meat, Knowledge: Stoves are typically used to generate heat, whether through gas or electric power sources. The options "cool house," "gas or electric," and "burn child" are not accurate descriptions of what a stove does to the place it's in. While stoves can be used for cooking, the option "brown meat" does not capture the primary purpose of a stove, which is to generate heat. Therefore, "warm room" is the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- warm room
--input-- Question: What is the best way to begin going into trance? Options: A: religious experience,B: closed eyes,C: loss of control,D: sleep,E: hallucination, Knowledge: Going into trance often involves a state of relaxation and focus, and many techniques involve closing one's eyes to shut out external distractions and increase internal awareness. Religious experiences and hallucinations may be related to trance in some contexts, but they are not necessarily the best ways to initiate the state. Loss of control and sleep may also be associated with trance, but they do not provide specific guidance on how to begin the process. Answer is
--target-- closed eyes
--input-- Question: A computer user working on an important work assignment is located in what structure? Options: A: office building,B: internet cafe,C: house,D: school,E: internet cafe, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the computer user is working on an important work assignment, indicating that they are either an employee or a freelancer. It is unlikely that someone working on a work assignment would do so in a location like an internet cafe, which is a public space that may not provide the necessary level of privacy and security. A house or school may be possible locations, but an office building is the most likely option since it is a dedicated space for work-related activities. The option "internet cafe" is repeated and therefore, incorrect. Answer is
--target-- office building
--input-- Question: The music was festive but why are the horses dancing in circles Options: A: carnival,B: night club,C: theatre,D: opera,E: ringmaster, Knowledge: The use of the word "festive" suggests that the context may be related to a celebration or a party atmosphere. The mention of horses dancing in circles is likely referring to a carnival or circus, which often feature horses performing in shows. The other options, such as night club, theater, and opera, do not have a clear connection to the context of horses dancing in circles. Ringmaster may be somewhat related, but it is not clear whether the context involves a circus or carnival. Answer is
--target-- carnival
--input-- Question: In the building where James worked there was a small mezzanine in the auditorium to make more space for seats.  Where might James work? Options: A: theater,B: floors,C: concert hall,D: education,E: school, Knowledge: The sentence mentions an "auditorium" and a "mezzanine" which are both commonly associated with theaters. A mezzanine is a level intermediate between the main floor and the next higher floor, and is often found in theaters to provide additional seating. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- theater
--input-- Question: If you aren't well rested and it's a rainy day what might you do? Options: A: sleep,B: write,C: make bread,D: stay in bed,E: enjoy film, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is not well rested and it is a rainy day, which may imply that they do not need to go out or do something active. Instead, they might want to stay in bed and relax. The other options may not be as appropriate because they do not necessarily promote rest and relaxation. Answer is
--target-- stay in bed
--input-- Question: Where would you have a stove if you don't live in a detached dwelling? Options: A: tent,B: car,C: living room,D: friend's house,E: apartment, Knowledge: The question implies that the person does not live in a detached dwelling, which suggests they may live in a multi-unit building like an apartment. In an apartment, a stove would typically be located in the kitchen, whereas in other options like a tent or car, this would not be the case. The living room and friend's house options are also unlikely locations for a stove, as they are not designated areas for cooking. Answer is
--target-- apartment
--input-- Question: What kind of place has a revolving door and has things to buy in it? Options: A: new york,B: public place,C: bank,D: mall,E: supermarket door, Knowledge: Revolving doors are commonly found in malls and other commercial buildings. Additionally, malls typically have a variety of stores and items available for purchase. Public places, banks, and supermarkets may also have revolving doors, but the presence of things to buy is more closely associated with a mall. New York is a city and does not inherently have a revolving door or things to buy in it. Answer is
--target-- mall
--input-- Question: Where can books be read? Options: A: cabinet,B: backpack,C: table,D: shelf,E: sink, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a location where books can be read. While books can be stored on a shelf or in a cabinet, they cannot be read there. Similarly, books cannot be read in a backpack or a sink. A table, however, is a surface commonly used for reading, studying, and writing, making it the most likely option for the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: Where is seaweed usually found alive? Options: A: ocean,B: found in ocean,C: water,D: found in sea,E: beach, Knowledge: Seaweed is a type of marine plant that grows in the ocean, so the correct answer is "ocean".

--target-- ocean
--input-- Question: If a lizard is fed by people every day, what has happened to it? Options: A: documentary,B: costa rica,C: garden,D: encouragement,E: captivity, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard is being regularly fed by people, which is a behavior that is commonly observed in captive animals. Animals in the wild typically need to forage for food and are not reliant on humans for their survival. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- captivity
--input-- Question: What will happen to someone if his or her spirits cannot elevate? Options: A: sadden,B: demote,C: depress,D: drop,E: decrease, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone's spirits cannot elevate, they will likely experience a negative emotion or state. "Depress" is the closest choice to this idea, as it means to make someone feel sad or hopeless. "Sadden" and "drop" are similar, but do not carry the same connotation of a prolonged or chronic state. "Demote" and "decrease" do not fit the context of the sentence at all. Answer is
--target-- depress
--input-- Question: If you wanted a license to catch crabs, what government office would you go to? Options: A: most offices,B: fish department,C: fancy restaurant,D: government submarine,E: chesapeake bay, Knowledge: The question is asking about obtaining a license to catch crabs, which suggests that the office responsible for granting such licenses would be related to fishing or marine life. The option "fish department" is the most relevant choice as it directly refers to an office that deals with fish and marine life. The other options, such as "government submarine" or "fancy restaurant," are not related to the context of the question and are therefore incorrect. Answer is
--target-- fish department

Options: A: end of line,B: hobby shop,C: his hand,D: toy store,E: child's hand, Knowledge: The sentence states that James traced the string back to its origin, indicating that he was the one who had been holding the string.

--input-- Question: What rubber toy filled with helium will make a child happy? Options: A: loved,B: learn,C: eat cake,D: balloon,E: become adult, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a rubber toy filled with helium, which is a clear reference to a balloon.

--input-- Question: Where do people get beer after a bit of gambling? Options: A: bottle,B: grocery store,C: casino,D: spaceship,E: hockey game, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are gambling and then getting beer, which indicates that the location must be a place where both activities are commonly found.

--target-- casino
--input-- Question: What can happen to you when you are using television and it is not interesting? Options: A: turn off,B: functions,C: turning off,D: entertainment,E: fall asleep, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the use of television is boring or uninteresting, which can lead to a state of drowsiness or falling asleep.

--input-- Question: Where is a likely place for an ivy plant? Options: A: flower pot,B: shelf,C: windowsill,D: outside,E: sill, Knowledge: Ivy plants are often seen growing on walls or structures outside, as they have a tendency to attach themselves to surfaces using small roots.

Options: A: brownstone,B: hotel,C: condominium,D: entering building,E: office building, Knowledge: A stoop is a set of steps leading up to a raised entrance of a building. Brownstones are a type of row house commonly found in certain cities, such as New York and Boston, which have a distinct stoop leading up to the front door. Hotels, condominiums, entering buildings, and office buildings may have entrances with steps, but they are not typically referred to as a stoop, making brownstone the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- brownstone
--input-- Question: If the wood texture is not smooth it is what? Options: A: gilded,B: porous,C: solid,D: painted,E: less dense than water, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a texture issue with the wood. The word "smooth" implies that the surface of the wood should be free of any roughness or irregularities. Of the given options, only "porous" refers to a texture that is not smooth. Porous wood has small holes or pores on the surface, which make it less smooth to the touch. The other options do not describe a lack of smoothness in texture, or do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- porous
--input-- Question: What might happen if someone is not losing weight? Options: A: loose skin,B: beauty,C: miss universe,D: death,E: healthier, Knowledge: The question is asking about the potential consequence of not losing weight, which suggests that the person may have previously been overweight or obese. When someone loses a significant amount of weight, their skin can become loose and saggy because it has lost the elasticity that was previously stretched out. This is a common concern for people who are trying to lose weight, especially if they are losing a large amount of weight quickly. The other options are not logical consequences of not losing weight, with "miss universe" and "healthier" being positive outcomes rather than negative ones, and "death" being an extreme and unlikely consequence in most cases. Answer is
--target-- loose skin
--input-- Question: Billy lived in the capital of his country, then he moved.  Where might he move to? Options: A: small town,B: jail,C: lower case,D: contain governmental activities,E: lowercase, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy originally lived in a large city, which is typically associated with being the capital of a country. If he moved from the city, it would make sense that he would move to a smaller town or city, rather than jail or a place associated with governmental activities. "Lowercase" is not a plausible answer as it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- small town
--input-- Question: Making a schedule was easy to pick, the major called for knowledge that required a certain what? Options: A: color,B: class,C: meeting,D: university,E: encyclopedia, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the process of making a schedule was easy, but there was a specific aspect related to the major that required additional knowledge. The word "major" indicates that this is likely related to a course of study in higher education, and the use of the word "class" is commonly associated with college courses. The other options, such as color or encyclopedia, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- class
--input-- Question: When getting in shape, this is something that does wonders? Options: A: eat more,B: starve,C: give up,D: period of recovery,E: jogging, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting in shape requires some kind of physical activity, which can have a positive effect on the body. Jogging is a form of exercise that is known to improve cardiovascular health, burn calories, and strengthen muscles, which makes it a good choice for someone who wants to get in shape. Eating more or giving up on exercise altogether would not have a positive effect on someone's fitness goals, and starving oneself is never a healthy or sustainable approach. A period of recovery may be necessary after a workout, but it is not something that "does wonders" for getting in shape. Answer is
--target-- jogging
--input-- Question: What could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive? Options: A: automobile accidents,B: backache,C: pollution,D: smoke,E: low fuel tank, Knowledge: The question is asking for the factor that could physically prevent a driving car from continuing to drive. The choice of "low fuel tank" makes sense because it could cause the car to come to a complete stop and be unable to continue driving. The other options may affect the driver's ability to continue driving (such as backache or smoke), but would not physically prevent the car from moving forward. Automobile accidents, while a potential cause for a car to stop moving, are not a preventative factor that could stop a car from continuing to drive, and pollution is not directly related to the function of a car. Answer is
--target-- low fuel tank
--input-- Question: Where do you store a large container? Options: A: supermarket,B: factory,C: juice,D: hostel,E: cabinet, Knowledge: The word "container" implies a large object that needs to be stored somewhere. The options "supermarket," "juice," "hostel," and "cabinet" do not make sense as places to store large containers. A factory, however, is a place where large items are often stored, as it is a space dedicated to industrial production and manufacturing. Answer is
--target-- factory
--input-- Question: What is a person likely to experience after they stop being married to a mean person? Options: A: isolation,B: grief,C: happiness,D: relief,E: angry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person who is no longer married to a mean person may experience something positive as a result. Given the negative connotation of the word "mean," it is likely that the person will feel relieved to be free from the negativity and mistreatment associated with the previous relationship. The other options are less likely because they do not correspond well with the context of the sentence. For example, "isolation" doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that the person is no longer married to someone mean, and "angry" is not a typical response to an end of a bad relationship. Answer is
--target-- relief
--input-- Question: Despite the large crowds, how did the depressed man feel? Options: A: small group,B: alone,C: solitary,D: solitude,E: panic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there were many people around, but the man still felt a certain way. The choices "small group," "solitary," and "solitude" all suggest a lack of other people around, which contradicts the initial sentence. "Panic" suggests a strong reaction to the crowds, but the sentence suggests that the man's mood is more subdued. "Alone" is the most appropriate answer as it suggests a feeling of isolation and detachment even when surrounded by others. Answer is
--target-- alone
--input-- Question: Where does a maid empty a trash can? Options: A: bus stop,B: corner,C: hockey game,D: motel,E: alley, Knowledge: The word "maid" suggests that the context of the sentence is related to housekeeping or cleaning services.

Answer is
--target-- motel
--input-- Question: The dog curled up for a nap, it was tuckered out because it had just been what? Options: A: walked,B: petted,C: affection,D: go outside,E: scratch, Knowledge: The phrase "tuckered out" suggests that the dog is tired or exhausted, which is commonly associated with physical activity. Of the given choices, "walked" is the most physically demanding option for a dog, while the other choices do not necessarily require a lot of physical energy. "Petted" and "affection" are emotions that do not cause physical exhaustion, while "go outside" and "scratch" do not necessarily involve physical activity. Answer is
--target-- walked
--input-- Question: He used an umbrella while tanning, where was he likely? Options: A: waves,B: seattle,C: suitcase,D: beach,E: jacket closet, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person was using an umbrella while tanning, which suggests they were seeking shade from the sun. The most likely location for this scenario is a beach, where people often use umbrellas or other types of shade to protect themselves from the sun while enjoying the sand and water. The other choices don't fit the context of the sentence as well - waves, seattle, suitcase, and jacket closet don't have any clear connection to the use of an umbrella while tanning. Answer is
--target-- beach
--input-- Question: What do the feathers look like on birds found in the rainforest? Options: A: pretty smart,B: singing,C: dark,D: very colorful,E: light, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about the appearance of bird feathers in the rainforest. Rainforests are known for being home to many colorful and exotic bird species, so it's likely that the feathers of the birds found in the rainforest are also very colorful. The other options do not provide any relevant information or connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- very colorful
--input-- Question: The ancient seafaring Norse tribesman brought pelts of weasel aboard his what? Options: A: rabbit warren,B: used car lot,C: chicken coop,D: cruise,E: viking ship, Knowledge: The context suggests that the sentence is referring to a specific group of people who were known for seafaring and using pelts. The word "Norse" indicates that the group is likely from Scandinavia, and "viking ship" is the most logical choice for a transportation method for this group. The other options are unrelated and do not make sense in the given context. Answer is
--target-- viking ship
--input-- Question: What is the opposite of an area of elevation? Options: A: disgust,B: reduction,C: depression,D: demotion,E: diminishment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the word being sought refers to the opposite of an "area of elevation." An area of elevation is typically a high point, such as a mountain or hill, while a depression is a low point or dip in the ground. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- depression
--input-- Question: What do singers need to do before a show? Options: A: warm up,B: use microphones,C: clear throats,D: create music,E: sound beautiful, Knowledge: Singers typically need to warm up their vocal cords to prepare for a performance. This helps to prevent strain or injury to their voice and ensures that they are able to perform at their best. Using microphones and clearing throats are common practices as well, but they are usually part of the actual performance rather than preparation. Creating music and sounding beautiful are general characteristics of being a singer, but they do not specifically relate to what singers need to do before a show. Answer is
--target-- warm up
--input-- Question: When a person with mental illness receives medication and therapy, what has happened? Options: A: cause irrational behaviour,B: recur,C: effectively treated,D: managed,E: cause suffering, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that medication and therapy have been effective in improving the mental illness of the person mentioned. "Cause irrational behaviour," "recur," and "cause suffering" all suggest negative outcomes and do not fit with the idea of successfully managing a mental illness. "Managed" could be a possible answer, but "effectively treated" implies a more positive and successful outcome. Answer is
--target-- effectively treated
--input-- Question: What type of feeling is performing for the first time likely to produce? Options: A: action,B: butterflies,C: happiness,D: a sense of calm,E: anxiety, Knowledge: The phrase "performing for the first time" suggests that the person in question is likely inexperienced or nervous. It is common for people to feel anxious or nervous before a new experience or performance, especially if they are not used to being in the spotlight or performing in front of others. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the typical emotional response to performing for the first time. Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: If someone is found to be committing murder, what did they do to someone? Options: A: misery,B: kill,C: distress,D: tickel,E: go to jail, Knowledge: The question is referring to the act of committing murder, which means intentionally causing someone's death. The other options (misery, distress, tickle) do not align with the severity of the crime being discussed. The last option (go to jail) is a consequence of committing murder, not an action that was taken towards someone else. Answer is
--target-- kill
--input-- Question: The computer was hooked up to the internet, what could it do as a result? Options: A: process information,B: believe in god,C: make decisions,D: process information,E: receive data, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the computer was connected to the internet, which means it can receive data from the internet. Processing information is a general function of a computer, but it is not specific to being connected to the internet. Believing in God and making decisions are not related to the technical capabilities of a computer. Answer is
--target-- receive data
--input-- Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what? Options: A: toxic,B: uninhabitable,C: mercury sulphide,D: poisonous,E: jupiter, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Mercury is not hospitable to human beings. The word "unsuitable" suggests that there is a characteristic of the planet that makes it challenging for humans to live there. Mercury is too close to the sun, so it has extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation levels that are harmful to humans, making it uninhabitable. The other choices, such as "toxic," "poisonous," and "mercury sulphide," do not suitably answer the question and may mislead the individuals. "Jupiter" is a gas giant and cannot support human life. Answer is
--target-- uninhabitable

Options: A: build,B: anxiety,C: celebrate,D: very nice,E: ocean, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was nervous or anxious as they got closer to realizing their dream of being on stage.

Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: A creek could be located in the opposite for the city which is called what? Options: A: meadow,B: stick,C: valley,D: forest,E: countryside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the creek is opposite to the city, which implies that it is in a rural or natural environment away from urban development. Out of the given choices, countryside is the only option that fits this description. A meadow is generally a flat, open area of land with grass and flowers, stick does not make logical sense in this context, a valley is a low point between the mountains or hills, and a forest refers to a large area of trees or woods. None of these options specifically suggest a location opposite to the city. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: Where off the eastern U.S. would you find an anemone? Options: A: flower bed,B: tide pool,C: florida keys,D: coral sea,E: aquarium, Knowledge: Anemones are sea creatures commonly found in tide pools, which are shallow pools of seawater that are left behind when the tide recedes. They are known for their colorful tentacles and resemble flowers, which may explain why they are called anemones. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to find anemones. Answer is
--target-- tide pool
--input-- Question: Where are traveling clothes often kept? Options: A: suitcase,B: bedroom,C: closet,D: draws,E: dresser, Knowledge: Traveling clothes are typically kept in a suitcase, as this is where people store their clothing when they are on the go. A bedroom or closet may be where the suitcase is kept, but the traveling clothes themselves are not typically stored in these locations. Draws and dressers are both types of furniture that can be used for clothing storage, but they are not commonly used for traveling clothes specifically. Answer is
--target-- suitcase
--input-- Question: If one needed the bathroom they needed a key, to get it they had to also buy something from the what? Options: A: school,B: convenience store,C: rest area,D: mall,E: theater, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to get a key to access a bathroom, the person needs to buy something from a particular location. The most likely location for this would be a convenience store, as they often have public restrooms and require a purchase to receive a key or access code. The other options, such as schools and theaters, typically have free restrooms or do not require a purchase to access them. Rest areas and malls may have restrooms that require a key or code, but it is less common for them to require a purchase. Answer is
--target-- convenience store
--input-- Question: Although the sun did rise, what did the pessimist warn everyone it would do? Options: A: lay,B: go down,C: fall,D: below,E: sundown, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pessimist warned everyone about something negative that the sun would do, which eliminates options like lay, go down, below, and sundown because they all describe the natural setting of the sun. The word "fall" suggests that the pessimist is warning everyone about a negative event that the sun will cause, like a drop in temperature or the onset of bad weather. Therefore, "fall" is the most logical answer. Answer is
--target-- fall
--input-- Question: The hardcovers were especially tall, so he removed a shelf on the what to make room? Options: A: chest of drawers,B: grocery store,C: hold alcohol,D: nightstand,E: bookcase, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed to make room for the tall hardcovers on a piece of furniture that had shelves. A bookcase is the most likely option for this because it is a piece of furniture specifically designed to hold books, which often come in varying sizes. The other options, such as a grocery store or a chest of drawers, do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- bookcase

Options: A: cape canaveral florida,B: nasa,C: battleship,D: ocean,E: trapeze, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the performer is stepping onto a launch platform, which is a common feature of a trapeze act where the performer launches themselves into the air.

--target-- trapeze

Options: A: popular,B: baked in oven,C: restaurant,D: oven,E: plate, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that paying for a pizza implies that you are in a place where pizzas are prepared and served commercially. "Restaurant" is the correct answer because it is a type of establishment where food is served and customers pay for their meals. The other options do not fit the context as they refer to the characteristics of the pizza rather than the location where it is obtained. Answer is
--target-- restaurant
--input-- Question: What would you use to find a place to stay? Options: A: mexico,B: phone book,C: town,D: city,E: sun dial, Knowledge: The phone book is a directory that lists contact information for businesses and individuals, including hotels and motels.

--input-- Question: To see new films you must? Options: A: open eyes,B: go to movies,C: kick ball,D: make art,E: look for, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to see new films, a person must take a specific action. The phrase "go to movies" is the only option that directly refers to this action, while the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Open eyes" is too general and could apply to any activity, while "kick ball" and "make art" have no relevance to watching new films. "Look for" is also too vague and does not provide enough information about what specifically a person should be looking for. Answer is
--target-- go to movies
--input-- Question: What can happen when you contemplate alone for a long time? Options: A: daydream,B: headache,C: get ideas,D: sleep,E: become distracted, Knowledge: The sentence implies that contemplating alone for a long time can lead to a certain outcome. The context suggests that this outcome is positive or at least productive. Daydreaming and becoming distracted are both possibilities that might come with contemplation, but they are not the most likely outcome in this context. A headache and sleep are not outcomes that are commonly associated with contemplation, and they do not make sense in this sentence. Getting ideas, on the other hand, is a common outcome of contemplation, especially if the contemplation is focused and deliberate. Answer is
--target-- get ideas
--input-- Question: The pioneer went to the general store for storage measures, what was he looking for? Options: A: checkers,B: barrels,C: baking soda,D: buffalo,E: salt, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the pioneer went to the general store to purchase something that is used for storage. Checkers and buffalo are not related to storage, while baking soda is not typically stored in barrels. Salt can sometimes be stored in barrels, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Barrels, on the other hand, are commonly used for storage purposes, especially in pioneer times when they were used to store food, drink, and other supplies. Therefore, the correct answer is barrels. Answer is
--target-- barrels

--target-- announce
--input-- Question: John needed a straight wire.  Unfortunately, this one had endured some abuse and had become what? Options: A: bent,B: bent,C: crooked,D: straightforth,E: curved, Knowledge: The sentence implies that John needed a straight wire, but the wire has become something else due to damage or use. The words "abuse" and "endured" suggest that the wire has undergone some sort of force or stress that has caused it to no longer be straight. The words "crooked" and "curved" both suggest that the wire is not straight, but "bent" is the most appropriate choice as it directly implies the wire was once straight but is now bowed due to external factors. The other options do not match the description in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bent
--input-- Question: Metal is taken from what which is pulled from the ground? Options: A: dirt,B: instruments,C: ore,D: car,E: junkyard, Knowledge: The sentence implies that metal is extracted from a natural resource that is found underground. The term "ore" refers to mineral deposits that contain valuable metals, such as iron, gold, and silver. Extracting metal from ore is a process that involves crushing and smelting the ore, which separates the metal from the other elements in the ore. The other options do not accurately describe the source of metal or the process by which it is obtained. Answer is
--target-- ore

Options: A: utility closet,B: outside,C: well,D: garden shed,E: garage, Knowledge: The question is asking where you would store a bucket when it is not in use, which suggests that it is a household item that needs to be easily accessible. It also uses the word "property", which implies that it is not being used outside in a specific location. Out of the choices provided, the most likely place to store a household item like a bucket would be in a utility closet. The other options are either outdoor locations or specific structures that may not be available for all households. Answer is
--target-- utility closet
--input-- Question: What does someone do to relax at night? Options: A: find time,B: check mail,C: listen to music,D: go to bed,E: stop worrying, Knowledge: The question asks about what someone does to relax at night, suggesting that the answer should be an activity that promotes sleep and relaxation. "Go to bed" is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to the context of the question. "Find time" may suggest a general approach to time management, but it does not explain what the person does to relax. "Check mail" and "listen to music" may be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily promote sleep. "Stop worrying" may be a valuable suggestion for relaxation, but it is not an activity that the person does. Answer is
--target-- go to bed
--input-- Question: Where might the stapler be if I cannot find it? Options: A: office building,B: office supply store,C: desk drawer,D: with dwight,E: desktop, Knowledge: The options "office building," "office supply store," and "with Dwight" do not seem relevant to the context of the question, which is about finding a specific object. "Desktop" is a possibility, but the phrasing of the question ("where might it be") implies that the stapler is misplaced or not in its usual location. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the stapler could be in a desk drawer, which is a common place to store office supplies. Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: Many homes in this country are built around a courtyard. Where is it? Options: A: candidate,B: spain,C: lawn,D: asshole,E: office complex, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that many homes in a particular country are built around a courtyard, suggesting that this is a common architectural feature in that country.

Options: A: cupboard,B: toolbox,C: closet,D: garage,E: mail box, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe keeps his tools in a place where spiders have been found.

Options: A: everglades,B: high places,C: natural habitat,D: new york,E: colorado, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person was on a fan boat in a nature area known for swamps and alligators. A bald eagle sighting is unexpected in this scenario and suggests that the person may have been in a location where bald eagles are known to live.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- everglades
--input-- Question: Where are you likely to find a supermarket? Options: A: buy food for family,B: city or town,C: get supplies,D: strip mall,E: vermont, Knowledge: Supermarkets are typically found in areas with a higher population density, such as cities and towns, where there is a greater demand for groceries and supplies. Strip malls may also contain supermarkets, but they are usually located in commercial areas rather than residential ones. Vermont is also not a likely answer, as it is a specific location and not a general category of where one might find a supermarket. The phrase "buy food for family" and "get supplies" may suggest a need for a supermarket, but they are not specific enough to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- city or town

Options: A: grocery store,B: antique shop,C: house,D: dark place,E: street, Knowledge: A lantern is a portable source of light that is typically used in situations where there is no access to electricity or other sources of light. The options "grocery store," "antique shop," and "house" all have access to electricity, and therefore would not require a lantern.

Answer is
--target-- dark place
--input-- Question: What area does a police officer patrol? Options: A: direct traffic,B: city,C: beat,D: street,E: park, Knowledge: "Beat" is a term commonly used to refer to the specific area or neighborhood that a police officer is assigned to patrol.

Options: A: being raped,B: get rid of,C: they didn't know the passcode,D: get revenge,E: were evil, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman acted in self-defense, which suggests that she may have been threatened or attacked in some way.

--target-- being raped

Options: A: buy food,B: open mouth,C: get out of bed,D: cry,E: wake up, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baby was refusing to do something related to eating breakfast, which is likely opening its mouth to receive food. The other options are unrelated to the context of the sentence or provide an unlikely explanation for the baby's crankiness (crying or refusing to get out of bed). The option "buy food" is also unlikely as it is unlikely that a baby would be responsible for purchasing its own food. Answer is
--target-- open mouth
--input-- Question: What is made up of people? Options: A: buildings,B: audience,C: apartment,D: classroom,E: falling down, Knowledge: The word "made up" suggests that the answer is referring to a group of people. The options "buildings," "apartment," and "falling down" are not made up of people, but physical structures or events. While a classroom contains people, it can also refer to an empty room, and the context of the sentence does not specify that it is referring to a room filled with people. "Audience" fits the criteria of being made up of people, as it is a group of individuals gathered together to watch a performance or event. Answer is
--target-- audience
--input-- Question: He was afraid he would die from his cold, so he wisely decided to what? Options: A: ocean,B: write will,C: never want,D: were shot,E: seek help, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was suffering from a serious illness (a cold) and was afraid that they might die. In such a situation, seeking help from a medical professional would be the most logical course of action, as they would be able to provide the necessary treatment and care to help the person recover. The other options (ocean, write will, never want, were shot) do not make sense in the given context. Answer is
--target-- seek help
--input-- Question: Where would you get a pen if you do not have one? Options: A: briefcase,B: desk drawer,C: friend's house,D: pocket,E: sidewalk, Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is in a location where they may have access to a desk drawer, such as an office or a classroom.

Options: A: outside,B: europe,C: heat,D: wet,E: dog show, Knowledge: Panting is a common way for dogs to regulate their body temperature, especially when they are hot.

--target-- heat

The word "because" is often used to explain why something was done, so it is likely that the little boy's response was "because." The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- because
--input-- Question: Where would you display a picture on a horizontal surface? Options: A: microwave,B: desktop,C: shelf,D: art show,E: wall, Knowledge: A horizontal surface typically refers to a flat surface that is parallel to the ground, such as a table or desk. It is common to display pictures on a flat surface in a room, such as a desktop or a shelf, especially if the picture is small or if wall space is limited. A picture displayed on a wall would be in a vertical orientation, so this option can be eliminated. A microwave is not a suitable surface for displaying pictures and an art show is an event where pictures are displayed, not a surface to display them. Answer is
--target-- desktop
--input-- Question: What skill is needed for riding a bike? Options: A: wheels,B: feet,C: pedalling,D: practice,E: good balance, Knowledge: Riding a bike requires good balance to keep the bike upright and maintain control. While wheels and pedalling are necessary components of a bike, they don't necessarily require a specific skill. Feet are used for pedalling, but balance is more important for riding a bike. Practice is important for improving one's bike riding skills, but it is not a skill in and of itself. Answer is
--target-- good balance

The term "receiving" is commonly used in retail and other industries to refer to the department or area where incoming goods are processed and stored. The other options do not relate to this context, as they either refer to taking away goods (take away) or keeping them (keep), which is not what a department for receiving goods would do. "Delivered" and "pick up" are also not correct as they do not describe the department or area where goods are received. Answer is
--target-- receiving
--input-- Question: Where is the worst place to be in a ticket office? Options: A: at the top,B: movie theaters,C: train station,D: end of line,E: opera house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being in a certain location within a ticket office is undesirable, and the phrase "end of line" means the furthest point in the queue, where you have to wait the longest.

Options: A: stretch,B: lower cholesterol,C: weigh,D: track,E: expend energy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercise is beneficial for overall health, and that doing something specific after exercise will aid in a faster recovery.

Answer is
--target-- music store
--input-- Question: Where would a person light alcohol on fire to observe the reaction? Options: A: supermarket,B: bar,C: pub,D: restaurants,E: chemistry lab, Knowledge: Lighting alcohol on fire is a common experiment in chemistry labs to study combustion reactions.

--input-- Question: Where does lettuce arrive by large trucks? Options: A: kitchen,B: supermarket,C: farmer's market,D: salad,E: refrigerator, Knowledge: The question implies that lettuce is being transported in bulk and sold at a particular location. A supermarket is the most likely option as it is a large retailer that sells a wide range of products, including fresh produce that is often transported in large trucks. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not involve the transportation of lettuce or are not a likely location for bulk produce sales. Answer is
--target-- supermarket

Options: A: rejuvenation,B: born again,C: no longer exist,D: unable to work,E: change of color, Knowledge: Social security payments are typically given to individuals who have retired and are no longer able to work. The sentence suggests that people who are dying receive these payments, which implies that they are no longer able to work due to their condition. The other options do not make sense in this context - rejuvenation and born again are religious concepts, no longer exist is too final and does not explain why they would receive payments, and change of color has no connection to the topic of social security payments. Answer is
--target-- unable to work

Options: A: airplane,B: movie,C: auditorium,D: theatre,E: show, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker entered a space, took their seat, and then the curtains were drawn back to reveal a performance. This is a common experience in a theatre setting where audiences go to watch shows. The options airplane and movie are unlikely because there would not be curtains that draw back in those settings, and the word "enjoyed" suggests that the answer likely refers to a form of entertainment. Auditorium is a more general term and while it may be used in the context of a theatre, it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- theatre
--input-- Question: What should everyone do who doesn't want to fight anymore? Options: A: explicate,B: pay tribute to king,C: hope for peace,D: wear shoes,E: do well, Knowledge: The phrase "who doesn't want to fight anymore" suggests a desire for peace in a conflict or disagreement. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to achieving peace. "Explicate" means to explain or analyze, which does not relate to the idea of peace. "Pay tribute to king" is irrelevant to the question. "Wear shoes" and "do well" are also not related to achieving peace. Therefore, the only logical answer is "hope for peace." Answer is
--target-- hope for peace
--input-- Question: Where is the ideal location for a post office? Options: A: building,B: business district,C: above ground,D: most towns,E: center of town, Knowledge: Post offices are typically found in the center of town or city, making them easily accessible to as many people as possible. Placing a post office in a building or above ground may be possible, but it is not necessarily the ideal location. Most towns may have a post office, but their location can vary. The business district may be a suitable location, but not necessarily the ideal one since not everyone lives or works in that area. Therefore, the best fit from the choices given is the center of town. Answer is
--target-- center of town
--input-- Question: Where outside of a city would a squirrel live? Options: A: roof,B: inside home,C: forest,D: yard,E: park, Knowledge: Squirrels are typically found living in trees and wooded areas, which suggests that the correct answer is likely to be a natural setting. While squirrels may occasionally venture into urban areas, it is unlikely that they would make their home on a roof or inside a home. Parks and yards may provide some habitat for squirrels, but they are not typically large enough to support a sustained population. Forests, on the other hand, offer an abundance of trees and other resources that squirrels need to survive. Answer is
--target-- forest
--input-- Question: You should watch out for snakes if floating down what African body of water? Options: A: wet grass,B: western texas,C: high grass,D: amazon river,E: tree, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there may be snakes present in a body of water and provides a clue that this body of water is located in Africa. The Amazon River is located in South America, but is known for its large number of snake species, making it the most likely correct answer. The other options, such as tree or western Texas, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- amazon river

--input-- Question: What probably has a lot of dust in the back? Options: A: closet,B: door,C: corner,D: shelf,E: library, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being referred to is located in the back and has a lot of dust, which is commonly associated with shelves that are not frequently used or cleaned. Closets, doors, and corners may also accumulate dust, but they do not have the same implied placement as "in the back." A library could also have a lot of dust, but the sentence does not imply that the object is part of a larger collection or space. Answer is
--target-- shelf

Options: A: smiling,B: smile,C: open mind,D: common interests,E: laughter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist felt welcomed and happy to be meeting new people at the comic store. The phrase "making friends" indicates that these people share some common ground or interests, which is further supported by the use of the phrase "it was nice to meet people with". The other options (smiling, smile, open mind, and laughter) do not fully capture the idea of shared interests, and are less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- common interests

Options: A: tastebud,B: retina,C: inner ear,D: nasal cavity,E: autistic, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the student's loss of balance was related to the nervousness he experienced while trying to explain what neuroepithelium is. The inner ear contains the vestibular system, which is responsible for maintaining balance and spatial orientation. Therefore, the most likely choice is the inner ear. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- inner ear
--input-- Question: What could people do that involves talking? Options: A: confession,B: state park,C: sing,D: carnival,E: opera, Knowledge: Confession is an activity that usually involves talking because it is a religious or spiritual practice in which an individual confesses their sins, mistakes, and transgressions to a clergy member or religious leader.

It implies that this activity took place in a room specifically designated for music education, which is commonly referred to as a music room. The bathroom, house, living room, and music store are unlikely locations for such an activity to take place, making them incorrect answers. Answer is
--target-- music room

Options: A: passed,B: completing,C: passed,D: passing,E: succeeding, Knowledge: The question is about a grading system where F means failing and the opposite of failing would be passing.

--input-- Question: The ball was hit over a boundary and struck an audience member.  What kind of game were they playing? Options: A: sporting event,B: sporting,C: basketball,D: society,E: ranch country, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that it was a game where a ball was hit over a boundary, which is a common feature in sports such as cricket or baseball. The term "sporting event" also implies a sense of organized competition or spectatorship, which further supports the idea that it was a game or match rather than another type of activity like "society" or "ranch country". "Basketball" is unlikely to be the correct answer since hitting a ball over a boundary is not a feature of basketball. Answer is
--target-- sporting event
--input-- Question: What is someone operating a vehicle likely to be accused of after becoming inebriated? Options: A: punish,B: arrest,C: automobile accidents,D: drunk driving,E: talking nonsense, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who operates a vehicle while inebriated may face certain consequences. In this case, the term "inebriated" suggests that the person is under the influence of alcohol, which in turn means that they are likely to be accused of "drunk driving." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- drunk driving
--input-- Question: Where would you get jewelry if you do not have any? Options: A: vault,B: suitcase,C: neighbour's house,D: department store,E: safe deposit box, Knowledge: The sentence is asking where one would acquire jewelry if they do not have any.

Options: A: job,B: boredom,C: anxiety,D: impatience,E: wisdom, Knowledge: The sentence implies that a philosopher is engaged in studies with the objective of eventually gaining something. The choices "job," "boredom," "anxiety," and "impatience" do not make sense in this context.

Options: A: ski,B: play hockey,C: summer,D: knit,E: warm, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the activity being referred to is something that young boys do on ice during the winter. Skiing and playing hockey are both common winter sports that are often done on ice, while knitting and warming oneself have no clear connection to the context. "Summer" is also not a viable option as the question specifies the winter season. Therefore, the most likely answer is "play hockey." Answer is
--target-- play hockey
--input-- Question: She loved spending money at the thrift store on knickknacks, this resulted in a lot of what on every shelf in her house? Options: A: poverty,B: clutter,C: getting,D: satisfaction,E: more happiness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman enjoys shopping for knickknacks at a thrift store, but as a result, her house has a lot of something on every shelf. The word "clutter" is often used to describe a space that is filled with too many objects and lacks organization, which makes it the most fitting choice. "Poverty" is unlikely to be the correct answer because the sentence does not suggest that the woman's spending habits are causing financial difficulties for her. "Getting" and "more happiness" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "satisfaction" is not the most precise word to describe the result of having a lot of objects on every shelf. Answer is
--target-- clutter
--input-- Question: I listened to lecture intensely, what is my goal? Options: A: gain confidence,B: concentrate,C: get attention,D: pay attention,E: stop talking, Knowledge: The word "intensely" suggests that the speaker was focused and concentrated on the lecture.

The other choices do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not relate directly to listening to a lecture. Answer is
--target-- pay attention

Options: A: program created,B: stress,C: happiness,D: ocean,E: headache, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the use of a computer is causing some kind of effect on the person. Talking to their granddaughter is a positive experience that would likely cause happiness. The option "ocean" does not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "headache" suggests a negative effect, but there is no indication in the sentence that the person is experiencing any physical discomfort. The option "program created" is irrelevant to the sentence. However, the use of technology can often lead to stress, particularly for older adults who may not be as comfortable using computers. Answer is

Convention centers are designed to hold large events, such as conferences, conventions, and trade shows. Public buildings, person and large buildings are too broad and do not provide any additional information to suggest that Joe is specifically in a convention center. A box is not likely to be a suitable location for a large gathering of people. Answer is
--target-- convention center

Options: A: mountains,B: dead body,C: pay debts,D: state park,E: new york, Knowledge: The sentence implies that John could not scatter his wife's remains in the wilderness because he needed to delay due to paying debts. This suggests that John may have been struggling financially and was unable to travel to the location where he wanted to scatter his wife's remains. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- pay debts

Hospitals, motels, and offices are typically located on larger properties and do not have as much foot traffic on sidewalks, while corners may have some foot traffic but are not a common location for trash cans. Answer is
--target-- park
--input-- Question: The family wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons, what did they abhor? Options: A: orphan,B: biological child,C: give away,D: foster child,E: abandon, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the family wanted to adopt a child for reasons related to the environment or ethical concerns. The word "abhor" suggests that they strongly dislike or disapprove of something, which in this case is likely the act of abandoning a child. Therefore, the correct answer is "abandon," as the other options do not relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- abandon
--input-- Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? Options: A: stall,B: start melting,C: taxi,D: crash,E: speed up, Knowledge: If an airplane's engines cut off and cannot be restarted in flight, the plane will lose its thrust and begin to descend rapidly. Without power, the pilot is unable to control the plane's speed or altitude. This often results in a crash or forced landing. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of losing engine power in flight. Answer is
--target-- crash
--input-- Question: Where would you be concerned about finding a cavity? Options: A: solid object,B: molar,C: dentist,D: unbrushed tooth,E: teeth, Knowledge: A cavity is a type of dental decay, usually caused by bacteria that produce acid which erodes tooth enamel. Molars are the teeth located towards the back of the mouth, which are used for grinding and chewing food. They have more surface area and deeper grooves, which makes them more prone to developing cavities. The other options in the choices do not relate specifically to teeth or dental health, except for the dentist option, which is more related to preventative care rather than the location of a potential cavity. Answer is
--target-- molar
--input-- Question: Human beings learn about current events from what print item? Options: A: question authority,B: melt,C: read newspapers,D: act,E: dictionary, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the print item in question is a source of information about current events.

--input-- Question: In what kind of environment does an anemone live? Options: A: nursery,B: south pacific,C: desert,D: sea water,E: atlantic ocean, Knowledge: Anemones are aquatic creatures that typically live in the sea, so the correct answer would be related to a water environment. The options "nursery," "desert," and "south pacific" do not have any clear connection to sea life, so they can be eliminated. The remaining options are "sea water" and "Atlantic Ocean." While an anemone could potentially live in the Atlantic Ocean, the more general answer of "sea water" is a better fit since anemones can be found in various bodies of saltwater across the world. Answer is
--target-- sea water
--input-- Question: He wanted lodging in the actual what, so that he was already where he needed to be? Options: A: a yurt,B: resort area,C: big city,D: michigan,E: going on vacation, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for lodging in a specific location in order to be close to where they need to be. The options ‘yurt’, ‘resort area’, and ‘going on vacation’ do not fit the criteria of being a specific place that the person needs to be in. ‘Michigan’ is a geographic location and not a specific destination, so it also does not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, ‘big city’ is the best answer as cities are typically associated with specific places and activities, making it the most likely option for the person to want to be close to where they need to be. Answer is
--target-- big city
--input-- Question: If I am suffering from boredom, and I want to see something beautiful, what should I do? Options: A: see art,B: see ghost,C: watch film,D: grocery shop,E: do crossword puzzle, Knowledge: The question is asking for a suggestion for something beautiful to alleviate boredom. Seeing art is a common suggestion for people looking for beauty, as art can be visually stunning and emotionally evocative. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to beauty or may not be feasible options for someone looking for a quick distraction from boredom (e.g. grocery shopping or doing a crossword puzzle). Additionally, seeing a ghost may not be considered beautiful by everyone. Answer is
--target-- see art
--input-- Question: The goal was to hit the target, but a projectile ball can't hit anything if it isn't in what? Options: A: motion,B: ocean,C: flintlock,D: arcade,E: tennis court, Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order for a projectile ball to hit a target, it needs to be in motion, as it cannot hit anything otherwise. This is a basic principle of physics, as an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. The other options, such as the ocean or a flintlock, have no clear connection to the sentence and do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- motion
--input-- Question: Where is a good place to set a cup of coffee while relaxing? Options: A: coffee shop,B: kitchen,C: hand,D: table,E: office, Knowledge: The question is asking for a place to set a cup of coffee, implying that it needs a flat surface. A table is a common surface for placing drinks while relaxing, and it is also mentioned in contrast to the other options (coffee shop, kitchen, hand, office), which would not necessarily have a table or suitable surfaces to place a cup of coffee. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: If a fried egg was runny and there was no toast to sop it up, after the meal there'd be a messy what? Options: A: henhouse,B: garden,C: plate,D: supermarket,E: bird's nest, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the egg was not fully cooked and there was no toast to absorb the runny yolk. This would result in a messy plate that would need to be cleaned after the meal. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not relate to eggs or food waste. Answer is
--target-- plate
--input-- Question: If I want to behave with proper aplomb, what manners should I avoid? Options: A: inappropriate,B: incomplete,C: impolite,D: none,E: incorrect, Knowledge: The word "aplomb" means self-confidence or assuredness, particularly in social situations. If someone is behaving with proper aplomb, they are likely exhibiting good manners and social grace. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a behavior that goes against these socially acceptable norms, such as being impolite. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to manners or social behavior. Answer is
--target-- impolite

Options: A: swimming pool,B: rich person's house,C: country club,D: fitness center,E: park, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys playing squash as a form of warm-up before lifting weights. It also implies that the squash court is located within a facility that the person has access to. The term "country club" is commonly associated with private recreational facilities that offer amenities such as squash courts, swimming pools, fitness centers, and other recreational activities. The other options do not have a clear association with the context of the sentence, except for "fitness center," which may also have squash courts. Answer is
--target-- country club
--input-- Question: What will happen to animals after eating food? Options: A: bite,B: digestion,C: feel pleasure,D: pass water,E: listen to each other, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the focus is on what happens to animals after they eat food.

--input-- Question: If I wanted to grow plants, where could I put a lot of dirt? Options: A: corner,B: street,C: closet,D: garden,E: bathtub, Knowledge: A garden is a common place for growing plants, and it typically involves using a lot of soil or dirt to create a suitable environment for the plants to grow.

--target-- garden
--input-- Question: What does a person often feel about someone judging them guilty? Options: A: controversy,B: responsibility,C: resentment,D: judge feelings,E: hurt feelings, Knowledge: The wording of the question suggests that someone is being judged guilty, and the question asks about how that person feels about it. From this, we can infer that the person being judged may feel negatively about the experience. The word "resentment" suggests a feeling of bitterness or indignation towards the one doing the judging, which would be a common reaction to being judged guilty. The other options do not accurately capture the emotions that one might feel in this situation. Answer is
--target-- resentment
--input-- Question: A town between two mountains is located in a what? Options: A: valley,B: hospital,C: state,D: train station,E: michigan, Knowledge: The description of a town being located between two mountains suggests that it is situated in a valley, which is the low-lying area between two hills or mountains. A hospital or train station may also be located in a valley, but the sentence specifically mentions two mountains, which indicates a geological feature rather than a man-made structure. The mention of Michigan or any other state seems irrelevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- valley

Where might he have gone? Options: A: motel room,B: apartment,C: bathroom,D: games,E: house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James had to pay a high price for using a toilet, which is unlikely to be the case for a typical public bathroom or one in a regular residence. Motel rooms are often associated with a paid option for a private bathroom, making it the most likely choice for James. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- motel room
--input-- Question: Why did the heavy metal band need electricity at the stadium? Options: A: concert,B: bedroom,C: make person sick,D: building,E: church, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the heavy metal band was performing at a stadium, which is a large venue suitable for concerts. Because heavy metal music typically requires high volume and a lot of energy, it is likely that they needed electricity to power their instruments and amplifiers in order to provide a good performance for the audience. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- concert
--input-- Question: What is a person looking for when completing puzzles or riddles? Options: A: avoid pain,B: compliments,C: intellectual challenge,D: passing grade,E: attention, Knowledge: Puzzles and riddles are typically associated with providing an intellectual challenge. They often require the solver to use their problem-solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking abilities to arrive at a solution. Avoiding pain, seeking compliments, or obtaining a passing grade are not motivations commonly associated with completing puzzles or riddles. Attention-seeking may be a motivation for some individuals, but it is not a definitive answer given the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- intellectual challenge
--input-- Question: If someone was making breakfast, they'd probably put two slices of bread in the what? Options: A: plastic bag,B: pantry,C: supermarket,D: toaster,E: prison, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is making breakfast and the context hints at them making toast. To make toast, two slices of bread are typically placed in a toaster, which is an appliance designed to brown bread by heating it with electricity. The other options do not have any clear connection to making toast. Answer is
--target-- toaster

Options: A: boredom,B: nice home,C: michigan,D: feeling satisfied,E: house clean, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the person is doing housework, which is an activity done to clean and organize a living space. The options "boredom," "Michigan," and "nice home" are not related to the context of the sentence and can be ruled out. The option "feeling satisfied" is a plausible choice, but the most direct and literal answer is "house clean." Answer is
--target-- house clean
--input-- Question: Where would a corpse be covered by a blanket? Options: A: bath store,B: bedroom,C: hospital,D: flower garden,E: michigan, Knowledge: The context suggests that a corpse is being referred to, which implies that the question is related to death and funerals. Hospitals are a place where people often pass away and where bodies are kept before being moved to other locations. It is common practice for hospitals to cover bodies with a sheet or blanket out of respect for the deceased, which is why this option is the most likely answer. The other choices have no clear relevance to the context provided. Answer is
--target-- hospital
--input-- Question: The man  tried to break the glass in order to make his escape in time, but he could not.  The person in the cat, trying to kill him, did what? Options: A: accelerate,B: putting together,C: working,D: construct,E: train, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in the car was trying to kill the man, and they were in pursuit. The fact that the man was trying to break the glass in order to escape also implies that the car was closing in on him quickly. Therefore, the correct answer is "accelerate," as this option best reflects the action the person in the car would have taken to try and catch the man. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- accelerate
--input-- Question: The trucker plopped on the bench with a sense of relief, where did he arrive? Options: A: bordello,B: rest area,C: garden,D: bus stop,E: state park, Knowledge: The verb "plopped" suggests that the trucker arrived at a place where he was able to relax, indicating a rest area is a more likely option than a bordello or bus stop. Additionally, a garden or state park may be pleasant locations for relaxation, but a rest area is the most common place for a trucker to take a break on a long drive. Answer is
--target-- rest area
--input-- Question: What is part of a republic like the USA? Options: A: state,B: democratic,C: kingdom,D: democracy,E: dictatorship, Knowledge: The question is asking for a characteristic or element that is shared between the USA and a republic. The USA is a federal republic, which means that it consists of a central government and individual states that have their own governing powers. Therefore, "state" is the correct answer. "Democratic" is a political term that can describe both republics and other forms of government, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. "Kingdom," "democracy," and "dictatorship" are all forms of government that are different from a republic, making them incorrect choices. Answer is
--target-- state
--input-- Question: Where do you keep extra clothing on a hike? Options: A: person,B: hamper,C: closet,D: upstairs,E: backpack, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is hiking, which means they are likely traveling on foot and need to carry their belongings with them. The other options (person, hamper, closet, upstairs) suggest stationary locations that are not practical for carrying extra clothing on a hike. A backpack is a common item used for carrying supplies on a hike, making it the logical choice for storing extra clothing. Answer is
--target-- backpack

Options: A: new hampshire,B: bloom,C: washington state,D: sunshine,E: spontaneously combust, Knowledge: Apple trees are known for producing flowers, which eventually develop into apples.

Options: A: fish market,B: shallow waters,C: atlantic ocean,D: fresh water,E: shore line, Knowledge: The question suggests that the location of the crab is in a very cold area in the east, which implies it is found in the Atlantic Ocean as it is the body of water located to the east of North America. The other options, such as fish market, shallow waters, fresh water, and shore line do not fit this description of a cold area in the east where a crab could be found. Answer is
--target-- atlantic ocean
--input-- Question: The chef wanted to perfect his craft, what did he do? Options: A: thin potatos,B: prepare food,C: study french cooking,D: drink,E: cook dinner, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the chef is looking to improve his skills, and studying French cooking is often considered one of the best ways to do so.

Options: A: one choice for pet,B: cute,C: kennel,D: soft,E: waxy, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person only got a puppy instead of a kitten and a puppy because they only wanted one pet. The phrase "one choice for pet" matches the meaning conveyed by the sentence, while the other options do not relate to the context or offer an explanation as to why only a puppy was chosen. Answer is
--target-- one choice for pet
--input-- Question: There was no shade for Jenny.  She was forced to lie there exposed to what? Options: A: full sunlight,B: bright sunshine,C: sunny place,D: eat cake,E: direct sunlight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jenny did not have any protection from the sun, which likely means she was exposed to direct sunlight. Options like "full sunlight," "bright sunshine," and "sunny place" can all be used to describe sunny environments, but they do not convey the lack of shade that is being described in this sentence. "Eat cake" is a completely unrelated option. Answer is
--target-- direct sunlight
--input-- Question: What could happen to you after you are cleaning house for a long time? Options: A: neatness,B: tiredness,C: order,D: exhaustion,E: sneezing, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cleaning the house for a long time can lead to a negative physical state. The word "after" implies that something may happen as a result of the activity. The options "neatness," "order," and "sneezing" do not make sense in this context as they are not negative outcomes of cleaning. "Tiredness" is a possibility, but "exhaustion" implies a more extreme level of fatigue and is a better answer option. Answer is
--target-- exhaustion

Options: A: rumpspringa,B: meeting new people,C: having fun,D: meet new people,E: plan, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is organizing when to go to a party, which is an act of planning. The other options do not relate to the idea of organizing or scheduling an event. "Rumpspringa" refers to a period of adolescence in some Amish communities, "meeting new people" and "having fun" are not specific enough to describe the action of scheduling, and "meet new people" is not a grammatically correct phrase on its own. Answer is
--target-- plan
--input-- Question: What kind of path do comets tend to have? Options: A: ice,B: set orbits,C: universe,D: space,E: solid nucleus, Knowledge: Comets are celestial objects that orbit around the sun. Unlike planets, which have relatively circular orbits, comets tend to have highly elliptical orbits. These orbits are often described as "set orbits" because they are determined by the gravitational forces of the sun and other objects in the solar system. Comets are composed of an icy nucleus and a trail of gas and dust, which is why "ice" is also a plausible answer. However, the question specifically asks about the path of comets, not their composition. "Universe" and "space" are both too vague to be correct answers, and "solid nucleus" is incorrect because it only describes one part of a comet, not its path. Answer is
--target-- set orbits
--input-- Question: What do people feel after having sex that requires them to shower? Options: A: bedroom,B: pleasant,C: obesity,D: painful,E: dirty, Knowledge: The sentence implies that after having sex, people may feel dirty and need to shower.

Options: A: euthanasia,B: pass water,C: die of cancer,D: feel pain,E: feel pleasure, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tumors found by the vet were malignant, which means they are cancerous. Cancer is a serious disease that can spread to other parts of the body, causing pain and discomfort for the affected animal.

The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not address the seriousness of the situation. Answer is

--input-- Question: What is the thing that is agitated in your head when kissing? Options: A: sexual stimulation,B: herpes,C: headache,D: catch cold,E: happiness, Knowledge: Kissing is commonly associated with romantic and sexual intimacy. The option "sexual stimulation" is the most logical answer since it refers to the physical arousal and excitement that can result from kissing. The other options, such as herpes, headache, and catching a cold, are negative associations that are not directly related to the act of kissing. "Happiness" could also be a possible answer, but it is less specific to the physical sensation described in the question. Answer is
--target-- sexual stimulation

Options: A: trash,B: floor,C: subway,D: ground,E: lawn, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy got rid of the newspaper once he arrived at his destination. The most common place to dispose of a newspaper is in the trash, making "trash" the most likely answer. "Floor," "subway," "ground," and "lawn" are all unlikely options as they suggest that Billy left the newspaper in a public place rather than disposing of it properly. Answer is
--target-- trash
--input-- Question: Where do you keep a pail in your house?

--input-- Question: what is printed with ink and distributed daily? Options: A: fountain pen,B: squid,C: newspaper,D: book,E: printer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item is printed with ink and distributed daily. Fountain pens and printers are tools used for printing or writing, but they do not necessarily produce something that is distributed daily. Squid is a sea animal that has nothing to do with printing. Books may be printed with ink, but they are not necessarily distributed daily, whereas newspapers are. Therefore, the correct answer is newspaper. Answer is
--target-- newspaper
--input-- Question: What are people likely to do when an unexpected decent outcome occurs? Options: A: kill each other,B: thank god,C: experience pain,D: hatred,E: talk to each other, Knowledge: The phrase "unexpected decent outcome" suggests that something positive and unexpected has happened. In many cultures, it is common for people to express gratitude or give thanks when something positive happens. The phrase "kill each other" and "hatred" have negative connotations and would not be appropriate in response to a positive outcome. "Experience pain" is also unlikely to be a common response to an unexpected decent outcome. "Talk to each other" is a general response that could be appropriate in a variety of situations, but it doesn't specifically address the idea of a positive outcome. Answer is
--target-- thank god

--target-- packaging materials

Options: A: timing,B: expenditure of time,C: getting bored,D: anger,E: patience, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was rewarded for waiting politely for dessert, which implies that the child demonstrated patience. Patience refers to the ability to wait calmly and without complaint, which would be the appropriate behavior in this context.

Options: A: principal,B: birth,C: loving couple,D: act of sex,E: parents, Knowledge: The word "caretakers" suggests that the answer is someone responsible for taking care of a child. "Principal" refers to the head of a school, "birth" refers to the process of giving birth, "loving couple" could refer to any two people in a romantic relationship, and "act of sex" is not a term used to describe those responsible for taking care of a child. "Parents" is the only option that specifically refers to those who have responsibility for the care and upbringing of a child. Answer is
--target-- parents
--input-- Question: Where would you run in to a niece you only see every one and a while? Options: A: family reunion,B: brother's house,C: family picture book,D: family tree,E: party, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the niece is not seen often, which indicates that the occasion would be a larger family gathering. A family reunion would be the most likely option for such an event, where extended family members come together after long periods of time. The other options, such as a brother's house or party, do not necessarily guarantee the presence of extended family members. Meanwhile, a family picture book and family tree are not physical places where one can run into someone. Answer is
--target-- family reunion

The other answer options do not relate directly to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- energy

Headaches are a common symptom, often caused by dehydration or changes in blood flow to the brain.

Shock and get up do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- headache

Options: A: desk drawer,B: cabinet,C: purse,D: classroom,E: pocket, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student needed to easily access their writing instrument while walking, which implies that it needed to be stored in a portable location. The options "desk drawer," "cabinet," and "classroom" are stationary locations and do not make sense in the context of walking. "Purse" is a possibility, but the sentence does not mention anything about the student carrying a purse. Therefore, the most likely place for the student to store their writing instrument would be in their pocket. Answer is
--target-- pocket

Options: A: building,B: crowd,C: city,D: group,E: high school, Knowledge: An auditorium is a type of building that is designed to accommodate large groups of people for a variety of events, including plays, concerts, and lectures.

Options: A: grocery store,B: diaper bag,C: gas station,D: liquor store,E: medicine cabinet, Knowledge: The context clues in the sentence suggest that the bottles being referred to are likely alcoholic beverages, as they are located behind a cashier.

Options: A: canada,B: atlas,C: united states,D: major cities,E: book, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person or people had to consult a source to know where to go before getting on the national highway. An atlas is a collection of maps that can help with navigation and finding locations, making it a likely choice for consulting.

Options: A: sing a song,B: neatness,C: allergies,D: healthy living,E: using water, Knowledge: The question asks about something needed for cleaning, and one of the options is "using water." This is a likely correct answer because water is commonly used as a cleaning agent for many different surfaces and materials. The other options, such as "sing a song" or "neatness," do not seem related to cleaning. "Allergies" and "healthy living" might be tangentially related to cleaning (e.g. using hypoallergenic cleaning products), but neither is as directly relevant as using water. Answer is
--target-- using water

Options: A: phlegm,B: saliva nd mouth,C: disease,D: germs,E: spittle, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is spitting excessively without realizing it, which suggests that there may be a problem with their saliva production or the condition of their mouth.

Options: A: frustration,B: delays,C: being annoyed,D: moving forward,E: progress, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally is waiting in a line that is moving very slowly, which can be a frustrating experience. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Delays" is too general and doesn't reflect how Sally is feeling, while "being annoyed" is too similar to frustration to be a distinct option. "Moving forward" and "progress" are both more positive options that don't reflect Sally's potential negative feelings about the slow-moving queue. Answer is
--target-- frustration

The other options, such as euphoria or happiness, are not physical sensations that can be pressed against someone, while fatigue would not be associated with dancing. Answer is
--target-- rhythmic movement

Options: A: subdivision,B: newspaper,C: street,D: laundry mat,E: surface of earth, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the house in question has a subscription to a service that delivers something to their driveway every morning. The only choice that fits this context is "newspaper," as many people receive a daily newspaper subscription that is delivered to their driveway.

--input-- Question: Who is the guard here for? Options: A: man post,B: attack,C: intimidation,D: prisoner,E: unprotected, Knowledge: The word "guard" implies that someone or something is being protected or watched over. In this case, the most likely candidate for being guarded would be a prisoner, as prisons rely heavily on the presence of guards to keep inmates secure. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Man post" and "unprotected" imply a lack of protection or defense, which would not require a guard. "Attack" and "intimidation" suggest a more aggressive role than simply guarding, which does not fit the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- prisoner

The most logical place to keep a letter opener would be on a desk, where it can be easily accessed when needed. The other options do not provide a suitable location for storing a letter opener. An office supply store or stationery store would sell letter openers but keeping it there would not be practical. A martyr's chest refers to a medieval chest used to store relics or artifacts and a refrigerator is not a suitable place for storing a letter opener. Answer is
--target-- desk

Options: A: brothel,B: restaurant,C: building,D: bowling alley,E: at hotel, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny needed a place to stay in town and the only available option was expensive and had a mismatch between the carpet and drapes. This description is commonly associated with hotels, as they are known for having various styles and decor options in their rooms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: What do people need to do to change their lives? Options: A: face problems,B: better themselves,C: pay bills,D: become disillusioned,E: eat chicken, Knowledge: The question is asking about how people can improve or transform their lives, which strongly suggests that the correct answer will be a positive action that individuals can take. "Better themselves" fits this description, as it implies that people can work to become better versions of themselves through self-improvement, education, personal growth, or other means. The other options are less relevant or appropriate: facing problems and becoming disillusioned are negative experiences that may not lead to positive change, paying bills is a necessary but mundane task, and eating chicken is not related to life transformation.

Options: A: underpass,B: homes,C: workplace,D: school,E: space shuttle, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that shelter is necessary for survival, and the options presented refer to different possible locations where humans might find shelter. "Homes" is the most likely answer, as it's the most common and typical location for people to find shelter. "Underpass" could potentially be a location for homeless individuals, but it's not a typical answer for where people find shelter. "Workplace" and "school" are places people often go during the day, but they are not typically used as long-term shelters. "Space shuttle" is an unlikely answer as it only applies to astronauts and is not a typical location for shelter. Answer is
--target-- homes
--input-- Question: Someone who had a very bad flight might be given a trip in this to make up for it? Options: A: first class,B: propitious,C: reputable,D: one,E: sufficient, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone had a bad experience during a flight and may be offered something to make up for it. "First class" is a type of seating class that is associated with luxury and comfort. It is possible that an airline may offer a complimentary first-class ticket as a way to apologize for a bad experience during a previous flight. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- first class
--input-- Question: Nature can be good and bad for the person who walks, what are some things? Options: A: seeing bear,B: see beautiful views,C: get wet,D: getting lost,E: murdered by a landshark, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that nature can have both positive and negative effects on a person who walks in it. Seeing a bear is potentially dangerous and frightening, while seeing beautiful views can be enjoyable and awe-inspiring. Getting wet can be uncomfortable, especially if the person is not prepared with proper clothing or gear. Getting lost can be stressful and possibly dangerous, as the person may not be able to find their way back to civilization. The last option, "murdered by a landshark," is not a realistic or plausible outcome in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- seeing bear, get wet, getting lost
--input-- Question: Jim decided to lose weight.  He thought that exercise is the best way to lose weight because you can't get rid of what? Options: A: need for food,B: fitness,C: sweating,D: fastfood,E: thirst, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim believes exercise is the best way to lose weight, possibly because it helps control his appetite. The phrase "you can't get rid of" implies that the thing being referenced is an inherent part of the weight loss process. Fitness and sweating may help with weight loss, but they are not directly related to appetite control. Fast food and thirst are also unrelated to the sentence's context. Answer is
--target-- need for food
--input-- Question: Nature creates more beautiful structures than those that are what? Options: A: artificial,B: indoors,C: city,D: man made,E: eat cake, Knowledge: The sentence implies that nature's structures are more beautiful than some other types of structures. The word "artificial" means something that is made by humans, as opposed to natural. Therefore, it is the most logical choice as a contrast to nature's structures. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not contrast with nature's structures. Answer is
--target-- artificial
--input-- Question: The water in clouds turn in to what when it gets cold? Options: A: typhoon,B: snowflake,C: laddle,D: teardrops,E: sink, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that water in clouds transforms into something else when it gets cold. The most common transformation that occurs when water is exposed to cold temperatures is that it freezes and becomes snow. Typhoons are large, tropical storms that form in warm waters, so they are not related to the cold temperatures mentioned in the question. Laddle is a tool used for scooping liquids or substances, so it does not relate to the context of the sentence. Teardrops are related to emotions and crying, so they are not related to the scientific process of water freezing. Sink is an object that goes underwater, so it is not related to the context of the sentence either. Answer is
--target-- snowflake

Options: A: snoring,B: latency,C: dreams,D: relaxation,E: dreaming, Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to the body when going to sleep. While snoring and dreaming may occur during sleep, they are not indicative of what happens to the body as a whole. Latency refers to the time it takes to fall asleep and is not a physical change in the body. Dreaming is a separate process from the initial act of falling asleep. Relaxation, on the other hand, is a common physiological change that occurs as the body prepares to rest. This includes a drop in heart rate, breathing rate, and muscle tension, as well as a decrease in brain activity. Answer is
--target-- relaxation

Options: A: banana tree,B: sailor suit,C: theatre,D: mulberry bush,E: research laboratory, Knowledge: Monkeys are known to be arboreal (tree-dwelling) animals and are also known to eat bananas.

--target-- banana tree
--input-- Question: What is a form of anaerobic exercising? Options: A: shortness of breath,B: lift weights,C: error,D: fall down,E: run, Knowledge: The question is asking for a form of anaerobic exercise, which refers to high intensity, short duration activities that require the body to use energy without oxygen. Lifting weights is a common form of anaerobic exercise because it involves using a high amount of force for a short period of time, which requires the body to break down glucose without oxygen. The other options do not relate to anaerobic exercise and do not require the use of energy without oxygen. Answer is
--target-- lift weights
--input-- Question: The earth is one planet in what? Options: A: tree,B: orbit,C: solar system,D: fotograph,E: dreams, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the earth is part of something else, and the options "tree", "fotograph", and "dreams" do not make sense in this context. "Orbit" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and does not provide enough information. However, the term "solar system" refers to the sun and all the objects that are bound to it by gravity, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Therefore, "solar system" is the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- solar system
--input-- Question: Where would you put a container can after you buy it?

--input-- Question: Where did you meet your best friend since Kindergarten? Options: A: friend's house,B: school,C: fraternity house,D: internet cafe,E: airplane, Knowledge: The question specifies that the best friend has been known since Kindergarten.

--target-- school
--input-- Question: James was below the balloon.  He watched it rise.  What direction did he look in? Options: A: upstairs,B: aloft,C: diagonal,D: upstream,E: upwards, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that James watched the balloon rise, which suggests that he was looking in the direction of the balloon. The word "upwards" specifically refers to a direction that is higher or above, which is the direction that the balloon would be moving in as it rose. The other options do not relate to a direction that is higher or above. Answer is
--target-- upwards
--input-- Question: John and Tim like playing. It makes them what? Options: A: feeling happy,B: learning,C: injury,D: burn,E: get hungry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Tim enjoy playing, which implies that it brings them joy and happiness. The phrase "feeling happy" specifically relates to emotions, which is an appropriate response to the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in this context. "Learning" does not match the sentence structure, "injury" and "burn" are negative outcomes that would not make John and Tim happy, and "get hungry" is unrelated to the topic of playing. Answer is
--target-- feeling happy
--input-- Question: What could happen if someone is seeing new presents at a birthday party? Options: A: envy,B: jealousy,C: education,D: fear,E: excitement, Knowledge: The context of a birthday party and the mention of "new presents" suggest that the emotion being described is likely positive, rather than negative. Envy and jealousy involve negative feelings towards others, and fear wouldn't typically be associated with seeing presents at a party. Education also doesn't fit the context. Excitement, on the other hand, is a natural response to receiving or seeing new presents at a celebration, making it the most appropriate answer choice. Answer is
--target-- excitement
--input-- Question: Joe's cat smelled something delicious and jumped into this, causing him to panic and fear for its life. Where might it have jumped? Options: A: meat loaf,B: bedroom,C: microwave,D: living room,E: floor, Knowledge: The sentence describes Joe's reaction to his cat jumping into something, causing him to panic and fear for its life. The mention of the word "delicious" suggests that the cat smelled food, and the unusual level of panic indicates that the cat jumped into a dangerous place. The option "microwave" is the only one that fits the criteria of both being a place where food can be heated and a potential danger to a cat, as being inside a running microwave can be fatal to animals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- microwave
--input-- Question: Why would a person put flowers in a room with dirty gym socks? Options: A: continue to grow,B: plant themselves,C: many colors,D: smell good,E: make pretty, Knowledge: The question implies a contrast between the unpleasant smell of dirty gym socks and the pleasant smell of flowers. The option "smell good" directly addresses this contrast and provides a logical reason for why someone would put flowers in a room with dirty gym socks. The other options do not adequately address the contrast in the question. Answer is
--target-- smell good
--input-- Question: The table wasn't level.  some parts were higher and some were lower with no rhyme or reason.   It was very what? Options: A: electrical circuit,B: build evenly,C: uneven,D: unbalanced,E: tilted, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the table was not level and that some parts were higher and some were lower with no rhyme or reason. The word "uneven" specifically describes this situation, making it the correct choice. "Build evenly" suggests that the table was intentionally made that way, which is not the case in this sentence. "Unbalanced" and "tilted" could be correct in other contexts, but do not fully capture the idea expressed here. "Electrical circuit" does not relate to the context of the sentence at all. Answer is
--target-- uneven

Options: A: happiness,B: problems,C: prosecution,D: distress,E: misery, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James knew that murder was wrong, but still considered doing it because he thought he could get away with it. This implies that he was aware of the legal consequences of murder and the possibility of being prosecuted for it. Therefore, he was fearful and troubled by the prospect of facing prosecution for his actions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- prosecution
--input-- Question: How can someone die from eating hamburger? Options: A: gas,B: getting full,C: mad cow disease,D: death,E: feel full, Knowledge: Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a neurological disorder found in cattle that can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated beef products.

--input-- Question: Where would using a boat not require navigation skills? Options: A: water,B: ocean,C: garage,D: harbor,E: river, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using a boat without requiring navigation skills is possible in a specific location. Water, ocean, harbor, and river are all bodies of water that would require navigation skills to operate a boat safely. A garage, on the other hand, is not a body of water and therefore would not require navigation skills to operate a boat. Answer is
--target-- garage
--input-- Question: What does a self assured person often do? Options: A: acknowledgment,B: focused,C: know what time,D: feel important,E: trust himself, Knowledge: The phrase "self assured" suggests that the person has confidence and belief in themselves, which is often associated with trusting one's own abilities and decisions. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the phrase. "Acknowledgment" and "feel important" are unrelated to the personal qualities of a self assured person, while "focused" and "know what time" are too specific and do not capture the broader characteristic being described. Answer is
--target-- trust himself
--input-- Question: He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what? Options: A: scary,B: having friends,C: good feeling,D: conflict,E: friendship, Knowledge: The sentence is suggesting that the person being described had no trouble making friends and did not find it to be a difficult or challenging experience. The use of the word "personal" implies that it is something that is typically associated with individual feelings or emotions. Therefore, the only option that makes sense in this context is "conflict," as it suggests that the individual did not have any personal conflicts or issues when it came to making friends. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- conflict
--input-- Question: What do you feel when giving assistance to the needy? Options: A: reward,B: boredom,C: pleasure,D: happiness,E: satisfaction, Knowledge: The question is asking about the emotions that one experiences when giving assistance to the needy. The answer is subjective, but the word "feel" suggests an emotional response rather than a logical or physical one. The choices all offer emotions that are commonly associated with helping others, but "satisfaction" is the most appropriate answer as it describes a feeling of fulfillment or accomplishment that comes from helping others in need. The other options, such as "boredom" or "happiness," do not fit with the context of helping the needy. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: Paul wants carrots and doesn't need to drive anywhere. He gets them from where? Options: A: refrigerator,B: store,C: farmer's market,D: supermarket,E: dryer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Paul already has the carrots he wants, and he doesn't have to go anywhere to get them. This indicates that the carrots are likely already in his possession, and the most logical place for them to be is in his refrigerator. The other options, such as the store or farmer's market, suggest that Paul would need to go somewhere to acquire the carrots. The dryer option is clearly an absurd and incorrect choice as it is used for drying clothes, not storing vegetables. Answer is
--target-- refrigerator
--input-- Question: He was a sloppy eater, so where did he leave a mess? Options: A: sailboat,B: desk,C: closet,D: table,E: apartment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is messy while eating, implying that they leave crumbs or spills behind.

--target-- table
--input-- Question: What does every person want? Options: A: life partner,B: larger house,C: second chances,D: money,E: headache, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about something that every person wants, which indicates it is something universally desired. Life partner is a common desire for many people as human beings are social animals and crave companionship. Money is also a common desire as it provides financial security and the ability to afford basic necessities and luxuries. Larger house and second chances are subjective desires that not everyone may want or need. Headache is not a desire but rather an unwanted physical condition. Answer is
--target-- life partner or money

Options: A: bird's nest,B: park,C: guitar,D: kite,E: quark, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the flying animal is picking up a string, which is a common material used by birds to build their nests. Birds use a variety of materials, including twigs, grass, and string, to construct their nests and raise their young.

--target-- bird's nest

--target-- confidence
--input-- Question: What could go to a tennis court? Options: A: desert,B: college campus,C: recreational center,D: athletic club,E: park, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer should be a location where a tennis court might be found. While it's possible to have a tennis court in a park or a recreational center, an athletic club is more likely to have a tennis court as part of their facilities. A college campus might have a tennis court as well, but it's not as common as an athletic club. The option "desert" doesn't make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- athletic club

Options: A: sand box,B: kitchen cabinet,C: waterfall,D: water fountain,E: table, Knowledge: The question is asking for an object that can be used to fill a cup and then drink from it. Sand box, kitchen cabinet, and table do not have any mechanism for providing water. A waterfall may be too strong to fill a cup and may not be safe for consumption.

Options: A: formal seating,B: friend's house,C: movies,D: home,E: apartment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the two people played video games all night in a living room, which may indicate that they were in someone else's home. The word "visited" implies that the subject enjoyed going somewhere, and the context of the sentence suggests that the person's enjoyment was related to the activity they were doing, which was playing video games. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: The weasel ran up away from danger, somebody joked only our first president could get him down from the what? Options: A: washington dc,B: ladder,C: natural history museum,D: cherry tree,E: chicken coop, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel has scurried up to a high place to avoid danger, and that someone made a joke connecting the situation to the first president. The most likely connection is the apocryphal story about George Washington chopping down a cherry tree and then telling the truth about it, in which he is said to have climbed a ladder to reach the tree. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- ladder
--input-- Question: If you were looking for a blowfish, you wouldn't look on dry land, you'd look in a what? Options: A: fish market,B: jungle,C: sea water,D: body of water,E: soup, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the blowfish is an aquatic animal, which means it would only be found in water. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A fish market might sell blowfish, but the sentence is not referring to buying one. The jungle is a land-based environment and is unlikely to have an aquatic animal like a blowfish. Sea water is a possibility, but it is too broad of a term without more context, whereas body of water is more specific and implies a lake, river, or ocean. Soup is not a location and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- body of water
--input-- Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what? Options: A: jet engine,B: helicopter,C: electric motor,D: rotator,E: electrical circuit, Knowledge: The sentence states that the rotor of the Apache helicopter is not powered by internal combustion, indicating that another power source is being used. The options "jet engine" and "electrical circuit" do not seem to make sense in the context of a helicopter rotor. "Rotator" is not a known power source and is not commonly used to refer to a type of engine. Therefore, the most logical option is "electric motor." Answer is
--target-- electric motor

Options: A: players,B: play games,C: casino,D: table,E: toy store, Knowledge: In poker, the dealer spreads the community cards (including the flop) face up on the table in the center of the players, so that everyone at the table can see them.

--target-- table
--input-- Question: Where is a salt shaker most often kept? Options: A: cruet,B: table setting,C: kitchen cupboard,D: cabinet,E: store, Knowledge: Salt shakers are typically found on table settings during meals, as they are used to add salt to food. The other options may be places where salt shakers are stored, but they are not commonly found in those locations during meal times. A cruet is a container for oil or vinegar, a kitchen cupboard or cabinet is used for storage, and a store is a place of purchase. Answer is
--target-- table setting
--input-- Question: Where would you put a dollar if you want to go to a store and buy something with it? Options: A: cash drawer,B: teh bank,C: safety deposit box,D: pocket,E: piggy bank, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person wants to use the dollar to purchase something immediately, which suggests that they need to have the dollar readily accessible. The most common place for people to store money that they plan on using in the short term is their pocket. The other options, such as a cash drawer or safety deposit box, are not practical for immediate use, and a piggy bank is typically used for saving money, rather than spending it. While a bank may be a valid option for obtaining cash to use later, the question specifically asks where to put the dollar, rather than where to obtain additional funds. Answer is
--target-- pocket

--target-- dining room
--input-- Question: What is unlikely to get bugs on its windshield due to bugs' inability to reach it when it is moving? Options: A: airplane,B: scooter,C: motorboat,D: car,E: motor vehicle, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is a vehicle that moves high above the ground or water, since bugs are unable to reach it. An airplane fits this description, as it typically flies at high altitudes. The other options either move closer to the ground or have a structure (such as a windshield) that would allow bugs to reach them. Answer is
--target-- airplane
--input-- Question: What mall store sells jeans for a decent price? Options: A: clothing store,B: bedroom,C: thrift store,D: apartment,E: gap, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the store in question sells jeans for a decent price. The term "mall store" narrows down the options to stores that are typically found in shopping malls. The option "clothing store" is too general, as most mall stores sell clothing. The options "bedroom" and "apartment" are not stores at all. The option "thrift store" may sell inexpensive clothing, but it is less likely to carry new jeans from popular brands. The option "Gap" is a well-known clothing store that specializes in jeans and is often found in malls, making it the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- Gap
--input-- Question: Where can a bath towel be borrowed? Options: A: cupboard,B: at hotel,C: swimming pool,D: clothes line,E: backpack, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location where a bath towel can be borrowed is a place where people may need to use one temporarily.

--target-- at hotel

Options: A: no problems,B: better themselves,C: face problems,D: learn from each other,E: become disillusioned, Knowledge: The word "disillusioned" suggests a sense of disappointment or loss of hope, which could explain why someone might stop caring about their own problems. If they have faced numerous challenges and setbacks without seeing any improvement, they may become disheartened and lose motivation to keep trying. The other options do not necessarily imply a loss of interest in one's own problems. Answer is
--target-- become disillusioned

Options: A: mountain,B: fancy,C: sandplain,D: cliff,E: gorge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was riding on a flat, open area until he reached the ocean. A sandplain is a flat or gently sloping area covered in sand, which would fit the description provided in the sentence. The other options, such as a mountain, fancy, cliff, or gorge, all describe features that have significant elevation changes, which would make it unlikely that John could ride a plain over them all the way to the ocean. Answer is
--target-- sandplain
--input-- Question: They were never going to be big actors, but they all had passion for the local what? Options: A: theater,B: opera,C: show,D: television,E: blockbuster feature, Knowledge: The sentence states that the individuals in question were not going to be "big actors," suggesting that they were likely involved in a smaller, more local theater scene. The word "passion" also implies a strong emotional connection to the activity, further reinforcing the idea that they were involved in something they loved. The other options, such as opera, television or blockbuster feature, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- theater

Options: A: beach,B: city hall,C: closet,D: garage,E: school, Knowledge: Folding chairs are commonly used in outdoor settings where seating options are limited, such as at beaches, parks, or outdoor events. However, they are not typically stored in these locations, as they are often rented or brought specifically for the occasion.

--target-- beach
--input-- Question: If you spend a long time shopping in uncomfortable shoes, you might develop what? Options: A: tiredness,B: calluses,C: bankruptcy,D: standing in line,E: sleepyness, Knowledge: The sentence implies that wearing uncomfortable shoes for a long period of time can have a negative impact on the feet. Calluses are thickened, hardened skin that develops as a protective response to pressure and friction on the skin. Therefore, it is the most likely consequence of spending a long time shopping in uncomfortable shoes. The other options, such as tiredness or sleepiness, may be related to the physical strain of standing for a long time, but they do not specifically relate to the feet. Bankruptcy and standing in line are not related to the physical consequences of wearing uncomfortable shoes. Answer is
--target-- calluses
--input-- Question: What does impeachment mean for the president? Options: A: vote,B: election,C: trouble,D: board room,E: corporation, Knowledge: The term "impeachment" is commonly used in a political context to refer to the removal of a government official, such as a president, from office due to illegal or unethical behavior.

The other options do not accurately describe the meaning of impeachment. Answer is
--target-- trouble

Options: A: loser,B: ignoble,C: peasant,D: inferior,E: plebeian, Knowledge: The context suggests that the sentence is discussing the beliefs of a noble citizen in the Roman empire towards those born with lower social status. The term "inferior" implies that the noble citizen considered themselves to be of a higher social status than those with a lower status. "Loser" and "ignoble" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of discussing beliefs towards lower social status. "Peasant" and "plebeian" may refer to lower social classes in Rome but do not necessarily convey the idea of inferiority. Answer is
--target-- inferior

--target-- pain

--input-- Question: How does someone go about buying beer? Options: A: have no money,B: pants,C: relaxation,D: lose money,E: spend money, Knowledge: Buying beer generally involves exchanging money for the product, so "spend money" is the most appropriate answer. The other choices are not relevant to the context of buying beer. "Have no money" would prevent someone from buying beer, "pants" and "relaxation" are not related to buying beer, and "lose money" implies that the person is not intentionally trying to buy beer, but is losing money in some other way.

Options: A: know everything,B: acknowledgment,C: make more money,D: throw a party,E: spare time, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unable to pay their bills, indicating a financial struggle. Therefore, the best solution would be to increase their income by making more money.

Options: A: losing weight,B: healthy,C: get in shape,D: weight loss,E: sweat, Knowledge: The question is asking about the main benefit of exercising, which suggests that there may be multiple benefits but one outweighs the others.

While losing weight and getting in shape are commonly associated with exercising, they are more specific benefits that may not be applicable to everyone. The option "sweat" is not a benefit of exercising but rather a side effect of physical exertion. Answer is
--target-- healthy

Options: A: no go,B: unable,C: unlikely,D: impossibility,E: cant do, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Steve had some doubts about the possibility of something, but ultimately agreed that it was a certain way. The word "possible" indicates that there was some chance of the thing happening, but Steve's agreement suggests that it was not very likely. The word "unlikely" fits best with this context.

Options: A: california,B: tokio,C: downtown,D: narnia,E: large town, Knowledge: The question refers to a specific area of a west coast city, indicating that the answer will be a specific location within that city. The mention of a Japanese restaurant suggests that the answer will be a neighborhood with a significant Japanese community, and the word "region" implies a specific area within the city.

The other options, such as jungle (where animals typically live free in the wild), kill (which does not make sense in the context of the sentence), india (which is a location but not related to the sentence), and eat cake (which is a joke answer) do not fit the context of the sentence.

Additionally, the phrase "supposed to" implies that the soldier was given a specific purpose for going to the rendezvous point, and that purpose is likely to be fulfilled by waiting for further instructions rather than immediately engaging in combat. The other answer choices may be plausible in other contexts, but they do not fit the specific language used in this sentence. Answer is

This is a common characteristic of subdivisions, which are planned communities consisting of similar homes and landscaping. The other options, such as a city or parking garage, do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not typically have uniform yards or landscaping. The option "three feet" does not make sense in relation to the question. Michigan may have subdivisions, but the sentence does not provide any specific information about the location the speaker is looking for. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where can a student learn to play a triangle? Options: A: math class,B: math book,C: in pythagorus' band,D: orchestra,E: music class, Knowledge: Playing a triangle is a musical skill, so the correct answer must relate to music. Math class and math book are not relevant, as they don't involve music. Pythagoras was a famous mathematician, not a musician, so being in his band is not a plausible scenario. Orchestra is a close option, but it may not necessarily include learning how to play a triangle specifically. Therefore, music class is the most appropriate choice, as it would likely cover a broad range of musical skills, including playing percussion instruments like the triangle. Answer is
--target-- music class

This is typically done by sanding the wood with sandpaper until the roughness has been removed. Petrifying wood means turning it into stone, which is not relevant in this context. Warping wood means twisting or bending it out of shape, which is not a solution to make the wood smooth. Composting wood means turning it into organic matter, which is not relevant in this context. Cleaning wood may remove surface dirt, but it will not make the wood smooth to the touch. Answer is

--target-- indian

Options: A: boredom,B: happiness,C: transportation cost,D: getting there,E: road rage, Knowledge: The scenario presented involves another driver making a careless maneuver while the subject is driving to work. This suggests a potential conflict or dangerous situation on the road, which may elicit a strong emotional response from the subject. "Road rage" is a commonly used term to describe intense anger or frustration experienced while driving, often in response to perceived reckless or aggressive behavior by other drivers.

--input-- Question: What kind of food makes someone sick? Options: A: boat,B: necessary to live,C: edible,D: unhealthy,E: kitchen, Knowledge: The question refers to food that can cause sickness, which implies that the correct answer must be something that is harmful to consume. None of the other options have any clear association with causing illness. "Boat" and "kitchen" are objects and "necessary to live" and "edible" describe characteristics that do not necessarily indicate if a food is harmful or not. "Unhealthy" directly suggests that a type of food is not good for one's health and can cause sickness. Answer is
--target-- unhealthy
--input-- Question: Where would you find the sharpest parts of a triangle? Options: A: three vertices,B: point,C: 3 sides,D: three sides,E: math book, Knowledge: The vertices of a triangle are the points where the three sides meet. Therefore, the sharpest parts of the triangle (the points with the smallest angle measurement) would be located at the three vertices. The point, on the other hand, refers to a single location in space and does not necessarily have any connection to the shape of a triangle. The math book is not a relevant option, as it does not relate to the concept being discussed. The options "3 sides" and "three sides" are essentially the same, but the use of the numeral "3" is more appropriate in this context. Answer is
--target-- three vertices

Options: A: exit ramp,B: garage,C: driveway,D: repair shop,E: stop light, Knowledge: Freeways are typically designed with exit ramps that allow vehicles to safely leave the high-speed traffic and merge onto local roads or highways. Garages, driveways, and repair shops are not typically located next to freeways and would not provide direct access onto the road. Stop lights are more commonly found on local roads and would not be used to exit a freeway. The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to navigation and transportation on a roadway. Answer is
--target-- exit ramp
--input-- Question: What does going to bed with your spouse for sex lead to? Options: A: bad dreams,B: a good nights sleep,C: rest,D: sleepiness,E: get pregnant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that going to bed with your spouse for sex leads to a particular outcome, and the most likely option is a good night's sleep. This is because sex is often associated with physical exertion and relaxation, which makes it easier to fall asleep afterwards. The other options are unlikely to be the outcome of having sex with one's spouse, as they do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Answer is

Options: A: park,B: show,C: auditorium,D: movies,E: rest area, Knowledge: The word "seats" suggests that the event is performed in a venue where one needs to buy a ticket to be assigned a specific place to sit.

The options "auditorium" and "show" are more likely to have assigned seating and require tickets for entry. "Show" specifically refers to a performance or entertainment event, while "auditorium" can be used for various events, but often refers to a performance space. Answer is

Options: A: mall,B: business,C: store,D: sale,E: sell goods, Knowledge: The phrase "high-traffic space" implies that the merchant wanted to rent a space that would receive a lot of foot traffic. A mall is a location where many people go to shop, making it a high-traffic location for businesses.

Options: A: writing,B: universe,C: outer space,D: outerspace,E: orbit, Knowledge: The question asks how a planet moves around the sun, and the term "orbit" specifically refers to the path that a planet takes as it revolves around a star.

Options: A: falling down,B: trip,C: fall down,D: move around,E: celebrate, Knowledge: The sentence presents two different ways of approaching dance - one is elegant and specific, while the other is more focused on having fun. The correct answer is an option that aligns with the idea of having fun without any negative consequences.

Options: A: feelings of guilt,B: prison sentence,C: terrible,D: encouragement,E: die, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that killing people is a heinous crime that would result in a severe punishment. The only option that aligns with this context is "prison sentence." "Feelings of guilt" might be a natural consequence of such an action, but it is not a legal consequence. "Terrible" and "die" are not appropriate outcomes for the crime of murder. "Encouragement" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: If someone laughs after surprising them they have a good sense of what? Options: A: joy,B: fight,C: frightened,D: humor,E: laughter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person who laughs after being surprised has a good sense of something, and the context of the sentence indicates that it is related to the act of laughing. This is further supported by the options "joy" and "laughter," which are also related to the act of laughing. However, the option "humor" is the best fit as it directly relates to the situation described in the sentence.

Options: A: town,B: beach,C: park,D: near,E: outside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people were playing games in a specific location and that location was similar to something else. The options "town", "beach", and "near" don't really fit because they don't describe a specific type of location. "Outside" is too vague and doesn't describe a specific place. "Park" is the best option because it is a specific type of location where people often play games, making it the closest thing to the soccer field where the games were being played. Answer is

Options: A: big house,B: train,C: cabin,D: living room,E: home, Knowledge: A fireplace is a common feature in a living room, which is often the central gathering place in a home. A big house or cabin may have multiple fireplaces throughout, but the living room is a typical location for a fireplace.

--target-- living room
--input-- Question: If you own a cat where is the last place you'd want to find it? Options: A: trouble,B: dog's mouth,C: backyard,D: nature,E: home, Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer is related to a danger or risk associated with cats. Cats and dogs are often seen as natural enemies, and it is not uncommon for dogs to attack or even kill cats. Therefore, finding your cat in a dog's mouth would be the worst possible scenario for a cat owner. The other options, such as trouble, backyard, nature, or home, do not necessarily imply a danger to the cat. Answer is
--target-- dog's mouth
--input-- Question: Where would you find a kosher deli along side a number of different places to eat? Options: A: los angeles,B: food court,C: new york city,D: jewish community,E: jewish neighborhoods, Knowledge: The term "kosher" refers to food that is prepared according to Jewish dietary laws, which suggests that the deli is likely located in a place with a significant Jewish population. Of the choices given, only New York City and Jewish neighborhoods specifically mention Jewish communities, making them the most likely options. However, the fact that the sentence mentions "a number of different places to eat" suggests that the deli is located in a more general area with multiple food options, which makes New York City the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- new york city
--input-- Question: What do you do when you're going to market? Options: A: buy food,B: see other people,C: buying vegetables,D: buy a fat pig,E: traveling, Knowledge: The phrase "going to market" traditionally refers to a trip to a local market to purchase goods, typically food. The phrase "buying vegetables" is the most specific and relevant choice to this context, as it is a common item people purchase at markets. "Buy food" and "buy a fat pig" are also possible choices, but they are more general and do not specifically indicate a trip to the market. "See other people" and "traveling" are unlikely choices because they do not connect to the context of purchasing goods at a market. Answer is
--target-- buying vegetables
--input-- Question: She feared that she had cancer, but upon discovering truth that she hadn't, what was her attitude toward life? Options: A: conclusion,B: pain,C: happiness,D: relief,E: boring, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person was worried about having cancer but was eventually reassured that they did not have it. Therefore, it is likely that they would feel relieved and grateful for this news, rather than feeling bored or concluding something else. Pain may have been a potential outcome if they had developed cancer, but that is not the case in this sentence. Happiness could be a possible emotional response, but given the situation, relief is the more appropriate choice. Answer is
--target-- relief

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A conference room or card room would not be relevant in this situation, while placing a net or moving to a neighbor's house would not solve the problem. Answer is
--target-- rug

Options: A: wipe out,B: enjoy yourself,C: start fighting,D: get wet,E: drown, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is not skilled at surfing, which means he is likely to fall off his board or wipe out.

Options: A: front door,B: turn lock,C: solution to problem,D: install,E: open doors, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Sarah gave her brother a "guy", which is likely a typo or a misspelling of "key".

The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence or are too general to apply specifically to the situation described. Answer is
--target-- turn lock
--input-- Question: When did mammoth's live? Options: A: boscage,B: forest,C: prehistory,D: prehistoric times,E: ancient times, Knowledge: The term "mammoth" refers to a group of extinct elephant-like mammals that lived during the prehistoric period. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to periods in the past, such as "prehistoric times" or "ancient times."

--target-- prehistoric times
--input-- Question: After killing people, the murderer went to church after feeling what? Options: A: murder,B: remorse,C: religious,D: retaliation,E: anguish, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the murderer felt a sense of guilt or regret after committing the act of murder, which is often referred to as remorse. This feeling may have led them to seek solace or forgiveness in a religious setting such as a church. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as retaliation would imply the murderer felt one had wronged them, religious would suggest that they went to church for reasons unrelated to their crime, and anguish wouldn't explain why they went to church. Answer is
--target-- remorse
--input-- Question: What might result in an unsuccessful suicide attempt? Options: A: die,B: interruption,C: bleed,D: hatred,E: dying, Knowledge: An unsuccessful suicide attempt means that the person did not succeed in taking their own life. Interruption could refer to someone or something stopping the person in the middle of the attempt, such as someone discovering them or a sudden change of heart. Bleeding could happen as a result of the attempt, but does not necessarily mean the attempt was unsuccessful. The options "die" and "dying" are not appropriate answers as they would refer to a successful attempt, while "hatred" is not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- interruption
--input-- Question: What can happen if you are buying products that someone else does not want you to buy? Options: A: joy,B: disagreements,C: agony,D: pleasure,E: owning, Knowledge: The question suggests that there may be some conflict or negative outcome associated with buying products that someone else does not want you to buy.

The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- disagreements
--input-- Question: The child was getting many gifts for his birthday, his father reminded him to do what after opening each one? Options: A: show appreciation,B: asking for,C: exchanging,D: say thank,E: smile, Knowledge: The father's reminder after each gift suggests that the child needs to do something that shows gratitude towards the gift-giver.

--target-- show appreciation

Options: A: rest area,B: desert,C: state park,D: fairgrounds,E: soccer game, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob is surrounded by trees and nature, which is a characteristic commonly associated with state parks.

Options: A: circus,B: in kentucky,C: western movie,D: central park,E: state fair, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Bart entered his horse into a contest, which is typically held at events such as fairs or shows. Of the given options, the state fair is the most likely location for such a contest. The other options, such as a circus or a western movie, do not typically hold horse contests. In Kentucky, there are many horse competitions, but the sentence does not provide any indication that Bart entered his horse in a specific competition in Kentucky. Central Park is in New York City and would not be a typical location for a horse contest. Answer is
--target-- state fair
--input-- Question: From where does a snowflake form? Options: A: cloud,B: snow storm,C: billow,D: air,E: snowstorm, Knowledge: Snowflakes form in clouds when water vapor freezes onto tiny particles, such as dust, that are floating in the air. This process is known as nucleation. As more and more water vapor freezes onto the particle, it builds up into a crystal, which eventually falls to the ground as a snowflake. The other choices may be related to snow, but they do not accurately describe the formation process of a snowflake. Answer is
--target-- cloud
--input-- Question: All the power tools like the drill used for fixing cars made for a very loud workplace where? Options: A: basement,B: work shop,C: tool shed,D: repair shop,E: store room, Knowledge: The sentence mentions power tools and fixing cars, which suggests that the location is likely a place where vehicles are repaired. The term "workplace" also suggests that this is a professional environment, rather than a personal one (such as a basement or tool shed). The most appropriate location from the given options is a repair shop, where mechanics would use power tools like drills to fix cars. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- repair shop

Options: A: working hard,B: frustration,C: rejection,D: defeat,E: stress, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that applying for a job can have a negative emotional impact, even if the person gets the job. The word "even" implies that getting the job does not necessarily eliminate the negative emotion. Stress is a common emotion associated with job applications because of the pressure of the job search process and the potential impact it can have on an individual's future. The other options do not have the same association with job applications and are less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- stress
--input-- Question: A farmer sees a weasel in the woods, where is the farmer? Options: A: chicken coop,B: beach,C: fairytale,D: great outdoors,E: corn fields, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the farmer sees a weasel in the woods, which suggests that the setting is outside in a natural environment. Of the given choices, "great outdoors" is the only option that matches this description. The other options (chicken coop, beach, fairytale, corn fields) do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- great outdoors
--input-- Question: He picked up the perfect pebble, he planned to skip it across the entire small what? Options: A: manual,B: lake,C: aquarium,D: pond,E: playground, Knowledge: Skipping stones is a common activity done on bodies of water, particularly shallow ones like ponds. A lake and an aquarium are unlikely choices, as they are either too big or too small for this activity. A manual refers to a collection of instructions or a guidebook, while a playground is not typically associated with skipping stones. Answer is
--target-- pond
--input-- Question: Traveling from new place to new place is likely to be what? Options: A: going somewhere,B: exhilarating,C: diarrhea,D: relocation,E: exhausting, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of traveling from one new place to another is being described. The word "likely" implies that the answer choice reflects a common experience associated with this type of travel.

The other options do not reflect common experiences associated with this type of travel. Answer is
--target-- exhausting

Options: A: middle east,B: oven,C: balkan peninsula,D: provide meat,E: asia minor, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Turkey has a small area in the north that is part of a larger region or area. The Balkan Peninsula is a well-known geographic region in southeastern Europe, and Turkey does indeed have a small section of land in the northern Balkans (Thrace). The other options (middle east, oven, provide meat, Asia Minor) have no clear connection to the geography of Turkey described in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- balkan peninsula
--input-- Question: Where might someone store a reusable shopping bag? Options: A: supermarket,B: home,C: mart,D: obesity,E: closet, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the person is looking for a place to store a reusable shopping bag, indicating that they likely own one and want to keep it easily accessible for future use. The most logical place to store a personal item like this would be in one's own home. The other options - supermarket, mart, obesity, and closet - do not make sense in the context of the question as they are not places where one would typically store their own personal belongings. Answer is
--target-- home
--input-- Question: How could you have fun by yourself with no one around you? Options: A: fairgrounds,B: watching television,C: tired,D: enjoyable,E: friend's house, Knowledge: The question is asking for an activity that can be done alone and still be enjoyable. The options "fairgrounds" and "friend's house" suggest social activities, which wouldn't meet the criteria of being alone. "Watching television" may be an option for some, but it doesn't necessarily imply having fun. "Tired" is not an activity or something that can bring enjoyment. "Enjoyable" is the most appropriate option as it suggests an activity that can be done alone and enjoyed. Answer is
--target-- enjoyable
--input-- Question: The potato might be the official vegetable of what? Options: A: vegans,B: kitchen cupboard,C: restaurants,D: chicken,E: maryland, Knowledge: This question requires some external knowledge, as there is no clear context given in the sentence. One way to approach it would be to think about famous agriculture or food products associated with different states or regions. In this case, Maryland is known for its prominent role in the history of the potato industry, with the state's Eastern Shore being a major producer of seed potatoes. Therefore, it is likely that the potato is considered to be the official vegetable of Maryland. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- Maryland
--input-- Question: Where is the sky most beautiful? Options: A: planetarium,B: outdoors,C: atmosphere,D: night,E: photo, Knowledge: The question is asking about the location where the sky is most beautiful, which implies a physical setting. The planetarium and photo options may show beautiful skies, but they are not actual locations. The atmosphere is too broad of a term to be a specific location, and night could refer to any outdoor location where the sky is visible. Therefore, the correct answer is outdoors, as this refers to the physical setting where people can experience the beauty of the sky firsthand. Answer is
--target-- outdoors
--input-- Question: What type of fruit is easily broken in to sections? Options: A: slide,B: citrus,C: band,D: orchestra,E: coconut, Knowledge: Citrus fruits, such as oranges, tangerines, and grapefruits, are commonly known for being easily segmented into sections.

--target-- citrus
--input-- Question: Marathoners feel fatigued after running twenty six miles, but some that have pushed them self too hard might be prone to what? Options: A: excruciating pain,B: passing out,C: death,D: drunk,E: exhaustion, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that marathon runners who push themselves too hard may experience something more severe than just fatigue after running 26 miles. Although all of the choices may be possible outcomes of overexertion, passing out is commonly associated with pushing oneself too hard during exercise. Marathon runners may experience decreased blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting or passing out. The other options are not likely to occur in this context. Answer is
--target-- passing out

--input-- Question: I am cold, what should I do to stay warm? Options: A: stay in bed,B: light fire,C: freezer,D: lay on ice,E: spit, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is feeling cold and needs to find a way to warm up. Staying in bed can help as it allows the body to generate and retain heat. The other options are unlikely to help the person warm up, and some (like laying on ice or spitting) may actually make them colder. Lighting a fire may help, but it may not be practical or feasible in all situations. Answer is
--target-- stay in bed
--input-- Question: Copulating with the wrong partner may be ill advised, many diseases can be transferred that can cause different types of what? Options: A: intense pleasure,B: ejaculation,C: period of rest,D: enjoyment,E: skin irritation, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that copulating with the wrong partner can lead to the transfer of diseases that can cause different types of negative outcomes.

The other choices are not related to the context of the sentence and would not make logical sense. Answer is
--target-- skin irritation
--input-- Question: What do audiences clap for? Options: A: cinema,B: theatre,C: movies,D: show,E: hockey game, Knowledge: Clapping is a common way for audiences to show their appreciation for a performance. While cinema, movies, and show can refer to forms of entertainment that are performed live, they are not typically associated with clapping as a form of audience feedback. Hockey games may involve applause, but it is not the primary reason that people attend them. Theatre, on the other hand, is a traditional and well-known form of live entertainment that often involves applause as a way to show appreciation for actors and performers. Answer is
--target-- theatre
--input-- Question: Where would you get a balalaika if you do not have one? Options: A: orchestra,B: music store,C: buy music,D: make music,E: symphony, Knowledge: The question is asking where you would obtain a balalaika, suggesting that it is an instrument rather than a music-related item. The options "orchestra," "buy music," and "symphony" do not make sense in the context of obtaining an instrument, while "make music" implies creating your own balalaika from scratch rather than obtaining one. This leaves "music store," which is a common place to purchase musical instruments. Answer is
--target-- music store
--input-- Question: Hoping for a beautiful day, what did the clouds do that disappointed everyone? Options: A: homely,B: overcast,C: hideous,D: overrated,E: misshapen, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that everyone was hoping for a beautiful day, but something happened with the clouds that disappointed them. "Overcast" is the only choice that directly relates to clouds and can cause disappointment since it means the sky is covered in clouds, making it less likely for the sun to come out and for bright blue skies to be visible. The other choices, such as "homely" or "misshapen," do not have anything to do with clouds or weather. Answer is
--target-- overcast
--input-- Question: What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike? Options: A: reasonable,B: more money,C: not go to work,D: return to work,E: union, Knowledge: The question suggests that the unions are currently on strike and need to make demands in order to end the strike. From the context, it can be inferred that the demands need to be reasonable in order to be accepted by the employer and to ultimately bring an end to the strike. The other options do not make sense within the context of the question, such as "not go to work" which would not be a demand that unions would make since they are already not working due to the strike. Answer is
--target-- reasonable
--input-- Question: The landscaper was carefully arching stones together, he was creating an elaborate what over the creek? Options: A: park,B: made from rocks,C: balloon,D: field,E: bridge, Knowledge: The sentence describes the landscaper working with stones to create a structure over a creek, which strongly suggests that the landscaper is building a bridge. The other options - park, field, and balloon - are unlikely choices for something that involves carefully placing stones, while "made from rocks" is too vague to be a clear choice. Answer is
--target-- bridge
--input-- Question: John was not happy with his marriage. He and his wife drifted apart.     All and all, recent turns could be described as what? Options: A: inappropriate,B: sadness,C: unsatisfied,D: unfortunate,E: disenchanted, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's marriage is not going well, and he and his wife have grown apart. This indicates that recent turns in their relationship have been negative, which aligns with the option "unfortunate." The other options do not accurately describe the situation. "Inappropriate" and "unsatisfied" are too vague and do not provide enough context to be correct. "Sadness" is an emotion and not a description of recent events, and "disenchanted" implies that John was once enchanted with his marriage, which is not indicated in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- unfortunate
--input-- Question: The poor girls needed a light to see, what was the relationship between that light and finishing her homework? Options: A: darkness,B: cumbersome,C: obesity,D: forceful,E: crucial, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the girls needed the light in order to do their homework, which suggests that the light was an important element for their task. The word "crucial" means essential or vital, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other answer choices do not have any clear connection to the relationship between the light and finishing homework. Answer is
--target-- crucial
--input-- Question: Where would you find a ticket booth and see a concert? Options: A: clerk,B: indoors,C: movie theater,D: venue,E: auditorium, Knowledge: A ticket booth is typically located at the entrance of a venue or performance space, such as a concert hall or theater. The other options, such as clerk or movie theater, do not necessarily suggest a concert or performance, and while concerts can be held indoors or in an auditorium, those terms are not specific enough to indicate a ticket booth and a concert together. Answer is
--target-- venue
--input-- Question: Who is not famous for a superhighway with no speed limit? Options: A: europe,B: germany,C: industrialized country,D: city,E: america, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone or someplace is famous for a superhighway with no speed limit. Europe, Germany, and industrialized countries are too broad and do not specifically refer to a superhighway with no speed limit. America has some famous highways but no superhighway with no speed limit. Therefore, the correct answer must be city. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: The low trickle of water revealed a stone, where was the stone found? Options: A: ocean,B: gallbladder,C: driveway,D: river bed,E: creek bed, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the stone was found in a location where there is a low trickle of water. The options "ocean" and "gallbladder" do not make sense in this context, as the former is a large body of water and the latter is an organ in the human body. While a stone could potentially be found in a driveway, it is less likely to be discovered through a low trickle of water. "River bed" is a possible answer, but the use of the word "trickle" implies a smaller body of water, making "creek bed" the most likely option. Answer is
--target-- creek bed
--input-- Question: Where is the closest place from where you could borrow salt? Options: A: ocean water,B: table,C: shaker,D: neighbor's house,E: lake, Knowledge: The question implies that the person asking needs salt and is looking for a place to borrow it from. The options "ocean water," "table," and "lake" are not plausible sources of salt. "Shaker" may contain salt, but it is not clear whose shaker is being referred to. "Neighbor's house" is the most logical option, as borrowing from a neighbor is a common practice and a likely source of salt. Answer is
--target-- neighbor's house
--input-- Question: No matter what date you put on it, we all know the universe to be what? Options: A: very old,B: infiniverse,C: getting younger,D: infinite,E: real, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the universe is something that has existed for a long time, regardless of what date is assigned to it. The term "very old" implies that the universe has been around for a significant amount of time, which is consistent with scientific estimates that put the age of the universe at around 13.8 billion years. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "infiniverse" and "infinite" imply that the universe is infinite in size, while "getting younger" contradicts the scientific understanding that the universe is actually expanding and becoming older. "Real" is not a logical alternative. Answer is
--target-- very old
--input-- Question: A meteor travels through galaxies which are a part of what? Options: A: republic of ireland,B: sky,C: orbit,D: universe,E: school, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the meteor travels through galaxies, which are a part of something larger. The only option that refers to a larger structure is "universe." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - the Republic of Ireland is a country, the sky is a part of Earth's atmosphere, orbit refers to the path of an object around another object, and school is a place where students learn. Answer is
--target-- universe
--input-- Question: What is a person considered a bully known for? Options: A: ridiculous,B: false information,C: made fun of,D: brain tumor,E: bull rider, Knowledge: The word "bully" is used to describe someone who intimidates or mistreats others, often through physical or emotional abuse.

Answer is
--target-- made fun of

Options: A: see particular program,B: see exhibits,C: see people play game,D: have conversation,E: watch film, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman has an interest in the man, which implies that she wants to interact with him in some way. The most appropriate option among the given choices is "have conversation," as it is a common way of getting to know someone better. The other options may involve some form of entertainment or observation, but they do not necessarily imply a personal interaction or connection between two people. Answer is
--target-- have conversation

--input-- Question: When cooking sheep meat a lot of people might want to be well? Options: A: ram,B: lamb,C: done,D: ram,E: wolf, Knowledge: The sentence implies that when cooking sheep meat, it is important for it to be cooked well. The options "ram" and "wolf" are not relevant to the context since they are not related to cooking or preparing sheep meat. "Lamb" is a type of sheep that is commonly consumed, but it does not give any indication of how it should be cooked. Therefore, "done" is the correct answer as it relates to the cooking process and the desired outcome of well-cooked meat. Answer is
--target-- done

Options: A: aeroport,B: church,C: furniture store,D: university,E: living room, Knowledge: Pursuing an advanced degree usually requires attending a university, where classes and coursework are conducted in a formal academic setting. While it's possible to study at home in a living room or in a quiet corner of a furniture store, it wouldn't be the norm for most students. Airport terminals and churches are typically not associated with academic pursuits, making them unlikely options for where you would sit while working on an advanced degree. Answer is
--target-- university
--input-- Question: Farm land makes use of what? Options: A: countryside,B: michigan,C: north dakota,D: farming areas,E: illinois, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer is something related to the use of land for farming. The options "countryside," "michigan," "north dakota," and "illinois" may all have farming areas within them, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question. "Farming areas," on the other hand, directly relates to the use of land for agriculture, making it the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- farming areas
--input-- Question: A good interview after applying for a job may cause you to feel what? Options: A: offer,B: income,C: rejection,D: hostile,E: hope, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a good interview after applying for a job can cause a particular feeling. Among the choices given, "hope" is the only emotion that may result from a positive interview experience. "Offer" and "income" are outcomes of a successful interview, but they are not emotions. "Rejection" and "hostile" are negative emotions that do not align with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- hope
--input-- Question: Computers have allowed everybody to answer questions they have quickly, but still we seem to be getting duller despite access to this what? Options: A: economic boom,B: advance knowledge,C: produce sound,D: teach,E: follow instructions, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite having access to computers, which allow people to find answers to their questions quickly, people are becoming duller. This suggests that the computers are not necessarily improving people's knowledge or cognitive abilities. The answer choice "advance knowledge" is the best fit, as it implies that computers should be helping people learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. The other answer choices do not fit as well, as they do not have a clear connection to the idea of computers and knowledge. Answer is
--target-- advance knowledge

Options: A: mountains,B: countryside,C: train,D: painting,E: village, Knowledge: The contextual clues suggest that the cottage is located in a remote, isolated area with no other structures nearby. This is typically associated with the countryside, where individual homes are often spread out and surrounded by natural landscapes. The other options, such as mountains or a train, do not fit the description of the setting provided in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: Where is knight always portrayed as a hero? Options: A: middle ages,B: chess board,C: kids story,D: fairy tale,E: castle, Knowledge: Fairy tales often feature knights as brave and noble heroes who go on quests to save princesses or defeat evil sorcerers, which is why they are typically portrayed in a positive light. While knights also existed in the Middle Ages and were associated with castles, this does not necessarily mean they were always seen as heroes. Chess boards also feature knights, but they are simply game pieces and not associated with any specific heroic qualities. Kid's stories could refer to a variety of different genres and contexts, so it is not clear whether knights would always be portrayed as heroes in this case. Answer is
--target-- fairy tale
--input-- Question: James is carrying a duffel bag with him because he doesn't have a vehicle of his own and needs a bag to carry his things in while he uses what? Options: A: library,B: transit,C: bus station,D: army barracks,E: locker room, Knowledge: The sentence states that James doesn't have his own vehicle, which implies that he is using some form of public transportation. The most logical option among the choices provided is transit, which includes buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation. The other options, such as the library or locker room, do not require carrying a duffel bag and therefore would not be a likely reason for James to have it with him. The army barracks could be a possibility, but it is less likely given that the sentence does not suggest James is a member of the military. Answer is
--target-- transit
--input-- Question: What would you need if you want to smoke? Options: A: you're stupid,B: kill yourself,C: roll joint,D: cigarette,E: lighter fluid., Knowledge: The question is asking for the necessary item to smoke, and a cigarette is a common item used for smoking. The other answer choices are inappropriate and offensive, and do not relate to the question. Lighter fluid is used to start fires and is not needed for smoking. Roll joint is a reference to smoking marijuana, which is not specified or implied in the question. Answer is
--target-- cigarette
--input-- Question: James decided that competing was the right choice.   Not competing has a defined outcome, but if he competes then what could happen? Options: A: might win,B: perform better,C: enemies,D: winners and losers,E: lose, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James made the decision to compete, which implies that there is a possibility of winning. The option "perform better" is too vague and does not provide a clear outcome of competing. "Enemies" does not logically follow from the information presented, and "winners and losers" simply restates the concept of competition without providing a specific outcome for James. "Lose" is a possible outcome, but the sentence implies that James chose to take a risk by competing, suggesting that there is a potential for reward as well. Answer is
--target-- might win
--input-- Question: What could you use to get to some airplanes? Options: A: taxi,B: carry people,C: car,D: stall,E: crash, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a means of transportation that can take a person to airplanes.

--target-- taxi
--input-- Question: What happens when driving? Options: A: lack of fuel,B: paint scratching,C: wheels turning,D: tire wear,E: traffic accident, Knowledge: The question asks about what happens when driving, and all of the choices could technically happen while driving. However, the context of the question suggests that the answer should be the most negative consequence that could occur while driving. While the other options may be inconvenient or annoying, a traffic accident is the most serious and potentially dangerous outcome of driving. Answer is
--target-- traffic accident
--input-- Question: What are our bodies doing after having food? Options: A: falling down,B: digesting,C: gas,D: weight gain,E: not hungry, Knowledge: When we eat food, our body breaks it down into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used for energy, growth, and repair. This process is called digestion, which involves the work of various organs such as the stomach, liver, pancreas, and intestines. Weight gain may occur if we eat more calories than we burn, but it's not the primary process that occurs after having food. Falling down and gas are not related to the process of digestion. Not feeling hungry may be a result of satiety or fullness, which can occur after digestion is complete. Answer is
--target-- digesting
--input-- Question: Why would one try to avoid work? Options: A: making money,B: leave home,C: success,D: malaise,E: bad mood, Knowledge: The word "avoid" suggests that there is a negative association with work, which could be due to a feeling of malaise or general unease. Making money, leaving home, and success are typically positive outcomes of work, so they are unlikely to be reasons for avoiding it. Bad mood is also too vague and could be caused by a variety of factors, whereas malaise specifically refers to a feeling of physical or emotional discomfort or unease. Answer is
--target-- malaise
--input-- Question: What do you do in order to fly in airplane? Options: A: buy tickets,B: passenger,C: read,D: add gas,E: run through checklists, Knowledge: When traveling by airplane, it is necessary to purchase tickets in order to board the plane. The other options are not directly related to the act of flying in an airplane. Being a passenger is a result of purchasing a ticket, reading is not essential to flying, adding gas is the responsibility of the airline staff, and running through checklists is done by the pilots and crew, not the passengers. Answer is
--target-- buy tickets

Options: A: fair,B: basket,C: dog hair,D: game,E: sun, Knowledge: The question is asking for another name for a color that is light in shade. "Fair" is a commonly used word to describe a light complexion or hair color, and this fits the context of the question. The other options do not provide a clear connection to the question, as "basket" and "game" are not colors and "dog hair" is too generic. "Sun" may suggest a yellowish hue, but it does not clearly indicate a light shade. Answer is
--target-- fair
--input-- Question: Sally was bored because she didn't like the junk that was on what? Options: A: drawer,B: garage,C: caddy,D: bed,E: television, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something was in a drawer that Sally did not like and it made her bored.

--input-- Question: The lion sensed his competitor was timid, so what attitude did the lion take? Options: A: reckless,B: bellicose,C: defensive,D: aggressive,E: dauntless, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lion perceived its competitor as being timid, which would have given the lion an advantage in a fight. In order to assert its dominance and intimidate its competitor, the lion would likely have taken an aggressive approach. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - reckless suggests a lack of strategy, bellicose suggests a willingness to fight regardless of the situation, defensive suggests a fear of being attacked, and dauntless suggests fearlessness rather than aggression. Answer is
--target-- aggressive
--input-- Question: John felt a snake slither over him as he rested.  He was afraid to raise his covers for fear of startling it.  Where might he be? Options: A: pet shops,B: oklahoma,C: basement,D: bedroom,E: dreams, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is in bed, resting and afraid to disturb a snake that is slithering over him. The most likely location for this scenario to take place is in a bedroom, which is typically where people sleep and where a bed would be located. The other options (pet shops, Oklahoma, basement, dreams) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: Where can you find a place to eat in an urban area close to local nightlife? Options: A: city,B: downtown,C: mall,D: shopping center,E: own house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is in an urban area with nearby nightlife, which is commonly associated with downtown areas in cities. Downtown areas often have a variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance, making it an ideal location for finding a place to eat close to local nightlife. The other options, such as malls and shopping centers, may have food options but are less likely to have a vibrant nightlife scene. Answer is
--target-- downtown
--input-- Question: You have to a lot of thinking while studying a new subject, but it is how you gain what? Options: A: fatigue,B: depression,C: best way,D: weight,E: knowledge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that studying a new subject requires a lot of thinking, which can be a mentally challenging process. However, this process is necessary in order to gain something, which indicates that the answer is likely to be a positive outcome. The word "knowledge" directly aligns with this idea, as it represents the ultimate goal of studying and learning. The other options, such as fatigue and depression, do not align with the idea of gaining something positive from studying, while "best way" is too vague and "weight" does not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- knowledge
--input-- Question: How will you communicate if you are far away from who you want to communicate with? Options: A: think,B: talk with people,C: talk to people,D: speak out,E: send email, Knowledge: The other options in the choices involve speaking or vocal communication, which would not be effective if the person you want to communicate with is far away. Sending an email is a common form of written communication that can be sent instantly to someone across a distance. Answer is
--target-- send email
--input-- Question: Why would you not trust your friends after chatting with friends? Options: A: fever,B: smoke,C: laughing,D: coughing,E: lie, Knowledge: The question suggests that there may have been something said by the friends during the chat that would cause a loss of trust. The other options (fever, smoke, laughing, coughing) do not seem relevant to the context of trust and chatting with friends. "Lie" is the only option that directly relates to trust and could cause a loss of trust if someone was found out to be lying. Answer is
--target-- lie
--input-- Question: He came from old money and had a fortune, but he made new money making shrewd trades where? Options: A: eat cake,B: cookie,C: stock market,D: real estate,E: treasure chest, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person made their new money through shrewd trades, which is commonly associated with the stock market. Real estate could also be a possibility, but there is no mention of it in the sentence. "Eat cake" and "cookie" are nonsensical options that have no connection to the context of the sentence. "Treasure chest" may suggest riches, but it is not a likely way to make money in the modern world. Answer is
--target-- stock market
--input-- Question: Animals make up a large part of the? Options: A: carrying cargo,B: favorite,C: ecosystem,D: nature,E: ecology, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that animals play an important role in something larger.

Options: A: basement,B: cardboard box,C: ocean floor,D: high school,E: container, Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a storage item that can be bought at a shop to put unused items in. The most logical option is a container that can be purchased from various stores. Basements are typically not items that can be purchased at a shop, and the ocean floor is not a location for purchasing storage items. Cardboard boxes could be an option, but they may not be as durable as a container. High school is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- container

Options: A: heartburn,B: overeating,C: happiness,D: being satisfied,E: gain energy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has digestion issues and eats a meat-filled breakfast, which can be a trigger for heartburn. Meat is a high-fat food that takes longer to digest and can cause stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest (heartburn). The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- heartburn
--input-- Question: What is a prisoner sentenced to do? Options: A: scape jail,B: dream of freedom,C: become a hairdresser,D: attempt to escape,E: do time, Knowledge: The phrase "do time" is a commonly used colloquial term for serving a sentence in prison. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of being sentenced to prison. "Scape jail" is not a proper grammatical construction, and "dream of freedom" and "become a hairdresser" do not relate to the legal penalties associated with committing a crime. "Attempt to escape" may be something a prisoner may try to do, but it is not what they are sentenced to do. Answer is
--target-- do time

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- writing down

Kew Gardens is a famous botanical garden in London that is known for its extensive collection of plants from around the world. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- kew gardens

Options: A: pot,B: museum,C: garden center,D: formal garden,E: backyard, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking to acquire a rosebush, and the most likely place to purchase one would be a garden center. Garden centers specialize in selling plants and gardening supplies, and would likely have a variety of rosebushes to choose from. The other options do not seem relevant to obtaining a rosebush - a pot could be used to plant one, a museum would not sell plants, a formal garden might have rosebushes but would not necessarily offer them for purchase, and a backyard is where one might plant a rosebush, but not where one would obtain one. Answer is

Options: A: feel important,B: trust himself,C: own house,D: electrical circuit,E: know what time, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a certain thing may result in a person feeling confident in themselves. The phrase "trust himself" implies that the thing is related to self-confidence, which is a common trait of successful individuals. The other options, such as feeling important or owning a house, do not necessarily lead to increased self-confidence or trusting oneself. The options "electrical circuit" and "know what time" seem unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- trust himself
--input-- Question: What are cats often known for? Options: A: whiskers,B: sharp teeth,C: purr,D: four legs,E: sharp claws, Knowledge: Cats are often known for their unique ability to purr, which is a low vibrating sound they make when they are content or relaxed. While cats also have whiskers, sharp teeth, four legs, and sharp claws, these do not distinguish them from other animals in the same way that their purring does. Purring is a defining characteristic of cats and is often associated with their affectionate and cuddly nature. Answer is
--target-- purr

Answer is
--target-- fabric store

While grapes may be found in a kitchen (such as in a fruit bowl or refrigerator), the most likely place to find a single grape is at a fruit stand, which typically sells a variety of fruits in small quantities. The option 'food' is too broad to give any specific information. Answer is
--target-- fruit stand

Options: A: grab,B: look down,C: throw,D: falling,E: may fall, Knowledge: When climbing up a cliff, it is important to grab onto rocks or other stable objects to ensure safety and prevent falling.

Additionally, the word "soothing" specifically refers to something that has a calming effect, which fits with the idea that the music helped the man to relax.

Answer is
--target-- soothing
