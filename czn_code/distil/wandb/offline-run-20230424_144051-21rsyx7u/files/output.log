Options: A: midwest,B: countryside,C: estate,D: farming areas,E: illinois, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James is searching for farmland, so the best option would be "farming areas".

Procreation is a common tactic among animals, allowing them to communicate and coordinate their responses in the face of danger. Listening to other animals is also common among animals. Answer is
